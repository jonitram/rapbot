[Intro: DJ Drama & Lil Wayne]
Gangster, gangster
DatPiff dot com, world premiere
Okay
Yeah
I'm reloaded (gangster)
Chill out, yeah
So after D6, I text Weezy
It's rough
I say, now it's time for a vacation
Guess the iPhone autocorrected
And he thought I said "now it's time for a Dedication."
We gon' bring it y'all
So now y'all got a twenty pack
What's your address?
You're welcome
And not your email address neither
D6: Reloaded
Hundo, leggo
A Dedication!

[Verse]
Looking in the mirror, all I see is money
Bop, bop, but if I was blind, all I hear is running
Plug went to jail Saturday, 'posed to meet him Sunday
He said his bitch flushed the work, time to do some plumbing
Gotta love the way we comin' though, we keep it coming
Wolves never cry wolf and you could feed us onions
Pledge allegiance to the region that's beneath and under
The southside from your blind side, Stevie Wonder
Hunger Games, ain't no games when we speaking hunger
We greedy fuckers, eat your supper, pick our teeth and mug ya
The pocket bussin' out the muscle, bitch, I'm bleeding blubber
And I been drunk and I can't trust you 'cause I'm seein' double
And I been ballin' like the Rucker, nigga triple-double
And now it's war, and they want peace but it won't fix the puzzle
You drop the ball, if you a beast, you won't be quick to fumble
If I'm too deep, then get a bigger shovel, dig a tunnel
If you a beast, then that bitch can't get a nickel from you
I'm the only one that speak, when we in the huddle
Make a pussy nigga leak, then jump in the puddle
We comin' deep, to your street, 'bout to rent a shuttle
Every day of the week, if I hit the street, I gotta hear the hustle
Every day of the week, I gotta get loaded, loaded, skip the bufferin
I got it made, and with that said, I gotta tip the butler
I like my bitches mustard, business hushed, and Bentleys custom
Bitches suffering 'cause the system fucked 'em, now they fucking
They can't hide they battle scars but they can hide they stomachs
Niggas like Niagara Falls how they mouths are running
But we making caviar out of flounders, guppies
Stand tall but I'm a munchkin to my pile of money
Got down and dug it, found a nugget, made a mountain of it
Don't need a crown, gown or nothing, I'm the king of subject
Chocolate, brown, cream, and fudgie, and I'm peanut buttery
Fuck the fuckery, I go skullduggery, it get ugly
Niggas thuggin, we got babies smuggling in they Huggies
Niggas juggling different kind of drugs, Feds struggling
Sippin Actavis, activist like Fred Douglass
Goodnight, sleep tight, watch the bed buggies
She give me ass, she give me head, I call it headbutting
Walk in a room full of buttons, press the red button
Blow this bitch to shreds, get my skateboard, and shred something
Lead pumpin', you dead, pumpkin, go 'head, dump 'em
Redrum 'em, goin' hard in the paint, Andre Drummond
Headhuntin', Good Will Huntin', still stuntin'
All or nothin', Warren G to Warren Buffett
Stormin', floodin', lightnin', thunderin', Carter coming
Like karma coming, my bitch pussy's the warmest oven
Need morning lovin', she foreign, Donald might bomb her country
Thick as fuck, no panties when she got on the onesie, whoa
Time to get this paper though
You ape or ho, bitches in line to get this snake fa'sho
We take the dough if they don't pay the dough and that's fa'sho
We make 'em vegetables and we don't even like vegetables
These niggas extra broke, we break a nigga down to decimals
We up in México to see the plug, and not electrical
High cholesterol, you niggas salty, I'm the pepper though
Your bitch ain't half a ho, she wanna be in my next episode
I'm a steppin stone and that .380, that my chaperone
It blow like saxophone, and when the smoke clear I'ma stand alone
I'm from the terrordome, yeah, that New Orleans, home of methadone
Cops on megaphones its so much bad luck, ain't no leprechauns
I been called a stone, pocket full of stones, on the corner
Moving stones, Papa was a Rolling Stone, I'm so stoned
In this bitch, waiting on Babylon
Bible on the dresser, next to the gun and Tylenol, silence off
Spike a bitch drink like volleyball, Olive Oyl
Skinny bitches, can't get in the ride at all, not at all
I'm involved in a real private war, time to brawl
Niggas don't want lil Tune to take these diamonds off
I'ma talk crazy to a deaf nigga, these niggas blind
I'ma still throw up my set, nigga, steel tote in your chest, nigga
Hell no to a yes-nigga, fuckin' right to a bad bitch
She can fuck around and get her ass licked, still can't get her ass kissed
Black fist, middle finger to taxes, the police and they actions
I'm still pickin' out mansions
Still dicking' down such and such, still fuckin' with so and so
Still fuckin' my bitches' friends, never fuck my woadie ho
Still talkin' about Hollygrove, still talkin' 'bout coke and dope
On the set in that OVO, on the jet in that OVO
I don't threaten I go for broke, wanna step and go toe to toe?
No bullshit at this rodeo and all my clips Pinocchio
Tunechi, bitch, for nothing, drops mic

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Well, I can't technically 'cause it's connected, but, but, you get the expression, Mula, welcome, thank you for joining
Dedication 6, this some sick shit
Umm, first of all, I wanna thank Drama for doing this shit again, and always doing this shit for his dawg. My nigga, one time. Thank everybody involved, everybody involved. My team, my team is my fam. Everybody who put they fingerprints on this shit, 'preciate everybody
So the definition of Dedication has changed for me since the first one, since the second one, since the third one, whatever. It's because, umm, whenever I put it out, umm, it's life. And since I don't write none of my shit, I'm coming from the head. And what happens is, when you rap so long or when you do it so long, all the things in your head, you done used up. So what happens is you gotta start using something else and coming from somewhere else, and that somewhere else is ten times out of ten your heart. And, umm, that's what this Dedication 6 project is
But, uh, yeah, the definition is always different because I'm always going through something at that time of my life, you know what I mean. I prolly was fucking your bitch on Dedication 4, and the whole fucking shit was dedicated to her, you know what I mean. I dunno. Whichever one that wasn't, that didn't do as well as all of the rest of them, that was definitely the one that was dedicated to her



[Verse 1: Belly]
Yeah, look
She used to sell me dreams by the milligram
Chasin' highs we'll never feel again
I told her bring it back and make it real again
I told her bring it back and make it real again
Still got your number in my trap phone
I hit the pussy, get the same high
I know your homegirl waitin' for you back home
I pull up and fuck you at the same time
I won't ever hit you from the main line
Got some nerve blowin' up my land line
Bitch, you must be out your damn mind
Bitch, you must be out your damn mind
Locked inside the room, just the two of us
What made us love each other is what ruined us
I almost overdosed in the hills again
Tell her bring it back and make it real again
I only hit you from the trap phone
Come pull up and get your back blown
Close the door and put the latch on
Won't save her but she hit me on the bat phone
Bitch, you got me poppin' pills again
Hittin' Vegas with a mil to spend
You got the wave, baby, I just want to swim again
Ooh, bring it back and make it real again
Woo, phone blingin', my phone blingin'
Phone blingin', my phone blingin'
I could sell this line for like a quarter million
I could sell this line for like a quarter million

[Break: Belly & Jadakiss]
Trap phone
Trap phone
Trap phone

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Know we got whatever, what you tryna spend, God?
I don't pay the bill, I just change the SIM card
They say tomorrow ain't promised so I'mma live it up
If I don't got your number saved, I don't give a fuck
I'm in the sky gettin' high my crew is the hardest
A hundred K every day as soon as I charge it
And I pray that them people don't properly get me
If get bagged, I'm keepin' it on my property with me
Whole lotta bad bitches that's plottin' to hit me
I can't wear your shoes, dawg, they not gonna fit me
The heart of the city, yeah I'm the backbone
And I'm ready to die over my trap phone

[Verse 3: Belly]
I only hit you from the trap phone
Come pull up and get your back blown
Close the door and put the latch on
Won't save her but she hit me on the bat phone
I'm too numb to ever feel again
Trying to find out where the feeling went
Told her bring it back and make it real again
Told her bring it back and make it real again
She used to sell me dreams, 'bout a milligram
Chasin' highs we'll never feel again
Told her bring it back and make it real again
Told her bring it back and make it real again
I only hit you from the trap phone
Come pull up and get your back blown
Close the door and put the latch on
Won't save her but she hit me from the bat phone
Phone blingin', my phone blingin'
Phone blingin', my phone blingin'
I could sell this line for like a quarter million
I could sell this line for like a quarter million

[Outro: Belly]
Trap phone, trap phone
Trap phone, trap phone
Trap phone
Bitch, you childish as fuck, stop tryna act grown



[Intro: DJ Drama]
Ride with mula, yeah thats the mob
Come check with Dram, and do ya job

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm not worthy of your controversy
I'm not thirsty baby, I'm allergic, colder than a hockey jersey
Dirty like Kentucky Derby, I was lying on a gurney
I don't wanna die early, I was screaming fuck the world
You was singing like a bird, yeah, never be concerned or worried
Two girls like Laverne and Shirley, wake up in the morning early
Tell 'em that I love 'em dearly, they say oh my god have mercy
Shining like I got on Jergens, you can hear my diamonds screaming
Like they just met god in person, oh my god the squad alerted, I confirm it
They hop up like Kermit, come to bless you like a sermon
My house lit like Pee-Wee Herman's and you know I bought it furnished
I'm determined like attorneys, y'all lil boys ain't got attorneys
I just hope she not a burden, I just hope she got a purpose
That first week was power surging, oh my god the socket working
I been listening to the money, it been telling me it's coming
Sound like music to my ears, like a symphony of hundreds
Momma told me I'd be special, Grandma told me I'd be something
I made sure they wasn't guessin, made the most out they assumptions
Being everything but simple, stretch a dollar like a limo
Got a grill in one dimple, got my deal without a demo, Tunechi

[Hook: DJ Drama]
Ride with Mula, yeah that's the mob
Come check with Dram, and do ya job
Thanksgiving is the name, IceBox did the chain
Rolex for the watch, motherfucker, Plain Jane

[Verse 2: Jay Jones]
I got issues, I got problems, we got missiles in the chopper
Got a hoe from the Bahamas let me swordfight with her tonsils
Brought the hoe up in the condo, had a party with Fernando
I got condoms in the dresser, Percocets all on the mantle
All they handle, name a bitch that I ain't fuck and I'ma bag her
Keep it real, if I ain't fuck then my bros Tune and Mack done had her
Got a bitch cook like a chef, I had a hoe from out the Mef
She like to suck dick wit no hands, she say she do shit with no help
Control myself, I been working overtime I owe myself
I like my bitches thick and quick to go and lick below the belt
I brought a goat to Hollygrove, flew your hoe out to my shows
What happen on these tour buses? Like Vegas, nobody knows
Got a plug on line 1, had to put momma on hold
Talking numbers trying to see how I’m gonna get mama that Ghost
Talking big money for sure, I don’t trick money to hoes
I’mma keep running until I’m getting three hundred a show
Yeah bitch, ride with the Mob, slob on my knob
Get some bitches back to work and do the dishes, that’s your job
I’ve been sipping, if they say I ain’t that nigga then they lying
I put coke on the table, made her read between the lines
I sit back waiting my time, now I’m flexin’, now I’m winnin’
I’m at Saks or I’m at Lenox, credit card ain’t got no limit
Got a Mac with a extension, want see murder? Be a witness
Y’all lil boys just mind yo business 'fo' y’all swimmin with the fishes
Wait, yeah, I got the wave, I got the juice, I got the sauce, yeah ho
Smoking the green, really it’s verbal, so I’ll be calling it hard
Woah, South Beach with a bad bitch, I was just in the trenches
I was just in a Honda now I’m skrrting in a Bentley, Jones

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Why don’t I use social media? Hold on. That’s why! I’m way too high for that shit, man. I will be pressin' all kinds of wrong shit. I can’t follow ten- two fuckin' directions [?]. Everytime I try to fuckin' order something, uh, you know what I mean, if it got two extra fuckin' screens that you gotta go through, I’m straight. You know what I mean, it’s just too much. Probably gotta be the same button to pressed to accept the shit, or deny the shit. I wouldn’t know
That’s why I don’t fuck with social media. There ain’t no other reason you know what I mean? People probably think I got like a real strong reason. Like, you know what I mean, no, ‘cause, nah man, I just don’t know how, and I be way too twisted. Like, way too twisted to be fucking with that
I don’t really text, none of that, like it’s just though
It’s just, like, I’m not tech-savvy at all, I’m just sorry
But if you come sit down with me and smoke one with me, I mean you’re gonna have an awesome time. It’s just what it is. I’m very social



[Hook 1: Lil Wayne & Stephanie Acevedo]
You can throw up peace, I'm throwin' squad up
Had to get the dreads bleached, the James Blonde look
I'm 'bout to put my hands on her like E. Honda
She walkin' around in a Young Money Tee without a bottom
She squad
It's a Secret society, these niggas tiny, I'll be your body
Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, Mula, Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team
From the rooftops

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Young Tune winnin' now
You know I been winnin' then and now, anyhow
Anyway, don't start no shit if you can't finish loud
I've been away, I've been around
I've been busy doin' business
Mind your business 'fore I shut your fuckin' business down
She say my lyrics like a lifeline when she down
She checkin' bitches off my timeline when she down
But all them bitches on the sideline, out of bounds
Watchin' us play around

[Verse 2: Stephanie Acevedo]
Stephanie and Weezy now
The birds birds birds are you singing now?
They gonna' keep a lil Puerto-rican out
A lil' souvenir gotta get me now
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Turn Xan on your bitch you are just Plain Jane
I just laugh at the shit with my bad bitch gang (gang gang)
Cause' you ain't a bad bitch without a YM chain

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I second that shit you ain't lyin' that's game
I tell your nigga meet me outside in the rain
I shoot him up like a hundred times then again
Again and again, are you not entertained?
Ain't no better drugs than the ones I know
I done went down on bitches I don't know
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
And right now I'm both, got me talking bout you hoe

[Hook 2: Lil Wayne & Stephanie Acevedo]
Said she really love the blonde look
So she dyed her shit we look like Weezy and Madonna
Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, Mula
And I'm screaming
Fuck your team, fuck your team, fuck your team, Like 2Pac
Sip slow
No blowin' highs, Nn killing vibes
We touch each other, touch the sky
She rub her eyes
She cried Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, Mula
She cried Money Team, Money Team, Money Team
And I zoom out

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I said "Tell me who you loyal to?"
Is it Weezy? Is it Wayne? Is it Tunechi? Is it gang? Or these no-names hanging with a nigga with a name?
How you poppin' pain pills and you living with the pain?
You can't tell me that ain't horrible
And my love always free when the lights get dark
I know love isn't cheap I got a nice-ass job
You look pricey to me, I'll rip your price tag off
Baby "Tell me who you loyal to?"
Do you start with the money or the man?
Does it end with your heart in your hand?
Fuck it if the money bag in the other hand, that was the plan
Let that nigga spoil you
I guess somebody else on grind mode
But a nigga that provide though
Put his pride to the side though
You my slime so

[Hook 2: Lil Wayne & Stephanie Acevedo]
Said she really love the blonde look
So she dyed her shit we look like Weezy and Madonna
I'm 'bout to put my hands on her like E. Honda
Cause' she walkin' around in a Young Money tee without a bottom
Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, Mula, Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, zoom out
Nigga you could throw up peace, I'm throwin' squad up
Had to get the dreads bleached, the James Blonde look
She saw my pic on IG, now she's inspired
She dyed her shit we look like Weezy and Madonna
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
That's some sick shit
Money Team

[Skit: Lil Wayne]
See, this Dedication mixtape series is so important to the culture because they say it is. It's plain and simple, plain and simple. I don't label it important to the culture. If I have ever labelled it important to the culture I was feelin' myself and smellin' my drawers -- uh, pause -- I'm old, my mama used to always say that, my grandma used to say that "You smellin' your drawers." -- but anyway, I don't know if y'all people say that, I'm from the south -- but yeah, the Dedication mixtape series is important to the culture because the culture say it's important. So that's why I still jump my ass in these motherfuckin' booths, wherever I can find a booth, most likely the same one, and do my motherfuckin' thing. And I gotta keep doing my thing and that's why I do my thing because the culture say it's important. They say "We want that, we need that, we gotta have that." It make the-it make the world know what I mean? It make the music world spin, and that's what it's all about, and it's 'cause they say it



[Intro: DJ Drama & Lil Wayne]
I'ma just say this shit right here
The greatest mixtape series of all time
Care to debate me?
Uh-uh-uh-mmm
Yea, I thought so
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Keep that shit on Twitter, y'all ain't lit, y'all litter
Keep that shit in your shitter, or eat that shit, don't spit up, rrr!
Keep my bad bitch did up, keep my main bitch, put up
Watchin' me do push-ups
She was playin' with herself and I looked up, damn!
Your thot need to get her look up
You plottin' on me, my foot up
Your squad ain't hard, that's cushion
That ain't sauce, that's puddin'
Tunechi across her bosom, damn!
Shootin' up the jurors, damn!
Don't name my pistol, I name the trigger
Benjamin Button, push 'em, bam!
Y'all just pussy, get buried together and let 'em play footsie
Y'all just wussy, I got some bullets
Gon' pull up in hoodies and come take a look-see
Better play hooky, I got some hookers
Hookin' up with some politicans and some athletes
And some college niggas, send your missus on all kind of missions
I'm the sickest nigga skippin' doctors visits
But my pots is pissy, smokin' hockey sticky
Put a stockin' on my face and hit a lick in'
When this shit get ugly, I go Pretty Ricky
I don't fuck with rats, neither Minnie, Micky
I don't fuck with cops, that's the piggly wiggly
Fuck my bitch's friends, and they friendly-friendly
While your bitch givin' me her twenty-twenty
Like she tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like she tired of Macy's, JC Penny's
I got bitches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it
If we winnin', win it
I know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it
So I had to tint it and I had to rim it
And I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the Blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to riches, need happy endings
Then it's back to business and we laugh at sentencin'
Hungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses
Hungry artists or starvin' artists
In the kitchen, restaurant and cafeterias
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Better pay the difference to the racketeers
Now your good luck lookin' like you crackin' mirrors
Now the artificial become sacrificial
That's a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples?
With an ass that jiggle with a grab or tickle
With a throat deep enough to land a missile
If your nigga miss you and he have opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a nickel
Now we at his villa, aiming at his pillows
Hair triggers, fingers finna act like bristles
And I catch a triple, flip, kick, jiu-jitsu
Throwin' pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit
Neither of her friends do, I think that's official
Got my neighbor's eyes bigger than the Simpsons
And her man is simple so I had to pimp her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a sec', I'll go at your neck
And send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrra!
Yeah, cannibalism goin' animalistic in a land of civilians
These niggas clones, copycats, and chameleons
Once they dead and gone, no paraphernalia
When she left her thong, that's paraphernalia
Sound familiar? My plug's Sicilian
He the one who told me that sometimes
You gotta leave ya la familia, behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I'm the reason
Got they eyes wide but too blind to see it
With friends like those
It make me text all my enemies and tell 'em I don't need 'em
Hallelujah, power intruders
Bitch walk around my house like Hooters
Towel user, power user
Molly mixed with white girl, Molly/Susan
Niggas talkin' out their bowel movers
Turn they homies into flower choosers
Turn your kids into father choosers
Make your bitch a widow and your mom a cougar
I'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter
Clap at you, if you don't die, I'll boo ya
Tell a doc that's tryna to save your life
And runnin' wires through you, he could die next to ya, rrr!
I'ma make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter
Let her partner shoot it, we pull out the movie, win awards
She got a Golden Globe head and an Oscar booty
Niggas prostitutin', these rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Not even 'bout pollution
Ain't got a house to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in
Change in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it
In route to Houston with a contribution
Full of Monster juices, monster too slow
Macho, Cujo, macho mucho
Big bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrrr!
I got a Greek freak, she call me Antetokounmpo
Just follow the kupo and I know that you know
I'm hotter than soup, she still swallow my soup bowl
I'm out of my loophole, you outta the loop, though
Got all these niggas on silent and mute mode
The power to do so, my pockets is sumo
Gettin' the mula by the minuto
Mafia Nuvo, I am the uno
Real boss nigga, should model for Hugo
Fuck with me, I go Lolapaloozo
Pull up trigger finger, holler, and pull up
Pow, pow, pow, sound like a symphony
Or opera, two-door, hittin' some new notes
And I am the maestro and you just a typo
Private flight, don't fly in too low
I'm wiser than you know, a private school flow
I got me a new ho and now it's a duo
One went to college and one went to ju-co
I had to ask 'em, what's four plus two though? Rrr!

[Outro]
My ultimate basketball dream team starting five would most likely be umm, of course Imma have to start with Kobe Bryant, umm. This gone take a minute, umm, Chris Paul. Uhh, Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James. And umm, oh you know I'm gon say Steph Curry. Steph Curry. You already know, thats my starting five. I got money on them. Holla at ya boy



[Intro: DJ Drama]
A YMGM Collaboration
Young Money, Generation M
Get with it!

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Squad poppin', like the Pentagon
Squad poppin', like the renaissance
Squad poppin', like the Thriller song
And you pussy ass niggas thrill is gone
My squad lit like a strobe light
Squad lit on a slow night
Squad ain't got no types
Cinderella, Pocahontas, Snow White
My squad poppin', my bitch shopping
My niggas thuggin', my bitch robbing
I'm inside cuddling with the choppa
Working on the stove, like a novel
Diggin' in my pockets, tryna find the bottom
Codeine got the drink all soggy
And your queen got my dick hard body
There's a stick up in my drawers, armed robbery
My squad poppin', like the white house
Squad never need time out
Squad way up on the ninth cloud
Way up here, we got iCloud
My squad lit like a strobe light
Every night, any night, all night
6 hoes and they all dykes
And all they need is one mic
My new attic full of dead bodies
Old attic full of dead bodies
Bedroom full of red bodies
I got your main bitch headlining
She cry to me, said, "You're no fair!"
Cried to me, said, "You're low fare"
Dry pussy with no hair
So we showered together and the soap fell
Then I ask her how the dope feel
I don't care how the hoe feel
I kick her ass out the dope house
And she can ask her ass how the door feel
Squad poppin' like the Pentagon
Thot talk like Jenny Jones
Smokin loud like an intercom
I'm goin keep it summer all winter long
Squad lit like the sunlight
You gon have to squint or use on eye
No Mike Tyson, this a gun fight
Had to hide my guns 'cause they gun-shy
Squad pop like the Pentagon
Had to put a few killers on
If you don't want no static
You gon' have to put some antennas on
Wait, drop top with the titties on
Bitch bounce like a tennis ball
Pussies hatin' like menopause
Its a jungle out there, Senegal
Wait, drop top with the tinteds on
It get ugly when I'm pretty stoned
Fat pockets with the skinnies on
I'm dead right but I'm living wrong
No red lights, my limits gone
My meds right, I'm Trippy Jones
My wave right like Billabong
My diamonds dance like Diddy Combs
Her headlights I turn em on
She wanna go to Mars, that journey long
I'm gon' fuck her hard till her sternum gone
My diamonds sing, she learn the songs
I woke up, like this hoe
I'm burning pot like Crisco
She a Crip hoe but she a nympho
And we color blind and you know love is blind
In each others eyes, we butterflies
Rock and roll like Hummer tires
I dont even got to be her number 1
I'm her number 6 and she my number 9, get it?
All these drugs scientific
All these boys science fiction
Softer than a flying ribbon
Walkin all 9 innings
Talkin shit while I'm shittin
Defecation expensive
Destination exquisite
Dedication 6th senses
I'm the shit up in the restroom
Guess who up in my guest room
Smack her ass leave a flesh wound
Weezy F Baby, test tube
The Martian gets high as Neptunes
I fuck your bitch, how is that news?
And you ain't shit to a raccoon
I go ape shit on these baboons
The diamonds still doing dance moves
The money still makin' fast moves
6 feet or 3 pair of shoes
You still underground where the grass grew
Headshot that's a hairdo
Blood drop like shampoo
Young Vidal Sassoon
Oh well, no Shamu
She clap her ass in the lambo
We catch your ass gettin fast food
It happens fast then we vamoose
Rat-a-tat to the tat-poof
I go Apple Jack to the Froot Loop
I got milk, sauce and the Ragu
From the body on the side walk
I chucked to the chalk in this kids classroom, six shit

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Craziest shit Drake ever bought me as a gift was um probably some, some jewelry or something like Drake buy real extravagant gifts like so, I don't, you know, forgive me for saying I don't remember but it's like the gift be so extravagant meaning like I probably use it every day so when you use something everyday you totally forget who got that shit for you,I 'm sorry you just do.  and so he get you those type of gifts when I say extravagant I mean like uh the house I probably live in was probably bought by Drake you know what I mean shit like that



[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, Dedication 6, of course
Shout out Guru for sendin' me the beat, too
Young Angel, Young Lion
More Life, no dyin'
Yeah, alright, I got it, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Super Bowl goals, I'm at the crib with Puff
He got Kaepernick on the phone, he in a whole different mode
Angel hair at 2AM for Bey and Hov
Just to show 'em how I treat the city like my humble abode
Ayy, tell me if TD Bank is approvin' loans
I'm thinkin' of payin' Wayne what Universal owes
My nigga spent a lifetime goin' platinum and gold
He should own half of the label, shit outta control
Somebody get Larry Jackson on the phone
I need some ownership if we pressin' go
'Cause business is boomin' on behalf of me
I need a bite outta the Apple like Adam and Eve
We gon' have to break the billi' curse
I need my paper long like "A Milli" verse
Or too long like a sentence from a Philly judge
Fuck is the point in all the beefin' when we really blood?
Nobody wins when the family feuds, nigga
Everybody gotta eat, we can't exclude niggas
I make the crib, expandin' pools and expandin' rooms
Addin' Hammam Spas with tannin' booths, nigga
That's truth, no boost, nigga
But this isn't all about callin' truce
I'm still dishin' out verbal abuse
That shit could get re-introduced
If somebody got somethin' they urgin' to prove, nigga
Inspirin' to the youth
New Years Eve, lookin' like a royal flush
Wait, we all in the same suit
I'm Hall of Fame in the booth, nigga
My karma makin' the news, nigga
This pudding taste like the proof, nigga
If I ever see Trump, he better salute niggas
Much as we do, nigga, for real

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Six shit

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I could care less 'bout your squad, I don't connect when I'm flyin'
I'm on a jet and it's mine, I just hope the weather is fine
I took the jet to Dubai, I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet way to Africa, shout out my nigga Akon
Your bitch sweatin' my squad, please get the sweat out her eye
I put the dick in her spine, I fucked the bitch in her prime
Don't get my credit declined, give all the credit to Moms
I flipped the bird at the Bird; hey, what's for dinner? Popeyes
These chickens got bird flu, and they chirp, chirp too
Always sung, never flew, these boys Hot Girls too
If money grow on trees, I climb and rest in that bitch
Build a treehouse and knock the bird nest out that bitch
Stuck my neck out and shit, then got the heck out that shit
And when I did, I took the special effect out of that shit
Tunechi F 'round this bitch, the best thing left 'round this bitch
All you niggas some bitches, I feel like Hef 'round this bitch
You call her Stephanie, I call her Steph 'round this bitch
Now back to whippin' the baby on some step mama shit
I come direct with my shit, I come correct with my shit
A blank check on your face, put some respek on my shit
Branches startin' to shake, here comes the leaves, get the rake
I want my piece of the cake, it should be sweeter than cake
Here come the leaves, get the rake, and we ain't leavin' the rake
We made the cleanest escape, although I bleeped in your face
You playin' wit the right one today, your flag is a white one today
You wearin' em tight ones today, check me or write one today
You playin' with fire today, the Angel and Lion are greats
Oh my God, lightning strikin' twice in this place
Should we make a wish or should we make it right in this place?
All this motherfuckin' beef, I need some rice on this plate
Talked to your wifey today, she feelin' triflin' she say
Talked to the sniper, he say he aimin' at diapers today
Pick you off like pickin' peppers, Peter Piper today
So tell your squad I say "BLAOW" like Spice 1 would say
It's Mortal Kombat tonight, it's Street Fighter today
I'm Major Bison, Drizzy lit like Raiden light up the place
You see blue face hundreds 'til you white in the face
Oh my God, it feel like I done life in this place
But swear to God, I got money doin' life in my safe
Put on the gloves like MJ, go from OG to OJ
I make you pay attention then rip your receipt in your face
This for Cita and Nae, this for my people and bae
I got three sons of a gun, them niggas keep me on safe
Hol'up, I am the black god to the church, I am the fat boy to dessert
I am the landlord to the first, got two bangers
One of them go "bada boom," one of them go "bada bing"
I taught these hoes how to love, I taught these boys how to lean
I'm high in the sky and I twinkle, the eyes don't lie 'til you blink 'em
Keep the iron for the wrinkles, the mansion came with the sprinklers
I want Arabian wealth, you snakes come make me a belt
Yeah, you know life is a movie, you niggas playin' yourselves

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Damn, that's some six shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt
It's every man for themselves, it's every baby for sale
And you know life is a movie, you niggas ratin' yourself
I just hope it’s a porn to watch you pussies play with yourself
That's some six shit



[Verse 1: Jay Jones]
Mula! Yeah, look
I'ma tell you all this last time, don't get involved, bullets start Ripping through the walls, hit ya baby mama and the house door
We making house calls, I'm an outlaw, in the south ward
Knock your ass out if you talk stupid
Got a big dick so I walk stupid
She got that hit-it-quick-in-the-car booty
Hold on, bad hoes need to get a raise, lame niggas tryna get away
But all ya diamonds need to get appraised, you in the way
Too many nights I was out lurking, mine in the days, nine days
I'm on Ocean Drive with a bad bitch lyin' in the shades
Sipping Minute Maid, gotta penetrate, let me demonstrate
Got the Jones soda with the drink in it
Got a backwood with the dank in it
Party ain't popping if we ain't in it
Go Blake Griffin, might flex on 'em
That's too much sauce, I bet them hoes know who I are
They treat a nigga like a superstar and that's what I am
I got yo bitch but that's my bitch
So that's our bitch and that's all cool
When you trip out, wan' dip out, she just call me and I fall through
And that's bad news, hold these nuts, cashews
Vroom, I flew past you, new whips here, what the bags do
Past cool, young Jones

[Verse 2: Euro]
My enemies should get a good breakfast and a cup of coffee
I know refugees that don't rush things, they kill 'em softly
My closet still got Nike boxes and a couple corpses
Look, even though I'll never sell my soul, I got a couple offers
Don't think about it, I smoke about it, I drink about it
They wrap the body, then rap about it
Sink the body, then sing about it, zip the body, then sip about it
Fuck the world, I'ma still get some cool things up out it
If a CEO wanna dance all in my videos, I need a big deposit
Swerve, swerve, I'm back on 'em
My bad, I'm turning my back on 'em
I fuck, then see if Tune, Jay Jones, Hoody, or Mack want 'em
Real shit, I've seen good girls go to airports with that pack on 'em
Trill shit, I've seen bad bitches with good genes but I slack on 'em
I ain't focused there, Gotham City, got Batmans and Jokers there
I'm in the club but I'm in the cut
They got cameras here like Oprah's here
Since a kid, I heard gunshots, mothers cry, all the shit soldiers hear
So I had to "abracadabra," "voila," just to make hope appear
Young!

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Told momma, nana, I'm doing my count
Don't ruin my count, bust two and I'm out
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Mama, nana, I'm doing my count
Don't ruin my count, bust two, and I'm out, voila!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Magic dust, yeah that's a rush
Got her cracking up, crying all at once, man, that was fun
I'm spazzing up, I'm gassing up that Cali stuff, that massacre
I'm magical with chemicals and smashing stuff, Metallica
Satanical like Skeletor, you greener than a salad bar
I leave from here to Africa to read some Maya Angelou
Impractical, you acting all DiCaprio we trap and go from casserole
We back and forth in traffic with that Macklemore
That magic snow, it's always cold and my freak on that molly water
I met this bitch on Collins but she out the hood, her mama cook
I'm on the way, I'm on a stage, the Magic show, I feel like Dave
I walk on water, float in air, I'm over there, I'm in your face
I pop up out of nowhere, bop-bop at your doorbell
Disappear in thin air, all we leave is smoke there
Smoking roadkill, she on coke here
Stash is sticking to her nosehair
I'm a magician in the motel, moving tricks for wholesale
Hold on, abracadabra, the data don't matter
We rata-ta-ta-ta over the chatter, we got mo ammo than grammar
Hammers and hammers, pull up in Lambos
Shoot up the cameras, die in pajamas
Find you with Sam and your wife and your mamas
All in your family, I'm balling like Magic, voila!

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Momma, nana, I'm doing my count
Don't ruin my count, bust two and I'm out
Voila! Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know I'm too real
Voila! Voila! OVO shorts, high socks
Music is art, Basquiat, niggas is squares, hopscotch
Time out, na-na, I got sauce, you dried out
I'm big boss, you big mouth, magic show, don't miss out, voila!

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
What haven't I done yet?
I haven't Bungee jumped, err, haven't been to Mount Everest, err, take that back, I've probably have been to Mount Everest. Probably flown over it, probably rolled past it and it just was twisted, you nah mean?  That's real shit, real shit, real shit. Holla at my friends, they will let you know slime has sat down and probably ate with the president, and whatever president it was at the time, totally don't remember, you nah mean? But I do remember, Obama saying my name in a speech, shoutout Obama. But still, what haven't I done yet....release Carter 5



[Verse:]
I keep the blamma in the drawer with the pajamas
I keep the ammo in the bananas
I keep the standards high as the Canyon
I treat the Grammy's like some medallions
I treat the randoms like some companions
I treat the weed like some azaleas
I got more value than I got failure
I got more flings than I got flair
I don't dream if I do not have nothing to wear
You see what I mean and that's why you stare
I know you believe, I know you beware
I know she a fiend, and this an affair
If momma a queen and poppa a bear
You run out of steam, you run out of stairs
I run in Supreme, and get something rare
She run to the team and now she a player
We live on the edge, we die in the air
We sick in the head, but pockets is well
We tiptoe on eggs, we out of our shell
Our vision is red, the eyes are as well
We can't pay attention, we got to pay bills
It doesn't make sense if it's not making mills
We do not take pictures, we're not taking L's
If y'all love to listen, then I hate to tell
If y'all scared to visit, then I take it there
If heaven is real, then y'all fake as hell
Cut off your heels and bounce on your tail
I'm on a mission, survival is real
Man, fuck how I fix it admire the repairs
I'm talking six but my mind is on twelve
Poppin' prescriptions on top of the hill
Even the devil advised me to chill
I told that nigga, stay out of my hair
She just want to fuck in the throne
Shit get too deep and they dug up your bones
I'm sippin' that Sleep and I'm smoking that Gone
When you reach your peak, we gon' cut off your arms
She sniffin' that King and she mix it with Kong
Her clit got a ring, and my dick got a horn
This is what I call a risk and reward
We cutting it close, give the ninja the sword
Fuck what they think, man these niggas don't know us
This shit is sick and it get in your pores
And then you a corpse, and then is the morgue
Me, I'ma hustle until it's the Forbes
I swore, it was no more than a chore
The house by the water, condo by the shore
I'm sure, I'm all about that manure
Cooler than leather and hot as velour
I'm not the one, when it is war
I'm on the front until combat is done
And I got your tongue, stomp on it once
Then smile at your young, they see I'm having fun
Shit don't get brazy, 'til I say go brazy
Run up on your haven and pop at your nasal
Your baby gon take me straight down to the basement
Gun to the head, she get down to the basics
No dramatization, we popping these gauges
Even the neighbors gon' feel the vibrations
Behind desperation, it's just in our nature
So cold-hearted, perspiration turn to glaciers
Ovations, better be loud and bodacious
And then I'ma take me a bow and be gracious
Wipe the gun off with my towel
Throw it in the crowd and then take a pow at the spacious
I'm out of my mazes, I'm out of my cages
I'm out of the labels, I'm kind of escapist
I profit, I praise it, I spend it, I save it
I buy me a nation, you renting on Avis
I'm in it, I sit it, I did it, you said it
You killin', you playing, I'm friendly, I'm faded
I get way too high to get through the hiatus
You look in my eyes and my pupils dilated
I'm true to my ratings, I'm glued to my statements
I just want to dive in the pool of my payments
I'm in and outrageous, I'm rippin' out pages
You runnin' your mouth, see how quick you can chase it
And then you rephrase it, we stick to invasions
The stick is malicious, equipped with a laser
The temperature blazin', the tension is raising
You smell the dead once, gotta live with the fragrance
Sickness is real, the meds is too tasty
Death is related, happy we made it
Keeping it dirty like Sanford and Grady
The Young Mula baby, I'm back from the 80s
Dedication, sick, shit

[Outro:]
My favorite movie quote is "You got 14 bricks in that bag right there?" That's my favorite movie quote. That was Cam talking to, uh you know Mitch and all them, that was uh, damn I always forget the name of the movie and it's my fucking favorite quote but it ain't my favorite movie, but like that's my favorite movie quote. My favorite movie, if you wanted to know, if I ever said it, I never said it, it's Sixth Sense, so don't ask me why, I see dead people, you know what I mean, so I got the fuck away from them

O-M-W, B-M-W, N-E-W
I got that R-A-W, for the L-O-W
That's non-refundable, that's L-A-W
And we hate deductibles, like police hate untouchables

They verify you by your dental records nigga (Six Shit)

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Fuck the city up and I got the glizzy tucked
Dick hanging from the mop, look like a billy club
Flyest niggas from the city, bitch, that's really us
You pussies talking, boo boo boo, now you really fucked
Ridin' in the range with Maine, we switch lanes
With my bottom bitch, walked the beach in Biscayne
Real P shit, that's that M.O.B. shit
Look at me now, these pussies said I wasn't gon' be shit
Yeah, got a homie named Trel from Hoover, he might shoot you
Red rag hangin' out my right pocket, but I'll blues you
When them roosters touch down, we make them bitches cock-a-doodle
Take a shot at me over a beat, bitch, I'ma shoot you
Got a bitch named Vicky, she pretty, she keep me stiffy
Glock .40 in her purse, don't tempt me, her finger itchy
She ride so I keep her with me
She shy but not with that glizzy
She high from hittin' the blizzy
Eyes red like trippy
Hoody rollin' up, that boy smoke like a hippie
Fill my double cup up with mud, that's right, I'm sipping
Yeah, retarded with it, I just might be the hardest with it
And you a rat, you be politickin' with the Sarge, Lieutenant
Fuck all you bitches
Gudda



[Intro: DJ Drama & Vice Versa]
A Dedication
Rest in peace Fredo Santana
Say that she used to be a lifeguard

[Chorus: Vice Versa]
So much fake love, I been drowning, drowning
Pop me a perc, in my zone and it's timeless, timeless

Pop me a perc, in my zone and it's timeless, timeless
I've been so hot, tell a nigga come find me
Been at the bottom, look down and I bet you gon' see diamonds

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Don't ask me for shit but this blunt or this dick
Fake love in the air, love bugs turn to ticks
That's more than enough, Pink Floyd in the cup
Burr, I always pick up, 'less she callin' my bluffs
Smell it, like it, buy it, light it, hit it
Mix it with some molly now we gettin' scientific
Bought another house just to put more pots to piss in
Bitches got they hands out, I shake it like we just did business
This just business, wait
Oh my God, I'm drowning in her kidneys, she like (ooh)
I just listen and the higher notes she hit it
I know I sound like a grizzly and the cocaine look like crystals
That's that white girl, call her Chrissy, hol' up, listen, see
You fuck it all up
You put that wall up
You feelin' yourself, but I can't hate
'Cause you got that soft touch, okay
You standin' in rain and driftin' it
You lookin' for change but penny pinch
You swallow your pride, I'm sippin' it
You drown in your tears, I swim in 'em
6 shit

[Chorus: Vice Versa]
So much fake love, I been drowning, drowning
Pop me a perc, in my zone and it's timeless, timeless

I've been so hot, tell a nigga come find me
Been at the bottom, look down and I bet you gon' see diamonds

[Verse 2: Vice Versa]
I'm off the codeine refill my cup
Robotic coupe while I'm pullin' up
Was feelin' down so I spiked my cup
Was in need of you so I hit you up
Hollywood, I'm in a loft
Catch a plane, Randy Moss
Bag 'em up, ship 'em off
Fuck the law, what's the cost?
Please don't be freaks on me, ooh get the snakes on me
Been "What's the cost?" Get 'em in, get 'em off
Pop a perc I take off
Got a bitch [?], then she claim she from Mars
That bitch a liar, though
Say she a rider, bro
Say that she also a model, bro
Say that she used to be a lifeguard, savin' you
You don't see me drownin' hoe

[Verse 3: Marley G]
Marley don't shoot 'em, but I still keep a chopper on me
Trap in silence, if they want you know that I'm a-(ooh)
Niggas hatin', debatin', don't wanna see me prosper
My flow is ill as fuck, niggas better call a doctor
Over when the fat lady sing done sing like an opera
Back in the G, I was flippin', runnin' through the projects
In the backyard with Tune ballin' in a pair of Balmain's
Last time I bought my bitches, I swear I love 'em all, mane
I be high as fuck, I be fly as fuck
My bitches is nasty, fuckin' her from the back, she callin' me daddy
With two in Miami, all for the family, do it for granny
I go with my move, nothin' to prove
Droppin' Choos, wearin' jewels
Couple thou' on the shoes
Shawty wet like a pool
Bitches see me and they drool
We don't [?]
YM, never lose
It's my time, no snooze
It's my time, no snooze
YM, never lose, yeah

[Chorus: Vice Versa]
So much fake love, I been drowning, drowning
Pop me a perc, in my zone and it's timeless, timeless
I've been so hot, tell a nigga come find me
Been at the bottom, look down and I bet you gon' see diamonds
So much fake love, I been drowning, drowning
Pop me a perc, in my zone and it's timeless, timeless
I've been so hot, tell a nigga come find me
Been at the bottom, look down and I bet you gon' see diamonds

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
The craziest place I've ever seen a Lil Wayne tattoo on someone is... you ready? So, I'm 'bout to explain it, um... inside the lips of their pussy. Um, that's just the craziest place. So like, even when you see the pussy, she can show any man her pussy, he won't see it. She has to literally open her pussy up for you to see the name. Shout out- shout my homegirl, that's my homegirl, one time for her. I love you, girl. What's the craziest place I haven't seen a Lil Wayne tattoo is when people come up to me and say "You know I got your name on me, but, like, I can't show you right now 'cause I'm in work," or, "I can't show you right now 'cause," whatever. You ain't got my fuckin' name on you, shut the fuck up



[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Beep beep, beep beep, beep beeeeep

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Yea, woke up to niggas sounding like me damn
I smoked one and went my ass right back to sleep okay
These rappers needs some law and order Ice T, god damn
They can't touch you Tunechi, Poison Ivy, man
I roll up and smoking like some hot tea yeah
I woke up and couldn't believe I got sleep damn
You woke up and then you try to live the dream
But before you check yourself, check my history
I ain't never been a stormchaser
Or just a fly on the wallpaper
I ain't never been a tailgater
Always been a bail maker
If it heaven sent right now, she gon' give a nigga hell later
If you don't get the shit right now
You gon' love to hate the smell later
I tell her hold up, your pictures don't entice me
She told me pull up and then she heard a light screech, yeah
I woke up with a white bitch under white sheets
She got a black heart, telling white lies through her white teeth
Black eyes from always tryna fight sleep
Ran into your wifey she says "Tunechi, wife me"
Hello, I'm so spicy I got her sweating like Keith
Though our time brief, she be on me like briefs
Ethica, Ethica, Ethica
Heffanie calling me Hefner
F-ing her all in her exiter
If he textin’, I’m killing the messenger
All hail the dead in America
Your ex be hatin’ like eczema
That nigga fake as a wrestler
I poke him straight in his retina
Anyway baby I’m feeling ya
Feel like I slipped and I fell in ya
But that nigga slipped and he fell for ya
Gotta be way more carefuler
These niggas no one to everyone
They play too much and never won
He got you a room at the Sheraton
I can get you your own area
Helluva, helluva, helluva
Girl the way you be taking this D from me
You act like you spelling something
Man this D put a spell on her
I’m deadly as my cellular
My diamonds sing like Mahalia
You gotta make a name for yourself
But these niggas fake as an alias
I don’t see no comparison, no barbarians
I am not a human being
And you’re humanitarian
I ain’t trying to get booked again
Don't fuck with no librarians
Fell asleep in her wet pussy
I woke up in that aquarium, hold up

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Woke up to niggas lookin’ like me, damn
Throw up and go my ass right back to sleep, ugh
You woke up connected to some IV’s
Beep beep, beep beep, beep beeeeep

But your bitch got me shooting porn, yeah
I’ve been trying too hard
Wow, wow

Going too far, yeah
I’ve been trying too hard, yeah
To fuckin’ hide these 2 horns, damn
Sick, sick, sick

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
My friendship with Mack Maine is far, far, far, far, far, far more than a friendship. That's my fuckin' brother. I've known Mack since the hood, Hollygrove. He had the biggest house in the hood it was right on the corner. I'm not sure if the whole house was theirs but it was huge, he had a big ol' basketball court on his backyard and everybody used to drape out, ball in his backyard. And umm, since he lived on the corner like you can always go and chill and play basketball on his backyard and then like always be right there on the corner in case some shit pop off. So yeah me and Mack been down since the hood. He went to a good school, I didn't go to a too good school but then we ended up goin' to the same school, the school is actually called Mack Maine, know what I mean, and then he got known for fuckin' over niggas freestylin'. You know I mean Mack is cold at ribbin' I don't know if y'all call that roastin' or with all that shit y'all call it but uh he cold at that period. He could tear your ass up, make you cry, make you want kill him. That type of shit. He wanted them nigga [?] still be laughing overtime and actually have you laughing but still mad that's one of them niggas. So yes, when you know how to do that don't Lord let you know how to rhyme and he knew how to rhyme, so he used to kill niggas on that shit so that's how we really jammed up on this music shit
Shout out my nigga Mack



[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Big body on brabus, that's all I know
Big shotties in the closet, that's all I wore
Screaming "money over power"
Quote, un-quote
And if the bread get too low, kidnap John Doe (hold up)
I just fucked your bitch in some Young Money flip flops
I'm smoking on that loud and you can hear a pin drop (hold up)
I just kissed my bitch and I left codeine in her mouth (yeah)
Swimming in my money, I smell chlorine when I count (get 'em)
Skating and mating, I’m spinning like Daytons
I’m winning like Peyton, I’m Christian like Laettner
I'm putting some straightener, into all of these Satans I'm
Wilder than Nathan, Goliath on David
I'm quietly waiting I'm trying to be patient but
They want me to wait for Simon to say it but
I am too faded, talk to my agent or
They talk about you to your congregation
Man, no conversation or negotiation
No affiliation by association
I need confirmation for my compensation
Or we make a corpse out of your corporation
I need my donation, take drugs in rotation
That AK gon' sound like a standing ovation
They landing your facial, your bandana rosacia
I'm all about numbers, comparisons, ratios
Collateral, collateral, Xanax and adderal got me unparralleled
Me and your bitch compatible, go together like a parachute and a "geronimo"
This dick is mechanical, but he get too casual up in the vaginal
I pop a Viagra, she hop like a kangaroo, suck like a snaggle-tooth
I ain't got time for no rumors when I am not human, or you men, I'm booming
I'm fucking her, fucking her roomie, I'm platinum versus aluminum
I'm shrooming, I visualize what I'm assuming
My vision is gloomy, but fuck it I zoom in
And now I see movement, and I'd like to thank all the niggas that schooled me
But I still might shoot up my class reuinion
I'm sipping that Houston like it's communion
Smoking some weed, bright as a petunia
I'm walking around Miss America like I'm the king, king of Zamunda
Been hanging around with my shooters when you was still hanging out with Mr. Cooper
Which one of you niggas want beef?
I'm putting your name inside the chalupa
Money since the Mayans, thugging since the riots
Cystic simplifying, higher than Orion
Lying off the diet, eat the whole safari
Pop a cork about it, keep it soft and sour
Watch the market tower
Find a wooden counter, knock on it twice and count ‘em
Competition, clown 'em
Opposition chowder
Watch the bitches shower
Optimistic mama
Common sense ain't common
Top position scholar, so far from the bottom
They can't hear me holler
All I say is our, all I say is our, our father
My li'l bae a model, pussy taste like cobbler
Make me As-salaam Alaykum bottle
What more can I say about it, pray about it
I just race the Rari' left it way behind me, taste the mileage
Loud ass blatant diamonds
I think they the loudest, waking zombies
Break a face or promise, give me steak lasagna
Hate your honor still my mama's baby, and my baby mamas
They some riders, can't deflate them tires
I’m still chasing commas
Nigga I made Big Tymers
And I’m still taking time to make it timeless
Dedication problems, sick shit
Ay yeah, yeahhh..

[Skit: Lil Wayne]
The nicest thing a fan can say to me when they approach me on the street is any fucking thing true, anything real. You know what I mean, that’s the nicest thing. I mean like, even if its cliché, cliché I can still tell when that cliché was straight from your heart and that’s all you could think about, all you could think to say when you saw me or if you meant it, like even if it's that, like I said just when it's real. You know why? Cause sometimes people can say things that's so real to them that they don’t even know that, you know what I mean, some of the things they are saying isn’t fact, you know what I mean, official. But you know, things like so what I mean like example: you might walk up on somebody, I might walk up on somebody on the street and they might, uh, they might... shout out the valet from today, umm well yesterday, shout out the valet from yesterday, before you opened the door of my car, you’re looking in my eyes, you’re a young cat too, you look me in the eyes and you say ahh, and he couldn't, his English wasn’t all that, he said: I like the new album, I really like the new project, and I said to him I was like thank you man, he meant that, cause he looked me in my eyes and he even opened my door before he said it, you know what I mean, so I was like damn you know when I got in the car I was like damn it's not a project. You know what I mean I don’t even consider that damn shit not an album just a mixtape, you know what I mean, but to him that was real, that shit was real, could be a project not an album, so shout out to homie. I left him a nice little tip you know what I mean



[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi gang
Pump, what's up?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Lean made me swerve in the cruising lane
Your money funny like Pootie Tang
Had to leave Cash Money, had to do my thing
New password, new username
My new teams loves having newer things
One phone call and my jeweler came
I bought you and you and you and you and you a chain
Daddy got bust at the gun range
My drugs cost more than your mortgage
The hoes gon' throw 'em out regardless
I'ma throw the hoes another party
Nigga, I ain't got hoes, I got an audience, damn
Every week fashion week, runway
Fly the bitch overseas, one way
The bitch come around here and go both ways
Made her eat so much pussy, need a lunch break, damn
She ain't even hable inglés
Got the booty with the thighs and a shrunk waist
And right between her thighs is an entreé
And she know I'ma need more than one plate, yeah
And I look up in the sky through my sun shades
Lookin' in the eyes of a sun ray
I ask it "Can I shine," it say "All day"
Made the sign of cross over the heart ray, Amen
Boom bang, red beam, blue flame
Tunechi got clique like Hussain
Stick that kick like Liu Kang
My bitch got tits and two chains
Damn, I'm tied to the track of a money train
You blind to the fact, that's a fucking shame
I still come bread with the butter stain
Got the world on my back, you got puppet strings, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang
Groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Your bitch fucked 'til the Uber came
My clique love sipping Houston drank
Yeah, that's purple, magenta, and fuchsia, man
My bitch love watching Boomerang
My kids love watching Stranger Things
It's gorilla warfare, y'all orangutans
She gon' hit the cocaine like a hurricane
It gon' make her do a whole lot of other things
It gon' make her takeoff then jump off of the plane
Make her race racecars in the lovin' lane, pew
Make her drop the top in the summer rain
Make her pussy come again, tell these pussy "Come again"
Fuck her hard fuck her soft, she want love and pain
She gon' have to walk it off or do the running mane
Nigga, fuck the game, fuck the game, fuck the game
What they think it's wonderland? Think it's fun and games
These funny ass niggas think they Martin Payne
Try to walk it like you talk it, never walk again
Hundred thousand flat in a rubber band
But I could get you whacked for some pocket change
And my niggas snap like the paparazzi gang
And you know they say a picture say a thousand things
She wanna be with me and feel alive again
She wanna join a gang but she gotta train
I never knew her name, still forgot her name
Thots shall never ever thot again
I flew her to Columbia, her body changed
She came back home with the model frame
Now all the hoes wanna know her doctor name
All these hoes looking for a power change, brr
Damn, who that is? Him? Not again
He don't get the picture 'til it's out the frame
Nigga washed up like a box of Gain
He don't get the scripture 'til the choir sang
Amen, Tunechi mane, Tunechi mane, mullah gang
Live life, Superman running through the veins
Street smart, nigga, I could be a tutor mane
My shooters aim at your motherfucking pupil, mane, bang
Don't talk stupid, it's your block, we gon' be loopin', mane
My gang stay away from the trooper gang
Spit flame like my name King Koopa, mane
But if the pussy sweet, you can call me Sugar Shane

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang
Groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Your bitch out of my groupie gang
Can't blame her, its you to blame
Eat xan bars like Nutrigain
Coochi better smell like sushi mane
Another pain pill, that'll sooth the pain
Tunechi mane, Tunchi mane, mullah gang

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang
Your bitch out of my groupie gang
Your bitch fucked 'til the Uber came
My bitch love to do hookah mane
My black barbies got booty fame
My white barbies got Hooters fame
I'm a eye doctor that you should blame
When she tell you she don't wanna see you again
The lean made me swerve in the crusing lane
Your money funny like Pootie Tang
Had to leave Cash Money, had to do my thing
New password, new username, ayy

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Thots shall never ever thot again
Thots shall never ever thot again
Thots shall never ever thot again
Thots shall never ever thot again



[Verse 1: Marley G]
Black out my red bandana
Dressed in all red like Santa
Me and Tune riding in the Phantom
Spiked out my Pineapple Fanta
My flows sick like cancer
Doing the drugs at a random
Bitch I ball like Amber
Keeping one in the chamber
Fucking your bitch in the Hamptons
Checking my diamonds, nothing fugazi
All of you niggas is shady
Crack flow, 80s baby
Hella wavy on them hoes
Pop a perc on them hoes
Giver her something for her nose
All them bitches down to roll
Swerving all in your lane
Dont crash, feel the pain
Dope music in my veins
Skating on em with Lil Wayne

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Way too much ice now I'm skating on em
Flexing I pull out the Wraith homie
He saving these hoes put a cape on him
New freezer the water my neck homie
Pronto took her to the condo
I'm balling on niggas like Lonzo
Too foreign you dont get no convo
Too rich I dont need no broke hoe
Sprite in the Pineapple Fanta
Kill every song like cancer
Put it in the lock do damage
Once I fuck a bitch she vanish
I bust on her boobies
Pull out the camera we making a movie
Look up to Lil Tunechi
I came out the trap now I smoke out a cutie
She graduated but the head stupid
Might tell my shooter go and do it
Off the lot had a top gone lose it
And they all taking pictures they groupies
Fuck the Patek, she a real model but I just want the neck
Give me a sec, big jet on the way to a check

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, okay, okay, me and your bae soulmates
But if that hoe disobey, it's back to Chipotle
Beat that pussy up, no foreplay, Oscar De La Hoya
She ride this dick like horse play
I send her back bowlegged
She go right, left, she go both ways
When he asked she say "no way"
I can make her play her role and roleplay
I can make a redbone feel rosé
AK leave his head gone with no face
Wutang, my killers Ghostface
All my AKs 24K and Gold Diggers dig your grave
Okay, Tuncehi Keyser Söze
Smoking that gas need rolaids
Sippin lean fast that's slow pace
If the bitch bad I showcase, okay
100 thou cash on the pillowcase
One in each hand that's lifting weights
This dick make a bad bitch richocet
Your bitch is in here swallowing like Minute Maid
God damn, okay okay okay
D.E.A., D.O.A
I aim right at your shades, then let off that roach spray (brrr)
Y'all boys soft as crochet, I take off with no brakes
I try not to leave no trace, but I dripped sauce the whole way
Damn, I'm a boss I pay me
I got lost like KD
I go off like Dray Green
Pop a perc go KG
Man I'm unwired like Dre Beats
Repping them big big big B's
All y'all drenched restin in peace
Dedication 6 sick six feet
Six shit
Medication quick quick quick please
I'm impatient Imma need a MD
The doctor said all I need is M-E
Your thot in here tryna get me tipsy
Your thot in here tryna give me hickeys
And now she's tryna tell me how to live free
Never let a stripper give you tips please
That's some six shit

[Outro: Lil Wayne]

[Pre-Chorus 1: Lil Wayne]
She said, "I love you Tunechi"
I said I love me too
She said, "Can I come through Tunechi?"
Bitch, come through, we through

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Cut all my exes off, higher than cholesterol
Tried to play professor and the bitch take a semester off
Wishing on a superstar, trippy life is too bizarre
Quickie in my roofless car, bust a nut and blew the horn
When she snort this Loius Vuitton and she keep the new ones on
Life in living color, she the one I spend them blue ones on
And it's right where you belong, girl, he make you Uber home
When he calls she threw the phone, I just cut the music on
Waiting for some Dominos, listenin' to some Commodores
Acting like some carnivores, after that we comatose
I ain't tryna bullshit my baby and she know me better
Told her, more money, more Prada, and the more the better

[Pre-Chorus 2: Lil Wayne]
She said, "I love you Tunechi"
I said I love me too
She said, "What you up to, Tunechi?"
I said, "That's up to you"
She said, "I don't want much Tunechi"
I said, "And you'll need two"
She said, "Babe, you so crazy and I'm your crazy glue"

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Because you make it look good, make it look easy
I never come down, I'm too high to see me, hold on
I make it look good, I make it look easy, yeah
I never cool down, I'm too hot for TV, hold on
She make it look good, she make it look easy, yeah

We make it look good, we make it look easy, yeah
We never cool down, we too hot for TV, hold on

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Your ex, he so petty, fast food to her veggie
Gas you with unleaded, I had to 211, yeah
Now you're too hot for TV, but I tell you don't sweat it
Don't wax or trim them edges
I treat that bush like Reggie, yeah
But I don't smoke no Reggie
I give her Coke, no Pepsi
And her best friend a lesbian
And I want more affection, yeah
Been fucking on the legend
The Michael Jackson, Jesse
Lil Tunechi, Elvis Presley
Hendrix, Future, past or present, yeah
I'm too hot for TV, too high for my exes
Been ready to triple x's
Too much drugs, sex, and weapons, yeah
And I'm too high to see me, diamonds shine in 3D
No Fugazi CZ
Y'all boys really PG, damn

[Verse 3: Lil Twist]
I make it look good, I make it look easy
I get it from Weezy, been too hot for TV
She said I love you Twizzy, I said I love me too
Now bring that big ass over here and come do what we do
She pull up on the kid, she suck my dick and try to kiss it
I told her, "Hold it", call her friends, if they ain't fucking, can't get in
I fuck her on the kitchen counter, drop my kids off on that chin
I tell her face down, ass up, I wear it out like a new trend, oh shit
Lil Twist, drop a four, four, four
Fuckin' crack down on the Act, I'm sippin' slow, slow, slow, yeah
I'm a lil freak on my camera shit

You know we all need fruit
She said, "Babe, you so crazy and I'm your crazy glue"

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Because you make it look good, make it look easy, yeah
I never come down, I'm too hot to see me, hold on
Make it look good, make it look easy, yeah
I never cool down, I'm too hot for TV, hold on
She make it look good, yeah, she make it look easy, yeah
She never come down, she never come easy, no
We make it look good, we make it look easy, yeah
We never cool down

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Don't I make it look good?
Don't I make it look easy?

Don't she make it look good?
Then she never come easy, no
We could never cool down

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Skateboarding these days is going awesome. Umm, new tricks I've landed. Umm, y'all don't really know nothing about that shit. When I say "y'all", umm, I don't mean none of my fans, I don't mean people who don't skate, I don't mean people who do skate. It's just a lil, you know what I mean, it's a skate thing.

So, you know, now that go. You run into a skater there



[Intro: Lil Wayne]

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I said I wasn't gon' love these hoes

She know how much I hate pantyhose
I know how much she love animals
But she let me stomp on her camel toe, damn

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Girl what the deal, though, put up them dildos fuck with a real one
Fuck 'til the sun come, we can still chill, though
Kick it like field goals, lick it like mail, though
Sleep by your mailbox, IG yo' G spot
I kill yo' pill spot, I give a cheerleader somethin' to cheer 'bout
I get you too high, I hear yo' ears pop
You hear my key chain, you hear the birds fly
All gold dust, pull the pills out
You take your clothes off, you tell me go hard, I tell you "No duh"
And we both smoke so I rolled up and we pulled up in my gold tub
And you woke up with soap suds all up in yo' chocha
Fuck it, shawty, it's yo' fuckin' birthday
Almost fuckin' drown me, little fuckin' mermaid
Damn, fuck it, shawty, everyday yo' b-day
And if you want this D, bae, everyday is D Day, boom
I'ma lay you on your spinal cord and you gon' take all this dinosaur
Yeah, I'ma lay you on your spinal cord and you gon' take me on your private tour
Hol' up, I'ma lay you on your pretty face and hit it from the back like you hit the brakes
Got a pretty face and a pretty shape tryna be a star and I'ma give you space
Wait, 1, girl, let's start this shit, 2, girl, yo' heart just skipped
3, girl, and you will see, 4, how good this D can be
5, I love to do you right, and 6 ain't shit if it don't end with 9
Invite yo' friend that's friendly fire
Bitches ain't shit but yours and mine
Ooh, girl I love you so
That's why I always fuck you slow
All these little hoes they come and go
She was just a flame, went up in smoke
And I told myself not to love the bitches
Hard to stop fallin' for a bitch when you trippin'
Hard to stop sleepin' on a bitch when you spippin'
When you sippin'
Can't trust these hoes, can't love these bitches
Then my heart get cold, middle finger with the mittens
Bitches lie through they teeth, I never wanted to be a dentist
Might as well keep spittin', it ain't love it's business
Hoe
Watch that hoe you sleep with, bitch ass hoes be creepin'
Watch that hoe she be wit', who she prolly sleep wit'
Damn, but you know that ain't cheatin'
We should have a meetin'
Watch that hoe you eatin', food for thought, I'm thinkin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I said I wasn't gon' love these hoes
I ate my words like a pussy hole
She suck my dick and my bullet hole
Got on my dick, did the tootsie roll
She know how much I love candy though
She know how much I hate pantyhose
I know how much she love animals
But she let me stomp on her camel toe, damn

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And her clique got a hair trigger
Damn, and her clique got a hair trigger
And her clique got a hair trigger
But the bitch gotta spare a nigga, damn
Watch that hoe you sleep wit', bitch ass hoes be creepin'
Watch that hoe she be wit', oh, nah, they ain't speakin'
Damn, that's that silent treatment, I don't wanna know the reason

[Skit: Lil Wayne]
Umm to help these multiple generations that look at me as the reason they started rapping or the reason why they rap and into music is ... uh ... it's unexplainable. There isn't a word for it. You can't describe the feeling. Um if there, you know what I mean, there's words that's probably close to it, and when I say close I mean light years away from it, words like amazing, awesome, that's probably the closest, and like I said, that's light years away from the feeling, you know what I mean. I can't explain it, it's crazy just to turn on the television, just to see my own children walk inside and be like, you know what I mean, singing something you know like what is you talking about right now, what are you singing, what are you listening to on that iPad, what are you watching? And they be like "such and such" and I be like, you know, what is that, and they be like, you know what I mean, "he loves you Daddy, he loves you Daddy, he always shouting you out Daddy, he always..." and that's when they put me on, you know what I mean. I just sounded so old just now told you how my kids be, man Drama if you keep that shit, dawg you bad, that should let you know that you're older than me

You can turn your phone off and let your name ring
We can take them clothes off and let that thing breathe
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean"
I just put a whole deuce inside a 16
Cried my whole heart out, she cried with me
She like to put the top down and tell me "Let 'em see"
She like to leave the doors up, they look like referees
She like to throw it back until she got back pains
She got her own little special contact name
She take it in the ass, ain't worryin' 'bout the crack game
Me, her, plus another bitch, she don't care if the math change

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I just put a whole deuce inside a 16
Got her reppin' suwoo, she reppin' big Bs
And she ain't worried 'bout fuckin' on a private plane
And she don't do the phone thing, she do the finer things
It's all about deserving things and not designer things
She all about the certain ring and not all kind of rings
All about the shirt things and not the shiny things
Man, she so tired of swervin' niggas, need a tire chain

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night we can't recall it
She lay down and close her eyes, fall asleep open hearted
She done died and went to heaven, I forgot to close the coffin
I'm just lookin' for lil' sexy to direct me from the sorrow
They ain't promisin' tomorrow but she promise to be loyal
So I promise to be faithful, but I'm prolly not gon' chase you
Sit down on my dinner table, eat that pussy like it's catered

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
I just tell my main ting "Since you my main ting
You can turn your phone off and let your name ring
You can scratch yo' goals off and you can thank me
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean"
I just told my main thing "Since you my main thing
Let them have the fame thing 'cause it's the same thing
You can take them clothes off and let that thang breathe
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean"

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
I just poured a whole deuce inside a 16
Yeah she reppin' two countries, yeah she mixed breed
Got her smokin' rapper weed, tryna spit Vs
She been goin' 30 minutes, she just switched knees
Pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary
Pimpin' ain't dead, check the cemetery
If I tell you that I love you, I ain't lying girl
So worry 'bout yourself and not the other bitch I'm tellin'

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night was all recorded
Every day she catchin' feelings, every night I throw a party
That's that "Fire and Desire", I forgot to throw her water
I'm just lookin' for lil' sexy to direct me from the horror
They ain't promisin' tomorrow but she promise that she loyal
So I promise to be faithful
Yeah, Lil Weezy F for faithful, funky, freaky, freshly flavor
Flawless, fleek, finesse, finagle and fatal



[Intro: Lil Wayne]
They give her bread, I give her head
I'm light years ahead, gone
They give her bread, I give her head
I'm light years ahead, gone

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I know she gon' hold the gun for me
Hold it down in court, and hold her tongue for me
She swallow all my kids, then pop a gun for me
Makes some runs for me, all the way cross country
She love me, she even rep the blood for me
I said the plug trippin'
She gon' pull the plug for me, I love it
And all she know is Young Money
Her ex is always trippin', nigga is too clumsy

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Make up on the pillow, make me wanna kill her
But she naked in the villa, taking E I call it Sheila
I took half of a half, she took 3 like Reggie Miller
I just feel her like chinchilla, had to kill her, Bryson Tiller
I know they gon' play this over, wrinkles on my shoulder
My face all in her chocha, for my bae go South Dakota
But my bae go even lower on that roller coaster
She just want a Tesla roadster, I'ma get her somethin' slower
Bet a Bentley Truck to show her, tinted up to hide her ass
Who in that Wraith behind her ass, you ain't even got to ask
She ain't even gotta dance, thinkin' boutta a wider ass
And she already gotta an ass, leave it in the doctor hands
Other niggas, not a chance, she already gotta dare
When I be in and out your ass, baby you sound like jazz
You ask me can your partner crash, you ain't even gotta ask
I'm breaking out the powder bags, turn into Iron Man
What happens in this house stays in this house
Don't worry 'bout that
If what happens in this house gets out
Go check your girl 'bout that
I'm 'bout to put you in my will, where my attorney at
I ain't the type to turn my back, got every type of Percocet
I'm working with the perfect bitch, her body like 187
Then we come together, then we cum together
Rainy weather, ain't it heaven
Ain't no telling what I think, I think I'm ready
My lil married homie Terry talking 'bout a gangster wedding
Oh my god

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I know she gon' hold the gun for me
Hold it down in court, and hold her tongue for me
She swallow all my kids, then pop a gun for me
Makes some runs for me, all the way cross country
She love me, even rep the blood for me
I said the plug trippin'
She gon' pull the plug for me, I love it
And all she know is Young Money
Her ex is always trippin', nigga is too clumsy

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Goddamn
He give her bread, I give her head, I'm light years ahead, pyoom
He give her bread, I give her head, I'm light years ahead, pyoom
He give her bread, I give her head, I'm light years ahead, gone
He give her bread, I give her head, I'm light years ahead, gone
She lie in the bed, I lie in the bed, the shower instead, yeah
We got out of the shower, got back to the bed
That's flowers in bed, that's magic
She lie in the bed, then cry in the bed, I lie on her leg, damn
See they give her bread, I give her head, I'm light years ahead, pyoom

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I know she gon' hold a gun for me
Always down in court and hold her tongue for me
She swallow all my kids and pop her gun for me
Make some runs for me, all the way across country
She love me, yeah
Even wrap the blunt for me
She gon' pull the gun for me
All she know is Young Money
Ex is always trippin' niggas too clumsy, Goddamn

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
They give her bread, I give her head
I'm light years ahead, gone

[Skit: Lil Wayne]
My favorite person to debate sports with is, um, Skip Bayless off top. Like Skip Bayless, that's just the homie, you know what I mean. Like when I say the homie, I mean, like when you goin' to Skip Bayless, when I go to the Skip Bayless show, there's always more conversation off camera, and its always like he can't wait for them to say 3,2,1 and we off. For him to engage in a, um, more whatever, realer conversation, I don't know if real is the right word, a more real conversation, just things like that, so you know
My favorite person to debate sports with Skip Bayless. I do have a second favorite as well, if it's not even a second favorite, but another favorite person I love to debate sports with: Max Kellerman. That's my dude. Love to debate sports with Max Kellerman, that's my slime. And every time I go on his show, he always got a verse for me. You know what I mean, that's the homie
I'ma be alright



[Intro]
I'ma be alright because Dizzy here wilin'

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Uh, ok, time to make my mark, I gave 'em a head start
Now I'm on my Nicki shit, I don't want no fraud
Tryna' raise the bar, grabbin' like I passed the bar
You would think I'm ridin' bikes by the way I handle bars, yeah
New nigga in charge, it's a new nigga in charge
Poppin' all these blues I might turn into an avatar
They ain't wanna see me back, he's back
Human cracking the flesh, sorry I had to relapse
These niggas weak wack, I twist 'em like weed raps
Still on my Nino Brown, still getting Gee Money on G-packs
No stunna man bussin' like Duh Duh Man it's evident
These hoes love me, they say my dick is they medicine
Cosby spikin' gelatin, still pushin' and pedalin'
Settling never, I'm like DiCaprio in The Revenant
Still whippin' and stretchin' it, 2 pots, ambidextrous
I'm a beast, a dog, I see that money I'm catching it
Ya ho throwing it at me, I'm catching it
Don't check me, go check ya bitch
You don't want to get me out of my element
From a tenant in a tenements to owning my residence
Phone still clicking I feel like a receptionist, I'm extraterrestrian
My life's a fucking movie, boy don't get yourself edited
I'm like Steph at the free-throw that piece blow, I never miss
Told you girl how to a whip the girl now she lesbian
You can level up, still won't be on my level then
It's level 10, these niggas hot, I must be kettling
They don't want the steam but I know you want the tea
That's yo bitch, why she only fuck with me?
'Cause I'm balling MSG
Roof missing on this whip, and I need two kitchens
Fuck the DA I ain't never been no stoop pigeon
Won't catch me in no club unless my tool get in
Be smart 'cause Bouncy a fool with it
Son say it's on, 7-11 with it, that's 24-7 with it
Wherever, whatever with it, yeah
Your Momma gonna need a church with a reverend in it
Just pray its a heaven in it and hope that they let you in it, yeah
Boy I expose the truth in guys, cross me and get crucified
Wars on the bazooka rise, niggas get neutralized

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Suicide, it's a suicide
Tell 'em seek and you will find 'cause I'ma lose my mind
Kick a nigga ass then give 'em my shoes to shine
It's do or die, I come from where we used to crime
The Uzi-9 more important than school supplies
The pools is dry, my niggas and the food is fried
The news is lies, the pigeons is too spooked to fly
The rules denied, all the toughest goons is mine
That’s Tunechi’s slimes, they kill you and go do the time
We unified, Young Money revolutionized the new design
We had to leave the flukes behind and super size
The numbers through the roof and sky
Don't look too surprised look through the lines
We makin' moves and strides, groves and vibes I'm too alive
These hoes need to be supervised
They put on a cute disguise, you grooms is blind
She get dick in the Uber ride, Number 2 with fries, I'm pimpin'
Now who am I?
I'm who and why, I'm rude and kind
My cars are computerized,  I'm cruisin' by
Smokin' blunts Ruben size
You fools can try, these tools getting utilized, you euthanized
Blrtt, skrrt, shoot then drive, now who survived?
We comin' back to rewind
I'm usually high, sippin' on the Houston wine
Feel humanized, I want my throne to recline
Jackie red, Julie blind, they Cuban fine, I bruise they spine
I leave and they snooze 'til 9
Superglued to the grind, my crew my tribe
These bitches try to divide, we too divine
Got the drugs to provide, the coolest highs
The greenest green and the white with the bluest eyes
The syrup n' the juice collide, the two combine like suits and ties
Magic, poof, goodbye



[Intro: DJ Drama & Lil Wayne]
Gangster, gangster
DatPiff dot com, world premiere
Okay
Yeah
I'm reloaded (gangster)
Chill out, yeah
So after D6, I text Weezy
It's rough
I say, now it's time for a vacation
Guess the iPhone autocorrected
And he thought I said "now it's time for a Dedication."
We gon' bring it y'all
So now y'all got a twenty pack
What's your address?
You're welcome
And not your email address neither
D6: Reloaded
Hundo, leggo
A Dedication!

[Verse]
Looking in the mirror, all I see is money
Bop, bop, but if I was blind, all I hear is running
Plug went to jail Saturday, 'posed to meet him Sunday
He said his bitch flushed the work, time to do some plumbing
Gotta love the way we comin' though, we keep it coming
Wolves never cry wolf and you could feed us onions
Pledge allegiance to the region that's beneath and under
The southside from your blind side, Stevie Wonder
Hunger Games, ain't no games when we speaking hunger
We greedy fuckers, eat your supper, pick our teeth and mug ya
The pocket bussin' out the muscle, bitch, I'm bleeding blubber
And I been drunk and I can't trust you 'cause I'm seein' double
And I been ballin' like the Rucker, nigga triple-double
And now it's war, and they want peace but it won't fix the puzzle
You drop the ball, if you a beast, you won't be quick to fumble
If I'm too deep, then get a bigger shovel, dig a tunnel
If you a beast, then that bitch can't get a nickel from you
I'm the only one that speak, when we in the huddle
Make a pussy nigga leak, then jump in the puddle
We comin' deep, to your street, 'bout to rent a shuttle
Every day of the week, if I hit the street, I gotta hear the hustle
Every day of the week, I gotta get loaded, loaded, skip the bufferin
I got it made, and with that said, I gotta tip the butler
I like my bitches mustard, business hushed, and Bentleys custom
Bitches suffering 'cause the system fucked 'em, now they fucking
They can't hide they battle scars but they can hide they stomachs
Niggas like Niagara Falls how they mouths are running
But we making caviar out of flounders, guppies
Stand tall but I'm a munchkin to my pile of money
Got down and dug it, found a nugget, made a mountain of it
Don't need a crown, gown or nothing, I'm the king of subject
Chocolate, brown, cream, and fudgie, and I'm peanut buttery
Fuck the fuckery, I go skullduggery, it get ugly
Niggas thuggin, we got babies smuggling in they Huggies
Niggas juggling different kind of drugs, Feds struggling
Sippin Actavis, activist like Fred Douglass
Goodnight, sleep tight, watch the bed buggies
She give me ass, she give me head, I call it headbutting
Walk in a room full of buttons, press the red button
Blow this bitch to shreds, get my skateboard, and shred something
Lead pumpin', you dead, pumpkin, go 'head, dump 'em
Redrum 'em, goin' hard in the paint, Andre Drummond
Headhuntin', Good Will Huntin', still stuntin'
All or nothin', Warren G to Warren Buffett
Stormin', floodin', lightnin', thunderin', Carter coming
Like karma coming, my bitch pussy's the warmest oven
Need morning lovin', she foreign, Donald might bomb her country
Thick as fuck, no panties when she got on the onesie, whoa
Time to get this paper though
You ape or ho, bitches in line to get this snake fa'sho
We take the dough if they don't pay the dough and that's fa'sho
We make 'em vegetables and we don't even like vegetables
These niggas extra broke, we break a nigga down to decimals
We up in México to see the plug, and not electrical
High cholesterol, you niggas salty, I'm the pepper though
Your bitch ain't half a ho, she wanna be in my next episode
I'm a steppin stone and that .380, that my chaperone
It blow like saxophone, and when the smoke clear I'ma stand alone
I'm from the terrordome, yeah, that New Orleans, home of methadone
Cops on megaphones its so much bad luck, ain't no leprechauns
I been called a stone, pocket full of stones, on the corner
Moving stones, Papa was a Rolling Stone, I'm so stoned
In this bitch, waiting on Babylon
Bible on the dresser, next to the gun and Tylenol, silence off
Spike a bitch drink like volleyball, Olive Oyl
Skinny bitches, can't get in the ride at all, not at all
I'm involved in a real private war, time to brawl
Niggas don't want lil Tune to take these diamonds off
I'ma talk crazy to a deaf nigga, these niggas blind
I'ma still throw up my set, nigga, steel tote in your chest, nigga
Hell no to a yes-nigga, fuckin' right to a bad bitch
She can fuck around and get her ass licked, still can't get her ass kissed
Black fist, middle finger to taxes, the police and they actions
I'm still pickin' out mansions
Still dicking' down such and such, still fuckin' with so and so
Still fuckin' my bitches' friends, never fuck my woadie ho
Still talkin' about Hollygrove, still talkin' 'bout coke and dope
On the set in that OVO, on the jet in that OVO
I don't threaten I go for broke, wanna step and go toe to toe?
No bullshit at this rodeo and all my clips Pinocchio
Tunechi, bitch, for nothing, drops mic

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Well, I can't technically 'cause it's connected, but, but, you get the expression, Mula, welcome, thank you for joining
Dedication 6, this some sick shit
Umm, first of all, I wanna thank Drama for doing this shit again, and always doing this shit for his dawg. My nigga, one time. Thank everybody involved, everybody involved. My team, my team is my fam. Everybody who put they fingerprints on this shit, 'preciate everybody
So the definition of Dedication has changed for me since the first one, since the second one, since the third one, whatever. It's because, umm, whenever I put it out, umm, it's life. And since I don't write none of my shit, I'm coming from the head. And what happens is, when you rap so long or when you do it so long, all the things in your head, you done used up. So what happens is you gotta start using something else and coming from somewhere else, and that somewhere else is ten times out of ten your heart. And, umm, that's what this Dedication 6 project is
But, uh, yeah, the definition is always different because I'm always going through something at that time of my life, you know what I mean. I prolly was fucking your bitch on Dedication 4, and the whole fucking shit was dedicated to her, you know what I mean. I dunno. Whichever one that wasn't, that didn't do as well as all of the rest of them, that was definitely the one that was dedicated to her



[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell her four, five, the fifth, ayy

I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
Thirty for a walkthrough, man, we had every slit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we gets in in the rent'
And I'm like "woah"

Diamonds weigh my teeth is sore

My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can never tell you no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
We're hittin' lil' mamas, she wanna have my babies
Sippy on the Panky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (ayy)
Uh, take you to the smoke shop

Dolla Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright

All VVS's, put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though



[Intro]
Yeah, they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yuh

[Verse 1]
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yuh, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
She said, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly"
I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there’d be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies

[Chorus 2]
God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close

Yeah, yeah
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yeah



[Verse]
Ayy, bitch I've been goin' and goin' like the Energizer
Yeah, I'm supplyin' the wood like Elijah
In the cut, smokin' on indica
Might fuck around and compartmentalize ya
They say, they say life is a bitch and if that is the case then I'm finna surprise her
No, I am not an adviser, but I do advise you to pay attention
Never need to mention, I'm that motherfucker bustin' heads
Finna push it to the ledge
Yeah, I've been smokin' my meds
Ain't got no love for the feds
Can't let fame go to your head
Fuck with me, watch where you tread
I'm finna kill it instead
I'm finna, I'm finna, I'm finna
I will, I will do like I've never done it
And I wanna run it and I wanna keep it goin' and goin'
Like infinity, be the only entity to ever rip it apart
From the start like this, from the heart like this
Finna murder it, a million miles a minute, no nitrous
Doin' righteous
I-I been, I-I-I been down this road before
Everybody think that they do but they don't
Swear to God that they would but they won't
Spittin' riddles in the middle of a past-time
Me in my mind, feelin' divine, like yeah
Finna get it like yeah, yeah, like yeah, like yeah (woo, woo, woo, woo)
I done made 20 million dollars (preach)
I don't flex to be acknowledged (preach)
At this point it's common knowledge (preach)
All you haters been abolished (preach)
You in the club throwin' dollars, but I'm savin' mine so my kids go to college (preach)
Or maybe whatever they wanna do (preach)
Just as long as they never say (preach)
"Daddy blew 20 million dollars (ayy)
He had to flex to be acknowledged (ayy)
He in the club throwin' dollars and now cannot afford to send me to college (ayy)
Daddy just wanna be loved, just like everybody wanna be accepted (ayy)
But somehow he had neglected me and my momma for all of this rap shit" (ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that shit (ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that
Who you know dropped the album back to back to back to back to back to back again?
I'm back again to snap again and goddamnit, it ain't no other way around it
Yeah, it's happenin' 'cause I've been livin' in a world on my own
Leave me alone, I'm in the zone where I've been prone to destroy shit
You cannot avoid this, whack mothafuckas have annoyed this
Yes, you know I enjoy this
Preach, mothafuckin' preach
Yeah, I'm tryna reach everybody in the streets, puttin' words to the beats
Each one teach one, yeah I'm tryna reach one
Who the beast one? That be me, I'm the pride to the East one
Tell me how you really wanna do it right now, time to murder this
Shout out everybody, no fuckin' around, ain't heard of this
Heard of us, we ain't goin' nowhere, it's a herd of us
Hold up, roll up
Levitated like I'm David Blaine
Livin' a dream like I'm David Aames
Talk all you want, we are not the same
Step in the spot, now they know the name
Sold more albums my first week than Harry Styles and Katy Perry
If that ain't a sign of the times then I don't know what is, man this shit is scary
'Cause bitch, I've been blowin' up like C-4 and I'm 3 for 3 like a free throw
Anybody hatin' on the boy, take a step back and then deep-throat
Now my phone blowin' up like ring
Like ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring!
That Kevin Durant, I'm a champion
Check the numbers, I'm a champion
Can't sleep on the boy anymore but the haters that love to hate gon' pop an Ambien
Star Lord, champion
Know the name, now they know the alias, that's for sure
Gave 'em 44, now here's 44 more




Letra de "Amorfoda"[English Translation]

[Estribillo]
No quiero que más nadie me hable de amor
Ya me cansé, to' esos trucos ya me los sé
Esos dolores los pasé, yeh, yeh, yeh
No quiero que más nadie me hable de amor
Ya me cansé, to' esos trucos ya me los sé
Esos dolores los pasé

[Verso]
Hoy te odio en el secreto, ante todo lo confieso
Si pudiera te pidiera que devuelva' to' los besos que te di
La' palabra' y todo el tiempo que perdí
Me arrepiento una y mil veces de haber confiao' en ti (huh)
Quisiera que te sientas como yo me siento (siento)
Quisiera ser como tú: sin sentimiento' (-miento)
Quisiera sacarte de mi pensamiento (-miento)
Quisiera cambiarle el final al cuento
Toas' las barra' y los trago' han sido testigo'
Del dolor que me causaste y to' lo que hiciste conmigo
Un infeliz en el amor que aún no te supera
Y que ahora camina solo sin nadie por toas' las acera'
Preguntándole a Dios si en verdad el amor existe
Y por qué si yo era tan bueno toa' esta mierda tú me hiciste (-ciste)
Lo más cabrón es que tú ve' todo como un chiste
Siempre voy a maldecir el día en que naciste
Los chocolates que te di y todas las flores (-res)
Se convierten hoy en día en pesadilla' y dolore'
Yo ya perdí la fe de que tú mejore' (-jore')
Si después de la lluvia sale el arcoíri' pero sin colore', yeh

[Estribillo]
No quiero que más nadie me hable de amor
Ya me cansé, to' esos trucos ya me los sé
Esos dolores los pasé, yeh, yeh, yeh
No quiero que más nadie me hable de amor
Ya me cansé, to' esos trucos ya me los sé
Esos dolores los pasé, yeh, yeh, yeh



[Intro: Anne-Marie]
Oooh-oh, oooh-woh
Oooh-oh, oooh-woh

[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
You say you love me, I say you crazy
We're nothing more than friends
You're not my lover, more like a brother
I known you since we were like ten, yeah

[Refrain: Anne-Marie]
Don't mess it up, talking that shit
Only gonna push me away, that's it!
When you say you love me, that make me crazy
Here we go again

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going away without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Haven't I made it obvious?
Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-EN-D-S
Haven't I made it obvious?
Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-EN-D-S
F-R-I-EN-D-S

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
Have you got no shame? You looking insane
Turning up at my door
It's two in the morning, the rain is pouring
Haven't we been here before?

[Refrain: Anne-Marie]
Don't mess it up, talking that shit
Only gonna push me away, that's it!
Have you got no shame? You looking insane
Here we go again

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going away without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Haven't I made it obvious? (Haven't I made it?)
Haven't I made it clear? (Haven't I made it clear?)
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-EN-D-S
Haven't I made it obvious?
Haven't I made it clear? (Haven't I?)
Want me to spell it out for you? (to spell it out for you?)
F-R-I-EN-D-S
F-R-I-EN-D-S

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
That's how you f****** spell "friends"
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
Get that shit inside your head
No, no, yeah, uh, ahh
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
We're just friends

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
So don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going nowhere without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Haven't I made it obvious? (Have I not made it obvious?)
Haven't I made it clear? (I made it very clear)
Want me to spell it out for you? (yeah)
F-R-I-EN-D-S (I said F-R-I-EN-D-S)
Haven't I made it obvious? (I made it very obvious)
Haven't I made it clear? (I made it very clear)
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-EN-D-S
F-R-I-EN-D-S

[Outro: Anne-Marie]
Ohhh-oh, ohhh-oh, ohhh, oh
Ahhh-oh, ahhh-oh, ahh-oh

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Miss me with that bullshit (bullshit)
You ain't really wild, you a tourist (a tourist)
I be blackin' out with the purist (the purist)
I made a hundred thou', then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I made 500 thou', then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I bought a '87 for the weekend (the weekend)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (what you want)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (what you want)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
And it's like that, lil' bitch

I ain't gon' hold you, I ain't gon' press you, never control you
I ain't gon' front you, keep it 100, I don't know you
Boss like Top Dawg, bossed my life up, crossin' over
Stutter steppin', got a Hall of Fame in all my posters
I've been ready, my whip been ready
My bitch been ready, my clique been ready
My shit's been ready, my check's been ready
My shot's on full, that's Armageddon
I got pull, I hope y'all ready
My tank on full, you know, unleaded
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it
My name gon' hold up, my team gon' hold up
My name gon' hold up, my team gon' hold up
My shots gon' fire, my team gon' roll up
Ménage-à-trois, my queen gon' roll up
I hope y'all ready, you know I'm ready

I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it
I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, skrrt

[Chorus: Future & Kendrick Lamar]
Miss me with that bullshit (bullshit)
You're not a gang member, you's a tourist (a tourist)

Bought an '83 Cutlass for the weekend (for the weekend)
I got a hundred thousand, then I freaked it (then I freaked it)
I made 500 thousand, then I freaked it (then I freaked it)
I put a Rolls Royce on my wrist, oh yeah
Fuck his baby mama, tryna sneak diss
I took her to my penthouse, then I freaked it (then I freaked it)
I haven't made my mind up, should I keep it? (Should I keep it?)

[Bridge: Future & Jay Rock]
La di da di da, slob on me knob
Pass me some syrup, fuck me in the car

[Interlude: James Blake & Kendrick Lamar]
Changes
Is you gon' do somethin'?
(What you want?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like
We like fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria
But I don't see it, I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic
Tapped in when I'm maxed in Comp-Town with the MAC 10s
And the pumps in the background I was absent
Never OG, standout, I was lackin'
Everything else, but doubt in the Magnum
Holdin' Magnums with a Magnum
Nigga, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Boo yaow, boo yaow"
(Yeah, God)
Tee off the day, know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, "Off ya head"
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Fuck integrity, fuck your pedigree, fuck your feelin's, fuck your culture
Fuck your moral, fuck your family, fuck your tribe
Fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars



[Verse 1: Lettie Lutz]
I am not a stranger to the dark
"Hide away," they say
"'Cause we don't want your broken parts"
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
"Run away," they say
"No one'll love you as you are"

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus: Ensemble]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble]
Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades
And reaching for the sun
(We are warriors)
Yeah, that's what we've become
(Yeah, that's what we've become)

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz and Ensemble]
Won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus: Lettie Lutz and Ensemble]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
Gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus: Lettie Lutz and Ensemble, Ensemble]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
This is me

[Bridge: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I know that I deserve your love
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's nothing I'm not worthy of
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
This is brave, this is bruised
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me

[Chorus: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble, Both]
Look out 'cause here I come
(Look out 'cause here I come)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
(Marching on, marching, marching on)
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Outro: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble, Both]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
When the sharpest words wanna break me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
This is me



[Verse 1: Phillip Carlyle]
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny?

[Chorus 1: Phillip Carlyle]
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight

[Verse 2: Anne Wheeler]
You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wondering why
Because we're able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

[Chorus 2: Anne Wheeler]
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours
Tonight

[Post Chorus: Both, Anne Wheeler, Phillip Carlyle]
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It's not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

[Chorus 3: Phillip Carlyle and Anne Wheeler]
How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing can keep us apart
Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

[Outro: Anne Wheeler]
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and
My hands are tied

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive ('live)
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side
Oh well, fuck 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride (huh, fuck 'em)

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the Dawn
Know you wanna ride now (let's ride, let's ride!)
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah
And you sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
See you watchin', don't run outta time now

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Quavo]
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh

Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Quavo! I'm the one that hit that same spot (hit it)
She the one that bring them rain drops (rain drops)
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (hopscotch)
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot (hot)
I make your dreams come true when you wake up (dream)
And your look's just the same without no make-up
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of (mama)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up
You can run inside my life from that fame bus (skrt)
'Cause I promise, when we step out you'll be famous (yeah)
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us (why?)
'Cause when we pull up — brt-brt! — all angles

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the Dawn
Know you wanna ride now (let's ride, let's ride!)

I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Okay though

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me
Baby, okay, okay though

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Lookin' for the one?
Well, bitch, you're lookin' at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the Molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record
I'm just flexin' on my exes, oh God

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the Dawn
Know you wanna ride now (let's ride, let's ride!)
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah
And you sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh

[Outro: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]

Yeah, I'm the one
Don't you know, girl? Don't you know, girl?

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

[Hook: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

[Hook: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day

Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'ma ball 'til the day I fall

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)

Long as these bitches love me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pussy-ass nigga, stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man
Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick; she's on a strict diet
That's my baby, with no makeup she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better then Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said: "‘Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody."
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't!
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said: "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud."
I said: "Baby, just make me cum, then don't make a sound."

Real nigga, fuck these haters!
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, maaaan
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, $69.96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
All my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges; Lil Tunechi!

Pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hating

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate
I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup
For a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons
Jo-John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5
Is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me:
Lance Stephenson

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "Goddamn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you, the bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it (Pinkprint, ayy)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I been praising, my nigga that money talk
I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the "b" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only



[Intro: Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives
Could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call, there's albums to drop
There's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom
Confusing me with questions like...

[Hook: Lil Wayne (& Drake)]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
(And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn' right, alright, yeah)



[Intro: Ha Ha Davis + Chance The Rapper]
You don't want zero problems, big fella!
Yep! Igh!

[Refrain: Chance The Rapper]
If one more label try to stop me
It's gon' be some dreadhead niggas in ya lobby, huh huh

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Ooh, watch me come and put the hinges in their hands
Countin' Benjis while we meetin', make 'em shake my other hand
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings out my lap
Bitch I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap, hey
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
Fuck you thought it was?
You talk that talk that make a lame ass nigga fall in love
Not me, though, bitch you can keep those
Bruh, I'm at your head like Craig did Deebo

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
They be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht, no power steering
Aye, aye, captain
I'm high, captain
I'm so high
Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Yep, yep!
Pull up in the new thing, I'm like
They be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
They say so, ridin' with the payo'
They be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (woo)
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank, check in my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum
Put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless
Lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless
Largest in charge
And born in New Orleans
Get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly
Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie
You know!

[Hook: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done

Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team 'til Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah

[Hook: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done

Believe me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

[Hook: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me

I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 3: Drake]
Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

[Outro: Drake]
Rip rip, nigga



[Hook: Big Sean and Jhene Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes and goes
You say "be real" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (Funny, right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

[Hook]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa ew, time, kill, months, still

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy
I drank too much, please call me a cabby
Penthouse after party hoes want that addy
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like "Why you still talk to my mama?"
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college
What? All because I had you, nigga I dont even have you
How am I suppose to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems he got to deal with

[Hook]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Girl, don't believe them hoes
Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, "ain't no woman like the one I got"
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that would make me a one eyed fuck
Sch, I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

[Hook]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy



[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
If you hatin' you just need some pussy
She fucked up when she gave me some pussy
I said, "I fuck you better than that other nigga"
She say, "Tune I'm 'bout to cum," I say, "I'm comin' wit ya"
She don't like them pretty niggas, sidity niggas
She ride this dick, her titties jiggle, that's my pillows
That's because I sleep in that ho
Hit it when I wake up tell the pigs I say "As-salamu alaykum"
My bitch a choosy lover never fuck without a rubber
Sweet yellow bone thing, I call her honey mustard
Pussy like a sea shell, dick like a V-12
She say I drive her crazy, I say just keep on your seatbelt
Bend it over bust it open for me
Baby bend it over bust it open for me
She say she love me she just loves this dick
Come put that million dollar pussy on me make me rich
Tunechi

[Hook: Future]
She got that million dollar
Million dollar oow, oow

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Crib made her tapout, sauna made her tapout
Jet made her tapout, pilot with the map out
Million on the diamonds, million on the kitchen
Millions on the Maybach, glass top ceilings
Million dollar pussy, sleepin' on Versace
Sleeping on Fendi, sleepin on Cavalli
Married to the money, millions in the bank
Alexander McQueen, rich in the paint

[Bridge: Mack Maine]

And all I want to do is touch it (oow, oow)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Million dollar pussy, million dollar pussy
Six inch pumps, play with his balls dunks
Bald head yep, don't want no Forrest Gumps
Don't let me tell ya twice, already told you once

Who got that baddest pussy on the planet?
D-Boyz love me, they don't understand it
Ooooooooooooooooooh! Deeeep throoooooat!
Million dollar pussy might pounce on that ass
Threw them hundreds until I lose count on that ass

Million dollar checks don't bounce on that ass

[Hook: Future]
[Interlude: Birdman]

I’m in love with your Egyptian skin
And your talk about religion

And I’m ballin' no cushion

Yo.. this is kinda slow
But I know the Jeeps gon' be pumpin it
But this is, this is one subject, that nobody don't know about

[Verse One]
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
When you hear my golden voice, you know it's me
The poetical, energetical rap MC
Well that's not the subject matter of to be cool
I'm just tellin you girls and fly kids, stay in school
I always reminisce when I was in class well
But you feel like a simpletone when you get expelled
Or, even if you have a couple of days in detention
It's just as good as one bad suspension
So when you're grown up, you'll say the same thing
To your kids, be in class before the bell ring
But you know, kids is kids
To them high school is like a three year bid
I'm not gonna tell a lie, I used to cut class
Until the principal straight got in my ass
He said, "Biz the only way you're gonna get a BM
Is to get your education instead of hangin with him"
So I got my head together, and chilled the hell out
And now all the break-breakers says is check him out

[Hook]
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house! {*echoes*}

[Verse Two]
Now this is the second part of this lesson
I'm sayin it this way cause it's my profession
You don't have to go to high school to be an MC
But you got to know the value and means, of money
Cause a lot of parents, they are taxpayers
So it's real stupid, when you disobey a
Principal, vice principal or even a teacher
Cause when you do that, you know you'll never reach a
Higher level, or even your goal
Because, you don't wanna listen to what you're told
So please take heed, to what I say
I hope I'm not sayin it for my health today
Cause if I am please tell me, so I can stop
It's not like I'm your mother sister brother or pop
So come on and listen to me without no doubt
So you can be educated and have, clout

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I'm just tellin young people to stay away from drugs
Cause if you mess with that it'll make you bug
Whatever you wanna, like call it, I'm tellin you
Don't become a drug addict or alcoholic
Because it will mess with your mind and brain
And only thing you wanna do is feen and complain
Cause I'm tellin you just like this off the top of my head
Don't mess with it, cause you will be misled
By other people, devils and demons
I'm Biz Markie, I'm not Alfred Simmons
I'm just tellin you to do this, without no doubt
Cause I'm the Biz and I got the clout

[Hook]

[ad libs and shout outs]



[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
Now this is a difficult subject
About something that's crazy - oh, what the heck
They know they have something that people don't like
And they still continue to disrespect
The thing I'm talking about is an essence
A foreign fragrance with a presence
That you can't see with the naked eye
But to the nose it's a nuisance

It comes in so many forms, it's camouflaged
And it will sneak upon you like espionage
You might not know it cause it won't show it
And you will swear it's just a mirage
It can be with you when you're talking
It will be so close, you think it's hawking
With a bit of a twang it got its own slang
Is even known in New York, and

Everybody know what I'm saying
From here to the Himalayan
If you don't know, you must be doo-doo
This is what I'm saying
About the dragon

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
I think I should go more into depth
About a secret that is quiet as kept
If you have it like Richochet Rabbit
It can ruin your rep
There are ways of preventing this
Check your hygiene and your dentist
You might think I'm messing, but this is a lesson
Godliness is cleanliness

But if you think I'm misguiding you
By saying there's something inside of you
That bothers everybody when you're at a party
And your reactions to it is: "pee you!"
You're sitting there baffled and puzzled
Whatever you have, you wish you was muzzled
But if you want a clue, between me and you
It could be the beverage you guzzle

But if you listen to me
The diabolical energetical B
The I-Z Mza-Mza-A-R-K-I-E
I'm tryina give you H-E-L-P

So I'ma end it off like this
Before you give somebody a kiss
For the one you adore, check them before
You get a crazy whiff
Of the dragon

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
I once knew a guy by the name of Tock
He was one of them kids from like around the block
The kid was cool, had the right gear, and slim
The only thing was wrong, he smelled like a gym
In secret telling rumors, his right guard went left
And his band was playing a song that was funky to def
He was kicking like Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly
Word is bond, that kid was smelly
Even if he would shower and shower
Or sprinkle a day, wouldn't last for a hour
He would always wanna like hang around
His underarms had bass with scents around
I tried to tell him, but he just wouldn't listen
He thought from my heart I was trying to diss him
I started beating around the bush cause he thought I was nagging
I said, "Yo Tock, you got the dragon!"



Yo this one aight though
Yo, me and Cool V
Dis dis dis gon' be dis gon' be our new single
And when you hear this story you'll say it's aight though
Yo yo yo yo Cool V, why don't you give me a cue
One more cue, and then I'm ready to go in

[Verse One]
Don't you like when the winter's gone
And all of a sudden it starts gettin warm
The trees and the grass start lookin fresh
And the sun and sky be lookin their best
Birds be singin, flowers be bloomin
A lot of brand new cars be zoomin
Fly girls lookin the best they can be
And the guys be dukey dukey Dan you see
Besides all that I like the warm weather
Cause that's when you can get yourself together
But I like Easter time with a grin
Cause when I was little we used to go to Coney I-sland
We used to eat a lot of stuff like cotton candy
Cause back then, it was like fine and dandy
You used to get dressed up in double knits
And your plaid suit jackets, they were the shits
The good ol' days, was back then
And the reason I reminisce, cause..

[Chorus: Biz sings - voice slowed down]
It's spring again
Everybody know it's spring again
To the girls and boys and people above
This is the time to fall in love

[Verse Two]
Now girls - have you ever broke up with your boyfriend
And you felt that the world was comin to an end
Sittin around the house poutin for no reason
Just because you thought your man was skeezin
For a couple of days, look gloomy and gray
Thinkin about the ol' happy days
All of a sudden, the telephone ring
He beg for your forgiveness and you know what that brings
Joy and happiness into your life
Before you felt like your heart was stabbed by a knife
I'm tellin you girls, keep the man that you got
Cause if he cheats, you might need a VD shot
You know two wrongs don't make a right
And if you did somethin wrong, don't do the same it's not polite
Please don't make this breakin up a trend, BECAUSE.. BECAUSE..

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now fellas - have you ever met a girl that tried to front
And wanted you to act like you was on a hunt
I used to see my homeboys frown and fret
For a girl that always tryin to play hard to get
I know I caught it myself, I must admit
And said - anything you want you gotta work hard for it
Me the Diabolical, be obsessed?
And go after somethin that a girl posess?
They're really on yours like a pair of drawers
They want you to be like Santa Claus
They want drug dealers, and four-wheelers
Truck jewelry, they expect you to steal her
Sheeeeit, I know they must be buggin
They better hit the streets and do their own muggin
But in this case, you would just overlook her
Send her on her way and say I can't help you hooker

[Chorus]

{*Cool V scratches to the end*}



[Verse 1]
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, "Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof"
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, "How do you like the show?" She said, "I was very amused"
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, "Do ya have a man," she tried to pretend
She said, "No I don't, I only have a friend"
Come on
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 2]
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewing'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say, "Yo, who was that?" "Oh, he's just a friend"
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 3]
So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
"Yo, could you tell me where is door three?"
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend



[Verse One]
I once knew a girl by the name of Monique
She was my childhood sweetheart every day of the week
Whether PS46, or 151
After school I'd go to her house, to have some fun
We both lived in Colonial Projects
I lived in building 48, she lived in building 26
We used to play Ringling, Coke or 1-2-3
But when I'm in Monique's presence, I would just freeze
The relationship began when I was five startin
She was in nursery school, I was in kindergarten
We was more closer than a hand and glove
This is what you call real puppy love
When we'd go trick or treating, I would carry her bag
When we moved to Long Island, it was all such a drag
Cause I know it would be difficult to see her again
I wouldn't miss her more than I'd miss all of my friends
Even though we was little this love was unique
And this is what I say to my love Monique, because

[Chorus - repeat 4X]
"She's not, just another woman..
She's not, no no!"

[Verse Two]
Let me tell ya a little somethin, about Monique
Even though we was little she had a physique
Indian brown skin with a nice complexion
She always gave me tender love and affection
I knew she was different in her own little way
I used to knock at her door bout every single day
I remember when we used to go trick or treatin
I used to snatch bags, so she could sink her teeth in
Crazy big variety of a lot of candy
She would share it with her friends Kim Ron and Fran and
Lee-nette, the girl she called her cousin
We never had an argument, oh we was never fussin
That's why me and her got along so good
Anything I asked her to do, you know she would
We would have family day, in back of building 70
I would win her a prize, so she could treat me heavenly
I don't care what nobody say, because
This girl would make my day, and

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now this is the epilogue of this story
About a young little girl, especially for me
No matter how many years ago I can't forget
But then again 1986 hit
She looked just the same, but in a bigger version
My mind started goin on a love excursion
I started reminiscin to her bout old times
She began to smile, I guess I rang her chimes
I didn't see her again until 1988
And I saw her again, and she still was straight
Now this time I had enough courage to speak to her
I told her would you be with me, and what would occur
Then I asked was, she swingin any capers
She said - no not me, nobody got no papers
I couldn't believe, after all of these years
I was so happy she waited it brought me to tears, cause

[Chorus] - quickly fades out



"Hey Mudfoot, you know what we're here for, lay some treats on us!"

You see, you gotta act like you crippled
Like you just got one leg, and you know you just gotta just
You gotta just, ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-just gotta relax
And just, let the music take over your body and just chill
Cause this is the Diabolical B-I-Z, Emmezah-A-Rrrah
You know me from, "The Biz Mark, Biz Mark"
I already said that already, but it don't even MATTER
Bring the bassline back in, now bust this out
I'm just talkin about, this is gon' be the new thing to take over
The next century, cause it's gettin ready to be the 90's
And I want this to be one of the hottest dances comin out
It's called the "Mudd Foot"
You know, you you can't do "The Butt" off this music
You can't do "The Wop," can't do nuttin else off it
Can't do the "Michael Jackson"
Only thing you can do off this music is the "Mudd Foot"
Can't be doin that "Arsenio Hall"
I don't know I don't know how he do that, m-heh-heh
Or that I.O.U.'n, Scoob and Scrap'n
And anybody else dancin
Only thing you can do off this, is, the "Mudd Foot"
So c'mon, do the MUDD Foot
Yo, I, see, you know I been here
I been in this studio for about a month
I'm tryin to teach Swan how to do the "Mudd Foot"
I don't know what the heck he doin, he-heh-heh
Marley can't even do it, yo
I'm tryin to teach, Cool V how to the "Mudd Foot"
He doin the "Butt Foot" I don't know what the heck he doin
But, the way you gotta do the "Mudd Foot"
You gotta just kick it, it gotta be like flowin y'know?
It gotta be flowin!
I know everybody from Uptown, by the Apollo, Uptown
Way Uptown, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island
Long Island!  Everybody from out of state like Kansas City
California, everywhere, I can't forget New Jersey, Newark y'know
{*fades out*}



One two, one two
The Diabolical's back again
With the Cutmaster Cool V
At the boards my man Paul Sea
But this goes out to my man Danny Dan
The beat man that makes you understand
He want me to tell somethin bout this girl named Kim
I'ma do it like this

[Verse One]
Well it was one of those days when nothing's right with the world
I was half broke, bored, and fed up with my girl
Lookin for somethin to do but wonderin how long
It would take for the next thing to go wrong
So I decided to hang, go out and ease my mind
I told myself you would never know what you might find
I took a hot bubble bath, instead of a shower
Got rid of "The Dragon," it took me a hour
Decided on a sweatsuit, Gucci red and white
Some rings and some ropes, and then I'm on for the night
The Gucci sneakers some cologne, I think Aramis
I look in the mirror and said, "Biz you look - marvelous!"
I jetted out the door, and hailed a taxi
And said "54 in a hurry," and jumped in the backseat
We arrived he said, "$8.50 and that don't count my tip"
I said, "Don't drink and drive -
GIMME MY CHANGE before I bust ya lip!"
The club was jumpin and word is bond
I saw girls walkin around with jeans painted on
Splittin they skirts up the middle, tight leather and lace
Both me and Jimmy agree, we're gonna like this place
Took a seat at the bar, the girl said what are ya drinkin?
A Coke and a smile child, and slid her a Lincoln
Took a sip of my four dollars, she looked at me strange
I said, "Psych I bet you thought you was gonna keep the change"
I made my way through the crowd, it was plain to see
Same everywhere I go, all eyes on me
I sat down at the table, and one of the staff
Said, "Ain't you the Biz" I said, "Yeah but no autographs"
I sat alone in the corner, and sipped my drink
Happened to look across the room and somebody winked
I did the only thing the Diabolical could do
Looked down to see what that I was attached to
Sure enough it was a girl, a sweet female
Her hair and eyes sparkled like ginger ale
I looked lower to her lips, her chin and her neck
And fantasized about the rest, then decided to check
I sent champagne to her table, the waiter asked her name
He returned with Kim, and I almost came
I checked myself and made sure, I looked alright
And told my dick, "Don't worry - we're fuckin tonight!"
Threw her the Kool-Aid smile, and a dash of charm
I stepped to the lady and tapped her arm
But when she turned around, my smile turned to gloom
She didn't look none like she looked across the room
She had big broad shoulders and her titties was big
They were filled with silicone, and her hair was a wig
She had more makeup than Boy George and Phyllis Diller
Ugly enough to be a monster in "Thriller"
Had hair on her chest longer than King Spade
Even though I got a band, I don't need the AIDS
So I hurried out and left, she said, "Please stay"
I said, "Sorry money grip, I don't go that way"
So I stepped out in a hurry, to gather my wits
And thought that's a damn shame, he had nice tits
And that's the last I ever saw of Kim
You wanna know why?  Cause she's a he and her's a him
Like that and-a, like that and-a
I'm not the man called Dantana
You go on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Don't go to Getty, go to Exxon.. {*echoes*}

[Biz Markie shout outs and ad libs]



{*scats*} Biz {*scats*} Mark
{*beatboxes*}

[Verse One]
I'm the original B-I-Z
The Emeza-Emeza-Emeza-Emeza-A-Rrah-K-I-E
Everywhere I go, I always G
I'm thinkin somethin that you never could see
Doin the beatbox and the R-A-P
That's why I'm the Inhuman Orchestra, Biz Markie
I'm here just doin my J-O-B
So I can reach the T-O-P
As soon as I get to the T-O-P
Then I will be D-O-N with the E
I rock New Jersey and N.Y.C
Whether it's at a club or a block party
To my man Capri, Starchild and Brucie Bee
{?}, Baby J, and DJ Marty
The title of the song in the place to be
Is not this or that, it's "Me Versus Me"

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}
Me versus me

[Verse Two]
I think it's time to act up and throw a fit
Cause I'm rockin to a beat that just won't quit
This is the real thing, not counterfeit
Cause everything you hear, I'm doin it
The name of a baseball glove is a mitt
And what I need on my BMW is a kit
A preacher preaches from a pulpit
And my man Benny Hill, got a lot of wit
The rhymes that I say are the ultimate
And the way out anywhere is called an exit
A real short play is called a skit
And New Balance sneakers are legit
The past tense for bite, is called a bit
Everywhere that I go, all attention I get
I used to live by the North conduit
The Biz Markie will always make a hit!

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
This is one thing, that I like to say
This is a different kind of rhythm and rap display
I'm not Frankie Crocker or Lamarr Renee
Cause both of them are radio DJ's
Otis Redding be sittin by the dock of the bay
I'm bound to wreck your body to the break of day
And if you wanna see me at a show, you gotta pay
Cause if you don't you will have, a little delay
Zip-de-doo-dah, zip-de-day
I'm the S-K the B-I-Z the Emezah-A-R-K
And even if I'm buggin on out, around the way
You'll never see me drinkin Tanqueray
Swan, G. Rap, Kane, Shan and Shante
Always been down with the capital J
I got a homeboy by the name of Dr. Bombay
My favorite color - is GREY!  Uhh

[Outro]
I can't forget I like reggae
I'm Biz Markie, and my DJ
C-double-O-L V to the break of day
Hold up, bricka-bricka-bay
Rockin to the rhythm, to the break of day
The original B-I-Z, the Emeza-Emeza-A
Best to sing, and appointed rap king, to the break of day
Everywhere I go I like break your way
And it don't matter to me, as long I give you a display
Zip-a-dee-do-dah rock the microphone and you say
The king of romance will like break your day
I'm Biz Mark, I'd like to say okay
And my favorite drink is called OJ
Hippin to hop then to break your way
Listen to me as I rock and I, say okay
To my man Rud and Superlover Cee ay
I rock to the rhythm and oh say okay
Can't forget my man, G-A, U-L
Hold up - it don't matter to me I rock swell
Hold up - you know it's, me, the
Original B-I-Z, the Emeza-A-Rrah-K-I-E
The original with the material and the ladies always know
I'm bound to wreck in like a Lincoln, always steal a show
To kick it with swing, to rock the thing, ha-heh-ha-ha-ha-hee
Known to me as the original B
It don't matter long as I say stuff you see
Kickin records of a rap technique and..
.. down to wreck your body, your moms be freakin
To my man Godfather Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-AHHH!



One two, one two
You're listenin to the grand groovin sounds
Of the diabolical energetical B-I-Z
Emmezah-A-Rrrah-K
And this goes out to my DJ
The cutmaster that no one cuts faster than
C-double-oh-L V
Drumroll V

[Verse One]
It's a different kind of sound that's in the air
It's not shots, firecrackers, or a car that's there
A little different noise for your listenin pleasure
A sample from a record that's a four bar measure
Adults think this music is just a big headache
They think all this hard work, is just a piece of cake
They must be buggin, right out of they socks
Why don't they get up and try to do, the human beatbox
Cause back in the days when there was just block parties
A DJ would set up his equipment, and start these
Live performances, and DJ tricks
A lot of different DJ's was on the mix
It is a proven fact, music is a universal language
From the tip of Long Island to the Verrezano Bridge
We won awards and served them by the millions
The more more years go by, the more we be killin 'em
They said it's just a fad, it will never last a year
All of a sudden, ten years later - "I hear music"

[Chorus: Cool V scratches "I hear music in the street" over and over]

Cool V, give me a drum roll

[Verse Two]
I can't believe how hip-hop has progressed
With more and more groups that have finesse
We have groups on the East and West coast with different names
We all play a part if we didn't we'd go in flames
We all got to stick together as one
But at the same time, still have fun
Cause you don't wanna lose the love for the music
When you have it keep it, and make use of it
This is a lesson from the S-K Biz
Cause nobody else is gonna tell you like it is
Everyone thought that rap was just a phase
But it still continue, to muse and amaze
It gives people chance to show they true talents
Instead of submittin to the crime and violence
People said to me the S-K-B
Is rap gonna stay until infinity?
As long as me and V be makin up the beats
You will hear people sayin - "I hear music"

[Chorus]

Cool V, give me a drum roll

[Verse Three]
This is the ending, conclusion, kapiche?
Of this new hip-hop masterpiece
About people countin chickens before they're hatched
Recollatin on somethin that they can't match
They're creatin sounds of a hip-hop human bein
Whether you're American or European
Or even if you're from the West or East coast
I'd like to thank all of you, save the most
Don't diss each other by sayin who's better
Just do it the best way, and stick together
With different rhyme techniques and DJ cuts
And be crazy ambitious, and have a lot of guts
And the people buyin, thanks for your support
Cause if it wasn't for you, we'd all fall short
As long as there's radio, cars and jeeps
You know what you will hear?

[Chorus]

What, what?  What, what what what what?
Yo V, yo yo what what what what what what what you hear?
I can't hear you man, scratch it up one mo' time!
Yo what you hear?
Yo Paul Sea, yo yo, what wha-what you hear?
Yo Godfather D, I ain't hear what he said, what you hear?



Aaaaaahh yeeea
The diabolical is back again
But now I want the Killerforce Connection
And we gonna do it in harmony like this

We're the Killerforce MC's
The best in New York city
So let us put it to perfection
While we change it to the Biz Mark connection
Other crews in this section always try to ban the connection
They got together and they combined
Tried to hurt us from time to time
But it didn't work.. as you see
The Biz Mark is in the place to be
So come on party people, get into the groove because-
Biz Markie is gonna bust the mood

Biz Markie.. hey that's me
You know that I body rock to the T-O-P
And I'm the born sureshot you can't resist
I'm gonna take your girl with my sweet kiss
And he's TJ Swan that's his name
And if you're rockin to the beat, I'm to blame
I got the power to get you up off the wall
And get you on the floor, so you can have a ball
The cut master Cool V
He is the man that's at the top of the key
Of course he is fast you know that he is slick
So many fly girls jumpin on his dick

So let's rooooooooock, until we reach the tooooooop
And we'll never stooooooop, the rhythm must must to roooooock

{*shout outs until the end*}



And yes y'all, yes y'all
This is, a different type of dedication
To my man Marcus from Kansas City
But I'm just tellin ya straight on up
Don't be messin with no drugs
Whether you're young, whether you're old
Whether you're bad, whether you're bold
Don't mess with it cause it's not for the soul
And we gonna do it a little somethin
With three subjects like this..

[Biz Markie]
Subject one is about a brother by the name of John
Who was sellin crack, just like it was Avon
And you know y'know the reason I say "was"
Because that's no longer what my man John does
There was a time when he was wearin much gold
Drivin a Benz, Jaguar and a Rolls
The lifestyle he lived was far from penny ante
Yo-ho-ho-ho-ho, word to granny's panties
Cause he would make dough-roll, and swing it like a yo-yo
Bein broke, was just a no-no
But then the day came when John got caught
And he was dropped like pantyhose without support
You shoulda thought about, what you did in the past
To realize, this fast livin wouldn't last
But, the same guy that was a big hoodlum
Is now in jail, waitin for someone to duke him

[Hook - kids singing 4X]
Things get a little easier
Once you learn to understand it

[Biz Markie]
Subject two, and this one is a doozy
A messed up story about a girl named Suzy
Now when you're on WIC, the problems may seem enough
But you know she had to get Scotty to beam her up
On a crack mission, no type of ambition
Make blunts disappear better than a magician
Her eyes got dim, her body got slim
She said there's nothin in the world like a good ol' stem
On and like on and, and it was strong
Grabbed her pipe and sung a song
"I want to get HIGH.. so high!"
"I want to get HIGH.. so high!"
She'd go out buy a nice rock just to suit her
Then hit the weed spot to be blessed by buddha
Bum offa Lucy to complete her stimulation
Put it all together for a perfect combination
I mean this girl would actually buy a rock with
The very last dime she got in her pocket
And when she saw her friends, comin from the spot
Like Prudential, she got a piece of their rock
That's why

[Hook]

[Biz Markie]
Subject three, finally, the
E-N-D about a girl by the name of Marie
She used to be hot, most beautiful to the utmost
I mean this girl was blessed with an overdose
Of curves, swerves, word to the mother my brother
And boy did the B-I-Z love her
But then.. {*singing*} those.. were.. the.. DAYS
My friend.. we thought they'd never end
And she looked alright, to the S-K Biz Markie
But then she got on drugs
Started wearin extensions and rugs
And let me tell you what say happened to Marie
{*rapping*} because nowadays Marie don't look so hot
Everytime that I see her, she's headed for the spot
Her hair is all knotty, got Scotty got her body
And her underarms kickin like the ho know karate
Her clothes are real dirty, and usually the same
As for money she don't have a dime to claim
Because when I saw the girl the other day
She was puttin a pack of Now-or-Laters on layaway

[Hook] - fades out



[Biz Markie]
This is a different type of dedication
To a guy that was a different kind of inspiration
Only people that knew him, know what I'm talkin about
And at the end of the story, you will say without a doubt
This wasn't your typical case, of fast livin
Anything he was makin, he was givin
To his moms, pops, his brother and his girl
Cause they, meant, the most to him in the world
Around Suffolk he wasn't known
But in Eastern Long Island, he did have a home
Called L.I., is where he stayed
Where there was no need for D-Con or Raid
He was cool with everybody, he had no enemies
I'm makin this record, cause he's a friend of me
Cause he's a hard workin kid, I've just stated
That's why this record, is dedicated
To my man Rich

Yo yo, this is for you my man
God bless you

[Verse Two]
Let me tell you what happened in the early 80's
When we wasn't thinkin about gettin all the ladies
Me and Rich was thinkin about survival of the fittest
You can ask Keith or Kevin, cause both of them were with us
We'd try to get a job everyplace that it takes
We was even at the factory they call {?}
Everywhere we went they said they'd call us back
Or even said they're not hirin to throw us off track
But Richie Rich said, forget that stuff
Even though, times was rough
We kept searchin searchin lookin and lookin
It seems everywhere we went, the jobs was tooken
Still Rich didn't give up the faith
He found a job that wasn't safe
Even though it was dangerous, it wouldn't switch
That's why this is dedicated to my man Rich

Yo this is to you my man Rich
Cause you know you go way back, you go way back
Word up, God bless you

[Verse Three]
The way the story end, is just a tragedy
I wish upon a star that it didn't have to be
Endin this way for my man Richard
Cause still in my mind, he's still as pictured
Like, he just had gone yesterday
For sellin, C-R-A-C-K
His dream was.. to be a boxer
So, he could knock the socks off of
An Ivan Barkley, or even Mike Tyson
But on the streets, he was sacrificin
For his family, and his wife
Cause he struggled, he struggled all his life
He wasn't a straight up, criminal or villain
Or even tryin to get, stupid or illin
Was messed up for takin somebody's life and shit
That tried so hard, and just wouldn't quit
This is a slow record, with a switch
Because it's dedicated, to my man Rich

To you my man
This is to you, Rich
Peace



[Refrain]
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Alle Mädels, alle Jungs sagen „No!“
Deines Lebens wirst du nicht mehr froh
Was weißt denn du von Liebe?
Von Liebe weißt du nichts!
Dich ham deine Gefühle mal wieder ausgetrickst
Du hältst dich für gefährlich
Doch siehst nicht die Gefahr
Das hier ist die Geschichte von Emanuela

[Strophe 1]
Sie ist wie Fieber
Du willst sie wieder
Das geht viel tiefer
Als alles and’re jemals zuvor
Eben wars noch kochend heiß
Und auf einmal wird es kalt wie Trockeneis
Sie ist unglaublich
Sie macht dich traurig
Dein Style hilft auch nicht
Hau ab, sonst hast du alles verloren!
Alter, bitte glaube uns:
Wie dir ging es hier schon tausend Jungs!

[Refrain]
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Alle Mädels, alle Jungs sagen „No!“
Deines Lebens wirst du nicht mehr froh
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Alle Mädels, alle Jungs sagen „No!“
Deines Lebens wirst du nicht mehr froh

[Refrain]
Jetzt sitzt du draußen auf der Treppe
Vor ihrem Haus, du kleiner Gangster!
Lässig rauchst du Zigarette
Und wirfst Steine an ihr Fenster
Als du sie gesehen hast
War hier im Viertel Straßenfest
Es war ihr Anblick, der dich
Seither keine Nacht mehr schlafen lässt

[Bridge]
Emanuela!
Emanuela!
Emanuela!
What goes on?
Kannst du dir das bitte mal vorstellen?
Emanuela!

[Refrain]
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Alle Mädels, alle Jungs sagen „No!“
Deines Lebens wirst du nicht mehr froh

[Strophe 3]
Ein, zwei, drei Monate nur zu Haus
Eine Nacht und du gehst mal wieder aus
Ein Fehler, wer steht da?
Emanuela!
Noch bevor es mit euch beiden angefangen hat
Macht sie Schluss
Und eure einzige Berührung bleibt ein kurzer Abschiedskuss

[Bridge]
Er betet und hofft, dass sie ihn erhört
Er betet und hofft, dass sie ihn erhört
Er betet und hofft, dass sie ihn erhört

[Strophe 4]
Was weißt denn du von Liebe?
Von Liebe weißt du nichts!
Dich ham deine Gefühle mal wieder ausgetrickst
Du hältst dich für gefährlich
Doch siehst nicht die Gefahr
Das hier ist die Geschichte von Emanuela

[Refrain]
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Alle Mädels, alle Jungs sagen „No!“
Deines Lebens wirst du nicht mehr froh
Emanuela!




[Strophe I:]
Was, du willst heute nicht kommen? Erzähl davon später bloß nichts deinen kindern
Die fassen sich nämlich an den kopf und fragen ist papa denn echt so'n blinder?
Da ging's ab, alle wussten davon und erzähln, was das für'n hammer war
Die haben wieder 'ne nacht zur legende gemacht und mit wem war eigentlich mama da?
Ja, ihr habt richtig gehört, freunde, der absolute wahnsinn
Fettes brot ist zurück und die neue cd steht ab jetzt im laden
Denn die cleversten jungs sind immer noch boris, björn und martin
Und anstatt hohler phrasen hagelt es gold und platin
Que sera sera oder was läuft bei euch im cd-player
Warte besser nicht bis nächstes jahr
Sondern komm' auf die tour und dann stehste da
Wir wollen bitte sehr, ist das schwer zu verstehn, immer mehr arme sehn
Bis weit hinterm mischer
Hands in the air like you just don't care
Werft sie hin und her wie scheibenwischer

[Chorus:]
Wir sehn gut aus wie immer, ihr seht gut aus wie immer
Wohin man guckt nur coole macker, heiße frauenzimmer
Alles genau wie immer
Und es ist jedem hier klar, das wird niemals aufhörn
Ihr seid im haus, wie immer. Wir sind im haus, wie immer
Und heute abend brennt die luft, dass euch die augen flimmern
Alles genau wie immer
Und es ist jedem hier klar, dass wir jedes haus burnen

[Strophe II:]
Seit dieses lied läuft, hast du nicht einmal geatmet
Weil du auf diese platte jetzt schon echt seit drei jahren wartest
Und anstatt sie zu kopiern gibst du uns all dein erspartes
Wir wollen uns bei dir bedanken, dass du hier heute am start bist
Sympathisch! Mein lieber herr gesangsverein
Ich kann nicht aufhörn euch anzuschrein
Hab mich so gefreut auf euch, wenn es sein muss, tanz ich ganz allein
Bei all dem andern müll der häufig läuft, will ich nur das neueste teufelszeug
Wegen euch hab ich angefangen zu reimen, wehe das enttäuscht mich heut
Hoffentlich muss ich nicht warten, hoffentlich gibt es noch karten
Hoffentlich gibt's beim merchandise shirts und eins von den plakaten
Kann ich mich nach vorn stellen? Hoffentlich holen sie die ollen kamellen
Aus der schublade, und spieln – das wär noch cooler, ne – ihre superhits als zugabe

[Chorus]

[Strophe III:]
Weißt du das ist nun mal so, so was wie hier findst du nicht im Fundbüro
Und auch nicht aufm Karstadt-Kundenklo
Hundert Pro das findst du nur bei unserer Show
Macht mal Lärm für die Mutter aller Partybands
Mindestens so fröhlich wie die Cardigans
Ich würde gerne wissen was du gerade denkst
Ob du weißt wo du heut Abend pennst
Und morgen deine Arbeit schwänzt

[Bridge:][x2]
Schick sofort eine Message an all deine Freunde und sag ihnen, sie Müssen noch kommen
Und versicher' ihnen glaubhaft am Telefon du hättest keinerlei Drogen genommen

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Auch als die party schon lange vorbei war, waren alle noch stundenlang da
Sie kannten sich nicht, doch sie tranken zusammen und sie fühlten sich ganz wunderbar
Von dem was heute passiert ist redet man noch in ein paar hundert jahren
Menschen haben sich verliebt, und kinder gemacht und sie gaben ihnen dann unsere namen (klar) [x2]



[Strophe I:]
Sie weiß nicht mehr, wie lange das schon geht
Doch für sie fühlt es sich an als wäre es ewig
Sie und ihr kind und die zwei verdammten jobs
Zum sterben zu viel und zum leben zu wenig
Doch sie macht weiter
Weil sie weitermachen muss
Keine alternative
Es gibt so viel, was auf der strecke bleibt
Ihr glück und die lust und vor allem die liebe
Nach 'nem harten arbeitstag
Keiner da der ihr sagt, dass er sie mag
Und der kleine hat auf diese art
Wieder mal nach seinem vater gefragt
Ich will, dass du endlich einsiehst
Und ich meine es wie ich's sage
Seit du drei bist stecken wir hier in diesem scheißdreck
Weil der feigling uns allein lässt
Er wird nicht wiederkommen, bitte sprich nicht mehr davon
Aber glaub mir wir schaffen das schon

[Chorus:]
Immer wenn die Nacht anbricht
Immer wenn sie wach da liegt, fragt sie sich
Soll das alles sein? Soll das alles sein, alles sein?
Immer wenn der Tag anbricht
Immer wenn sie wach da liegt, fragt sie sich
Soll das alles sein? Soll das alles sein, alles sein?

[Strophe II:]
Tagsüber ist sie kellnerin, abends wird noch geputzt
Und gestern ist ihr im streit mit ihrem sohn die hand ausgerutscht
Und es tut ihr leid, sie weiß bescheid
Eigentlich macht sie sowas nicht
Doch sie kann den traurigen blick nicht ertragen
Wenn sie ihn mal wieder zu oma schickt
Sie will nur dass es läuft für ihn
Sie will dass er mal chancen hat
Denn sie hat echt die jobs so satt
Aus dem scheiß-annoncenblatt
Bitte entschuldige, dass ich so selten da bin
Nicht helfen kann bei deinen hausaufgaben
Ich schaff's auch wieder nicht zum elternabend
Und du weißt ja auch, wie wenig geld wir haben
Ich hoffe du weißt, wenn ich könnte, dann würde ich gerne mehr zeit mit dir verbringen
Aber mehr ist im moment leider nicht drin

[Chorus]

[Strophe III:]
Nach einer nacht ohne schlaf
Sieht sie alles sonderbar klar
Streicht ihrem sohn nochmal durch's haar
Erinnert sich dran, wie es ohne ihn war
Dann steht sie auf, schaut auf die uhr
Nimmt ihren mantel vom haken im flur
Öffnet das schloss, geht aus der tür
Wie an jedem tag, doch sie weiß jetzt wofür
Und egal was alle sagen, es geht an mir vorbei
Egal was sie erwarten, es geht um uns zwei
Wenn's nicht immer leicht ist dann soll es so sein
Auch wenn der weg weit ist, ich geh nicht allein

[Chorus][x3]



[Doktor Renz:]
Dies hier ist ein Lied über die meisten meiner Feinde
Und davon gab es einige in unserer kleinen Gemeinde
Alles so Typen bei denen ich nicht grade beliebt war
Ganz besonders der eine hatte mich auf dem Kieker
Ich versuchte stets dem Problem aus dem Weg zu gehn
Aber diesmal hatte ich ihn wohl zu spät gesehn
Es dauert ne Weile bis ich das begreife
Zack gab’s eine astreine Backpfeife
Ach Scheisse! Ich nahm die Beine in die Hand
Bin den halben Heimweg gerannt
Jetzt bloß nicht zu weinen anfangen
Bis er auf einmal wieder vor mir stand
Mein Feind und ich im strömenden Regen
In irgendeinem schöneren Leben hätt’ es hier eine Versöhnung gegeben
Aber deinen Namen den vergess’ ich nie
Mike du weißt schon wie!

Es ist 1989 Rap rettete mich
Und endlich hatte ich das Gefühl die Zeiten besserten sich
De La Soul waren in der Stadt und noch lächelte ich
Doch gerade deshalb hätte ich nach der Show fast in die Fresse gekriegt
Da waren sie wieder die meisten meiner Feinde
Nur diesmal war ich Gott sei dank nicht alleine
Wir sind die Poetz of Peeze
Unser Flow is noch mies
Aber die Hosen hängen tief wie bei den grossen MCs
Ey yo, ich hatte meine eigene Hip Hop Band
Wir rockten jede Jam wie die Bekloppten
Dabei immer fleissig auf der Suche nach Gleichgesinnten
Die standen meistens weiter hinten
Warn gar nicht so leicht zu finden
Leider war nämlich Grinsen verboten
Und wir waren nur dämliche Provinzidioten
Zu dieser Zeit dachte ich oft an meinen ersten Feind

Not enough MCs, too many Mikes
Too many Mics

Aus Poetz wurde Fettes und aus Peeze wurde Brot
Klar ist der Name bescheuert aber wir liessen ihn so
Denn alles ging jetzt ziemlich schnell
Und zwar nach oben wie jeder weiss
Der vielleicht tollste Job der Welt
Im sympathischen Kollegenkreis
Ich kann tun was mir gefällt und krieg dafür auch noch Geld
Ist ja eigentlich ganz egal, was n andrer davon hält
Ey Martin, da disst dich, irgend so ein Superarsch
Sag mal das ist ja - genau!
Der Co-Rapper von Walkin' Large!
Der hat mir auf Tour doch noch sein Demo vorgespielt
Von dem ich nur im Ohr behielt
Dass alle seinen Schwanz lutschen sollen
Na ja, ich fands nich so doll, jetzt ist er wohl beleidigt
Nimmt den Mund ganz schön voll, das stinkt mir echt gewaltig
Ich hatte Rachephantasien für die ich Gefängnis verdien
Aber Dicker - ich hab dir längst verziehn

Die meisten meiner Feinde könnten meine Freunde sein
Nur die meisten meiner Feinde halten nix von solchen Träumereien

Alle sind der Meinung eigentlich ist es Wahnsinn Lieder wie diese rauszubringen
Alter jetzt bist du dran früher war vieles Spaß heute nehmen ’s viele Ernst
Frage mich wo soll das enden wir glaubten so stark an die Hip Hop Kultur
Ohne Hass, ohne Stress, ohne Schlägereien, sag Bo, Bo falls du weisst was ich mein

Die meisten meiner Feinde sitzen Montagabend alle bei Beckmann
Mike, Kuddel und die andern alle heftig am lästern
Sie sagen dass ich überhaupt nicht rappen kann
Und Reinhold bietet seinen Gästen Sekt an
Ich werd wieder wach und seh mein wahres Problem
Dass die ganzen Typen da mich gar nicht erwähn
Bin nicht mal mehr in der Liste der wackesten zehn
Doch ich bemerke wie ich mich danach sehn
Alle dissen sich jetzt öffentlich mit Morddrohungen auf MTV
Und wird der erste Rapper erschossen bin ich mir sicher das senden die
Live aus Berlin die Beerdigung im Hip Hop Mausoleum
Und rechtzeitig zu Weihnachten dann die fette Auferstehung
Die meisten meiner Feinde machen sich kalt, werden abgeknallt
Alle Rapper links und rechts von mir explodieren
Doch stirbt die ganze Konkurrenz heisst das in letzter Konsequenz
übrig bleibt nur einer und zwar haha ich wills nicht sagen, Kuddel
Sing es für mich
Dokter Renz Dokter Renz


Hätte jemand über mich sowas gesagt was ich über ihn gesagt hab so weisst du dann hätt ich genauso reagiert
Folg RapGeniusDeutschland!



[Strophe I:]
Yasmin, aus heutiger perspektive
Bist du wohl so etwas wie meine erste liebe
Nicht einfach nur süß eher etwas mysteriös
Und hast du mich gegrüßt wurd ich stets 'n bisschen nervös
Wir sahen dich auf'm raucherhof mit deinen älteren freunden
Die sich über deine witze totlachten
Während wir die gelegenheit selten versäumten dich zu beobachten
Dann kamst du in unsere klasse und wurdest die heldin der neunten
Denn als der rest geschwiegen hatte
Saßt du da in deiner olivgrünen bomberjacke
Und gabst du ihm kontra, dem monster in mathe
Und seiner konservativen kacke
Yasmin, weißt du noch der eine sommertag
Alle waren baden im baggersee, dann gab's n donnerschlag
Doch als ich schnell nach hause wollte, fehlte mein hollandrad
Ein diebstahl wie gold so kostbar
So stolz wie oskar saß ich auf deinem gepäckträger
Und in dich war jeder verliebt, ich meine echt jeder

[Chorus:]
Yasmin aus hausnummer 16a
Kommt mir vor als ob es gestern war (where you been?)
Schade dass man dich in dieser gegend hier nicht mehr sieht
Yasmin heute sage ich dir zum ersten mal
Was mir immer schon am herzen lag (i like to tell you things some brothers don't)
Hast du nie gemerkt, von uns war jeder in dich verliebt

[Strophe II:]
Yasmin, als du in unsere klasse kamst hat das mein herz erweicht
Du warst so wunderschön und du rochst nach erdbeereis
Leider dachtest du, ich hätte das als scherz gemeint
Dabei wollte ich liebe, sex und zärtlichkeit
Yasmin, nach dir waren alle jungs der klasse verrückt
Keine frage mann, du warst echt der superstar
Und eines tages dann traf sich zum ersten mal unser blick
Und ich habe mich gefragt ob das wohl zufall war
Du warst die einzige die wein oder kippen kriegt
Ich wurde * * * bei deinem rosa lippenstift
Egal was war, du bist immer so cool geblieben
Und ich habe deinen namen aufs schulklo geschrieben
„yasmin, du bist die queen“, hab ich geschrieben
Denn mehr wörter hatte ich nicht
Yasmin, bei dir wurden sogar die knie vom lehrkörper tatterig
Für dich war ich zum ersten mal völlig breit
Das tat mir dann zwei tage lang höllisch leid
Für dich hab ich zum ersten mal zwei kurze geklaut
Und deinetwegen hab ich auch meinen durchschnitt versaut
Doch das war mir egal, denn ich hatte dich lieb
Für dich blieb ich sogar bei physik und mathematik
Und dein foto das hing an der wand
Yasmin, an dir hätt ich mir gern die finger verbrannt

[Chorus]

[Strophe III:]
Erinnerst du dich an die klassenreise st. Peter
Du hattest damals massenweise verehrer
Yasmin, ich war einer von ihnen
Wollte in deiner nähe sein
Schlich nachts über den gang im ferienheim
Ich hatte es auf dich abgesehen, das schwör ich
Du hast mich selten eines blickes gewürdigt
Dann am letzten abend die engtanzparty
Wir waren uns nie so nahe wie bei terence trent d'arby
„wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell“
Nur das ende kam 'n bisschen zu schnell
War das nun wunschdenken oder zu viel küstennebel
Yasmin, darf ich dir ein tape aufnehmen
Mit songs da wird dir das herz aufgehen
Ich bin mir fast sicher, du wirst drauf stehn
Und so saß ich blödian vorm kassettenrecorder
Vom eigenen größenwahn so komplett überfordert
Ganz egal was ich niederschrieb
Nichts war so schön wie das tape als mein liebesbrief
Ob eine wie du es versteht wenn ein song dir etwas verrät?
Dich zu fragen wär' ein bisschen zu spät, ich glaube du mochtest damals das tape

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
(I came to let you know fantasies burn like desires)



[Intro:]
Aufgewacht! Hier kommt Lauterbach!

[Chorus:]
Lauter lauter lauter Lauterbach[x3]
(Schrei doch zurück, wenn du dich für lauter hältst!)
Lauter lauter lauter Lauterbach[x3]
(Everybody's screaming louder!)

[Strophe I:]
Du hast dein leben lang gelernt, nicht zu laut zu sein
Dich einzureihen und nicht aufzufallen
Jetzt ist es an der zeit sich mal aufzubäumen
Draufzuhauen und die scheiße endlich rauszuschreien
Also mach platz, bitte aus dem weg mann
Wir reißen das maul auf bevor wir überlegt haben
Wir springen euch mit dem nackten arsch ins gesicht
Ihr sagt „vielen dank!“ ich sag „ach dafür nich'!“
Dann hör ich euch wieder jammern, dass das kein verhalten wär'
Uns egal mann ihr könnt eure ratschläge behalten, yeah

[Chorus]

[Strophe II:]
Ihr stellt euch hinten an, wir drängeln uns vor
Wir schreien durcheinander, ihr wie engel im chor
Wir gehen einfach weiter, auch wenn da stopp steht
Wer ist das wohl, der am lautstärkeknopf dreht
Also hebt eure hände in die luft, wenn ihr wollt dass ich hier diesen spinner rauswerfe
Denn er meint ja genug sei genug und ab 22 uhr nur noch zimmerlautstärke
Wo bitte sehr kommen die vorschriften her unser ganzes leben lang
Damit ist schluss. Hör jetzt auf! Wir gehn ab, du gehst raus, heut' ist tanz auf dem vulkan

[Chorus]

[Strophe III:]
Und er hört nie auf der krach
König boris lauterbach
Keiner kann hier heute einfach leise entkommen
Wir haben euch allesamt als geiseln genommen
Sogar von weitem ist die party schon bei nacht zu erkennen denn
Alles steht in flammen und wir lassen es brennen
Wir wollen rabatz saufen schnaps und zwar kalt und klar
Hände hoch was geht ab hamburg altona!

[Chorus]



[Intro: Björn Beton]
Yeayeayea ich bin's Björn Beton
Zusammen mit Sebi und Jansen
Vielleicht wollen die Ladies tanzen

[Part 1: Björn Beton]
Ich hatte Dich gefragt was wünschst Du Dir zum Geburtstag
Worauf Du mir gestern sagtest
Du hast nur einen Wunsch, wenn Du diese Welt betrachtest
Dass sie besser wird, das wäre echt fantastisch
Das schenk ich dir, sogar etwas Selbstgemachtes
Mmh nun sieht es aber so aus
Dass man für Gerechtigkeit kein Gelaber mehr braucht
Wir machen 'ne Revolution, wie auf Kuba, hier
Ich regel das schon, da sagtest Du zu mir

[Bridge 1: Alexandra Prince]
Du bist nicht Che Guevara, Berlin ist nicht Havana
Und der Ku'damm nicht der Malecon

[Hook: Alexandra Prince]
Das ist doch hier nicht Kuba, Björn Beton
Aber super wär' das schon
Würd' das gehen stürzt das System bei der Revolution
Das ist doch hier nicht Kuba, Björn Beton
Aber super wär' das schon
Würd' das gehen stürzt das System bei der Revolution

[Part 2: Björn Beton]
Ich begann zu ahnen, ich brauch 'n Plan
Mit Bäume pflanzen wär' das nicht getan
Die Leute müssten einfach eines verstehn:
Unser kleines Problem ist dieses Schweinesystem
Das sagte ich Passanten
So entstanden gleich erste Sympathisanten im Bekanntenkreis
Ich glaub vom Asylanten bis Fabrikanten
Weiß bald jeder es schon (viva la revolucion!)
Auf Handzetteln in Fußgängerzonen
Auf Plakaten in Großbuchstaben
Hatte ich geschrieben: Ihr seid eingeladen
Am Freitagabend, bitte weitersagen!
Treffpunkt ist der Ku'damm (che?)
Wenn die Revolte was für Dich ist
Dann kommst Du besser mit der U-Bahn
Bleiben wir realistisch und fordern das Unmögliche
Sei kein Buhmann, hört sich das nicht gut an?

[Bridge 2: Alexandra Prince]
Du bist nicht Hannes Wader
Was Du singst ist nur Gelaber
Warum machst du keinen Partysong?

[Hook: Alexandra Prince]
Das ist doch hier nicht Kuba, Björn Beton
Aber super wär' das schon
Würd' das gehen stürzt das System bei der Revolution
Das ist doch hier nicht Kuba, Björn Beton
Aber super wär' das schon
Würd' das gehen stürzt das System bei der Revolution

[Part 3: Björn Beton]
Wenn alle Leute kommen, die dieses Land verändern wollen
Haben wir doch schon gewonnen
Ich glaub daran so viele träumen davon
Dann folgt Björn Beton in die Einkaufsmeile
Da steh ich nämlich schon seit 'ner Weile
Warte, dass jemand kommt aber bleib alleine
Überraschenderweise stehst Du plötzlich vor mir und sagst ganz leise

[Bridge 3: Alexandra Prince]
Das ist doch nicht so'n Drama
Wir üben das ein paar mal
Eines schönen Tages klappt das schon

[Hook: Alexandra Prince]
Das ist doch hier nicht Kuba, Björn Beton
Aber super wär' das schon
Würd' das gehen stürzt das System bei der Revolution
Das ist doch hier nicht Kuba, Björn Beton
Aber super wär' das schon
Würd' das gehen stürzt das System bei der Revolution

[Outro]
Yea, das nenn ich Klassenkampf
Wie Du nennst mich Klassenclown?
Liebling, lass uns Waffen klaun
Dacht ich mirs doch, ich brauch 'ne Knarre
'ne Kalaschnikow
Und ne Zigarre
Ach was solls
Erzähl von dem Fiasko bloss nichts Fidel Castro
Lass uns gehn
Sag mal meinst du mir steht eigentlich ne Baskenmütze?
Also ich denke schon
Haben wir eigentlich noch Rum zuhause?
Ich hab so'n Bock auf Kuba libre



[1. Strophe: Doc Renz]
Moin, moin! Was geht?
Alles klar bei dir? Wie spät?
Gleich neun - okay!
Will mal eben los, Frühstück holen geh'n
Schalt den Walkman an, zieh' die Haustür ran
Lauf die Straße entlang bis zum Kaufmannsladen
Denn da gibt's die allerbesten Brötchen weit und breit
Kann am Tresen kurz mal lesen, was die Zeitung schreibt
Irgendwas von 'nem Großangriff, unzählige Bomben auf kleine Stadt
Viele Menschen ums Leben gekommen und dem Erdboden gleich gemacht
In nur einer Nacht
Ich zahl' und verlasse den Bäcker, hör' noch den Nachrichtensprecher
"Lage noch mal dramatisch verschlechtert, heute fantastisches Wetter!"
Plötzlich gibt's 'n Knall, tausend Scherben überall
Die Nachbarskatze hat's erwischt bei 'nem Verkehrsunfall
Der Anblick kann einem echt die Laune verderben
Was fällt diesem Mistvieh ein, hier genau vor meinen Augen zu sterben?

[Hook: Finkenauer]
Absolute Wahnsinnsshow
Im Fernseh'n und im Radio
Die Sonne lacht so schadenfroh
An Tagen wie diesen
Niemand, der mir sagt wieso
Beim Frühstück oder Abendbrot
Die Fragen bohr'n so gnadenlos
An Tagen wie diesen

[2. Strophe: König Boris]
Eine Million bedroht vom Hungertod nach Schätzungen der UNICEF
Während ich grad gesundes Obst zerhäcksel' in der Moulinex
Seh' ein Kind in dessen traurigen Augen 'ne Fliege sitzt
Weiß, dass das echt grausam ist, doch Scheiße Mann, ich fühle nix!
Was ist denn bloß los mit mir, verdammt wie ist das möglich?
Vielleicht hab ich's schon zu oft gesehen, man sieht's ja beinah' täglich
Doch warum kann mich mittlerweile nicht mal das mehr erschrecken
Wenn irgendwo Menschen an dreckigem Wasser verrecken?
Dieses dumpfe Gefühl, diese Leere im Kopf
Sowas kann uns nie passieren und was wäre, wenn doch?
Und mich zerreißen die Fragen, ich kann den Scheiß nich' ertragen
Die haben da nix mehr zu Fressen und ich hab Steine im Magen!

[Hook: Finkenauer]
Absolute Wahnsinnsshow
Im Fernseh'n und im Radio
Die Sonne lacht so schadenfroh
An Tagen wie diesen
Niemand, der mir sagt wieso
Beim Frühstück oder Abendbrot
Die Fragen bohr'n so gnadenlos
An Tagen wie diesen

[3. Strophe: Schiffmeister]
Was hat er grade gesagt? An so 'nem normalen Samstag
Passiert auf bestialische Art ein ganz brutaler Anschlag?!
Bei dem sechs Leute starben, die Verletzten schrei'n Namen
Diese entsetzlichen Taten lassen mich jetzt nicht mehr schlafen
Und ich seh's noch genau, das Bild im TV
Ein junger Mann steht dort im Staub, fleht um Kind und Frau
Jetzt frag ich mich: Wie ist es wohl wenn man sein Kind verliert
Noch bevor es seinen ersten Geburtstag hat?
Doch das übersteigt meine Vorstellungskraft
Vielleicht war'n die Attentäter voller Hass für den Gegner
Vielleicht gab es Liebe für Familie und sie war'n sogar selber Väter
Manchmal, wenn ich Nachrichten seh', passiert mit mir etwas Seltsames
Denn auch wir sind Eltern jetzt, haben ein Kind in diese Welt gesetzt
Dann kommt es vor, dass ich Angst davor krieg, dass uns etwas geschieht
Dass man den verliert, den man liebt, dass es das wirklich gibt
Mitten in der Nacht werd' ich wach und bin schweißgebadet
Schleich' ans Bett meiner Tochter und hör', wie sie ganz leise atmet

[Hook: Finkenauer]
Absolute Wahnsinnsshow
Im Fernseh'n und im Radio
Die Sonne lacht so schadenfroh
An Tagen wie diesen
Niemand, der mir sagt wieso
Beim Frühstück oder Abendbrot
Die Fragen bohr'n so gnadenlos
An Tagen wie diesen

[Outro: Finkenauer]
Was für 'ne Wahnsinnsshow
Im Fernseh'n und im Radio
Die Sonne lacht dabei so schadenfroh
Ich werd die Bilder nicht mehr los
Beim Frühstück und beim Abendbrot
Niemand, der mir sagen kann wieso



[Strophe I:]
Kommt zusammen, familienfotos!
Einmal lächeln bitte klick
2005 hamburg hessen glaub dran
Hallo!
Fettes brot
So verschrien doch so geliebt
Und euer freund j-luv alias julian williams
Flieg los baby

Ey chica ey
Ey chica bonita!
Ich steh jetzt seit jahren auf der bühne kicke styles
Und mach scherze vor jubelnden mengen
Dir sind meine witze meistens einfach nur peinlich
Drehst dich weg und tust so als würdst du mich nicht kennen
Oder das hier wirklich ich check 's nicht
Wenn du nicht schlafen kannst und du weckst mich
Ist ja im grunde genommen wirklich alles ok
Nur nicht wenn 's samstagmorgen um sechs ist
Du t ohne mittagsschlaf schwer zu ertragen
Schlechte laune und nervige fragen
Warum 's so ist das ist sehr schwer zu sagen
Doch ich wollte dich wirklich gerne mal fragen
Denn baby du machst dinge die ich nicht kapier
Zum bespiel sagtest du gestern zu mir
"guck mal da drüben die blonde im auto
Die passt doch wirklich viel besser zu dir!"
Vieles was mir wichtig ist für dich nebensache
Doch ist dir kalt komm her baby ich geb' dir meine trainingsjacke


[Chorus :]
Glaub mir das ich sag es euch
Verlieb mich jeden tag aufs neue
In dich und deine marotten
Baby was für'n abenteuer
Auch wenn's gerade mal nicht läuft
Und uns kann keiner mehr stoppen

[Strophe II:]
Mann oh mann oh mann solange sind wir schon zusammen
Und wissen ganz genau wie wir einander auf die palme bringen
Am anfang geht es nur um ne ganz kleine sache
Im nächsten augenblick geht es sofort ans eingemachte
Mucksmäuschenstill dann wieder fuchsteufelswild
Du sagst dass dich meine instrumentals nerven
Eines tages wirst du meinen sampler aus dem fenster werfen
Nicht wahr mein schatz, wir kriegen das hin
Ich glaub daran ganz tief in mir drin
Und es hält vielleicht für immer
Von mir aus hol dir ruhig deinen ketchup zum candlelight dinner
Trotz hunderttausend kleinen reibereien
Möcht ich nichts lieber als einfach nur bei dir sein
Denn ich find dich entzückend jedes mal wenn du sagst
Dass du den herbst lieber als den sommer magst
Dat du mien leevsten büst, dat du wohl weisst
Dat du mien leevsten büst
Kumm bi de nacht, kumm bi de nacht

[Chorus]

[Strophe III:]
Dass ich dich hab weiss ich zu schätzen
Keine angst ich werd schon nichts verpetzen
Stell nur gerade wieder fest mit entsetzen
Ich habe über die jahre die besten marotten fast schon vergessen
Warte mal, ich weiss doch was rate mal
Ich starte mal mit nem paradefall
Abends seh' ich deine socken auf dem sofa liegen
Aber wo ist meine schokolade bloß geblieben
Du fährst rückwärts zu schnell aus der ausfahrt
Verbringst deine freizeit im baumarkt
Mich verwirrt deine seltsame art
Du trinkst beim essen nichts, doch n kasten selter am tag
Wenn es nach dir ging gäb es ständig spaghetti
Und das genau ist der punkt
Wie sagte harry zu sally
"du t nicht kompliziert sondern eine herausforderung!"
Und treibst du mich auch manches mal in den wahnsinn
Wenn du dort auf mich wartest will ich genau da hin

[Chorus]

[Strophe IV:]
Ich weiß nicht wie ich's sagen soll
Ich weiss nur du t wundervoll
Ich weiß nicht wie ich's sagen soll
Genauso wie ich's haben wollte

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Glaub daran na
Na na na na na



[Refrain]
Wir hörn die falschen Songs und haben auch die falschen Freunde
Wir gehen in die falschen Clubs uns mögen nur die falschen Leute
Die falsche Meinung
Die falsche Kleidung
Falsche Entscheidung
Da scheissen wir drauf scheissen wir drauf scheissen wir drauf

[König Boris]
Alles begann damals im Kreissaal
Ich kam zur Welt ohne ein’ Lifestyle
Das ist im Nachhineinein großer Scheiß weil
Ohne den Style gibt es leider keinen Beifall
Mir war das ganze damals ziemlich egal
Hab mich erstmal umgedreht noch ’ne Runde gepennt
Tja, hätt’ ich wirklich nicht machen sollen
Denn seitdem verpasse ich zu hundert Prozent jedes coole Event

[Björn Beton]
Wieso das so ist das weiß hier keiner so genau
Früher dachte ich oft ich wäre auf ’ner Modenschau
Wollt so sein wie die, damals hielt ich das für schlau
Klappt natürlich nie, doch ich wünschte mir GV
Ich war sexuell chronisch unterfordert
Hielt Fußball für ne komische Sportart
Bekam ich dafür einen Platzverweis
Hat ich dann verstanden was Abseits heißt

[Dokter Renz]
Die coolen Typen aus der Nachbarschaft gründen ’ne Band
E-Gitarre, Bass und Schlagzeug
Da mach ich mit, doch vorher lern’ ich erst ’n Instrument?
Denn ich weiß genau das passt zu euch
Und dann würde sich der Quatsch hier lohnen
Die Tonleiter immer weiter Mann das packst du schon
Laut aber harmlos wie Platzpatronen
Blas’ ich mutterseelenalone in mein’ Saxophon

[Refrain]

[Björn Beton]
Auf Parties hörte ich immer Walkman
Weil die Leute um mich rum meinen Musikgeschmack nicht mochten

[König Boris]
Ich war nie auf Raves, auf Jams oder im Wellnessclub
Fall überall komisch auf mit meinem Elvis-Look

[Dokter Renz]
Alles was ich wollte (wollte) waren nackte Frauen
Eine feste Freundin um ihr T-Shirt hochzuheben
Alles was ich fand war das nackte Grauen
Eine feste Klammer vom Kieferorthopäden

[König Boris]
Ich war jedesmal der Mega Star
In meinen neuen Sachen von C&A

[Dokter Renz]
Ich hatte keine Gang und keine Crew
Kein Amusement und kein Rendezvous

[Björn Beton]
Ich wär so gern in Bars mit Fernsehstars
Schlürfe Schampus auf ner Vernisage
Das perlt im Glas was ’n derber Spaß!
Morgen wollen alle wissen: Björn wie war’s?!

[Refrain]

[Dokter Renz]
Früher war ich uncool weil ich Hip Hopper war
Später war ich dann ein uncooler Hip Hopper

[König Boris]
Jaja wär das Leben nicht schön wenn ich son geiler Typ wär
Mit allem drum und dran in Designer Streetwear

[Björn Beton]
Da geht leider nix, kann nicht so tun als ob
Es ist wie es ist, gewinn keinen Blumenpott


Wir kommen aus Halstenbek, Pinneberg und Schenefeld
Das war leider nie der Mittelpunkt der Szenewelt

Alle Mauerblümchen [rock rock on]
Alle grauen Mäuschen [rock rock on]
Alle Streberleichen [rock rock on]
Alle Pickelfressen [rock rock on]
Alle hässlichen Entlein [rock rock on]
Alle Linkshänder [rock rock on]
Alle Bettnässer [rock rock on]
Und dicke Mädchen [rock rock on]
Muttersöhnchen [rock rock on]
Spargeltarzan [rock rock on]
Bohnenstangen [rock rock on]
Mäusemelker [rock rock on]
Brillenschlangen [rock rock on]
Sitzenbleiber [rock rock on]
Alle Angsthasen yeah [rock rock on]
Und alle Schreckschrauben uuh [rock rock on]

[Refrain]



[Hook]
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Alle Mädels, alle Jungs sagen „No!“
Deines Lebens wirst du nicht mehr froh
Was weißt denn du von Liebe?
Von Liebe weißt du nichts!
Dich ham deine Gefühle mal wieder ausgetrickst
Du hältst dich für gefährlich
Doch siehst nicht die Gefahr
Das hier ist die Geschichte von Emanuela

[Strophe 1]
Sie ist wie Fieber
Du willst sie wieder
Das geht viel tiefer
Als alles and’re jemals zuvor
Eben wars noch kochend heiß
Und auf einmal wird es kalt wie Trockeneis
Sie ist unglaublich
Sie macht dich traurig
Dein Style hilft auch nicht
Hau ab, sonst hast du alles verloren!
Alter, bitte glaube uns:
Wie dir ging es hier schon tausend Jungs!

[Hook]
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Alle Mädels, alle Jungs sagen „No!“
Deines Lebens wirst du nicht mehr froh
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Alle Mädels, alle Jungs sagen „No!“
Deines Lebens wirst du nicht mehr froh

[Hook]
Jetzt sitzt du draußen auf der Treppe
Vor ihrem Haus, du kleiner Gangster!
Lässig rauchst du Zigarette
Und wirfst Steine an ihr Fenster
Als du sie gesehen hast
War hier im Viertel Straßenfest
Es war ihr Anblick, der dich
Seither keine Nacht mehr schlafen lässt

[Bridge]
Emanuela!
Emanuela!
Emanuela!
What goes on?
Kannst du dir das bitte mal vorstellen?
Emanuela!

[Hook]
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Alle Mädels, alle Jungs sagen „No!“
Deines Lebens wirst du nicht mehr froh

[Strophe 3]
Ein, zwei, drei Monate nur zu Haus
Eine Nacht und du gehst mal wieder aus
Ein Fehler, wer steht da?
Emanuela!
Noch bevor es mit euch beiden angefangen hat
Macht sie Schluss
Und eure einzige Berührung bleibt ein kurzer Abschiedskuss

[Bridge]
Er betet und hofft, dass sie ihn erhört
Er betet und hofft, dass sie ihn erhört
Er betet und hofft, dass sie ihn erhört

[Strophe 4]
Was weißt denn du von Liebe?
Von Liebe weißt du nichts!
Dich ham deine Gefühle mal wieder ausgetrickst
Du hältst dich für gefährlich
Doch siehst nicht die Gefahr
Das hier ist die Geschichte von Emanuela

[Hook]
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Lass die Finger von Emanuela!
Alle Mädels, alle Jungs sagen „No!“
Deines Lebens wirst du nicht mehr froh
Emanuela!




[Intro: DJ Drama]
Ahem
I'd like for you to take this time
And remember where you was
The first time you heard Dedication
If I asked you how many times you've listened to D2
Could you tell me?
Dedication 3 was the first mixtape you heard
When we had a black president
D4 and 5, we got back to business
Y'all done copied the rhymes
Y'all done stole the artwork
Tried to emulate my shit-talkin'
Weezy and Dram' — we are the Mixtape Blueprint
Hahaha! You welcome
A Dedication

[Verse 1: Wayne]
I got Doja, Narcotics, and Actavis; that's DNA
Got a Dyke-ho, Nympho, And your bitch layin' next to me and bae
Eazy like NWA, they make me feel A-OK
Feeling like Tony, "Grrreat!"; feeling all on me, TSA
She got Dollars, Nut, and Alcohol all over her T&A
She snort all this KKK, and this broad need AAA
Let's enjoy some NBA, y'all lil boys NCAA
Yeah we got A-M-M-O, but you'll get beat like MMA
I got Dracos, Ninos, Automatics; that's my DNA
You'll get beat like Sugar Ray, TKO, O-H-H
I smoke O's, I sip Ace, I pop whole Xanies straight
I got P's, I got weight, I got kis, I got gates
I got moonrock, molly, ecstasy, inside this weed, it's laced
I smoke doobies, don't smoke J's
Don't watch movies, don't go to plays
I watch cuties, porn, and play
I got Uzis on the way
I don't be choosey, I don't be safe
I don't get woozy, I get the waist
My bitch ballin' like Sinead, Erykah Badu with the fade
Capital-WNBA, I just teach her how to save
I been sleepin' with my AK, with my finger around her waist
I been dreamin' I caught a body —
That's some sweet dreams, who want a taste?
Give the American dream to a bitch that ain't even from the USA
That's the land of the Free, it's the home of AJ
Got a whole brick of some yay, I put one line on the plate
She's gon' take it to the face, like "Thin line between love and hate"
I got Dealers 'N' Associates, call that my DNA
All these diamonds, all this gold and shit, call that PB&J
I got Bloods in LA, I got Bloods down in the A
I got Bloods everywhere you lay
But ain't no blood in my filet
Hit the court, shoot the DA, treat beef like USDA
OMW to your trap, (Blap!) — Now I'll be On My Way
I got plugs I ain't got to pay, I got shit I ain't got to say
I got cribs way out of state, I ain't got no more pocket space
Sippin' slo-mo at my pace, lean like I wear a brace
Queens want to be embraced, Kings want to be an Ace
I remember Ace of Spades, I remember the Goose is Grey
Now it's Bumbu by the case, nigga, fuck you, fly away
Six shit, (blrrrp)

[Break: DJ Drama & (Lil Wayne)]
Dedicated
To the culture that Tunechi birthed
To the sons and daughters of Weezy
Y'all niggas still watching a master at work
(I already got...)
D6

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I already got the Ganja
I already got the Fanta
All black like Uganda
Hair back like E. Honda, wait
Hardhat like a condom
Your skull crack, then we crowned you
Shark bite to a flounder
Bar fight to a bouncer, wait
All Franks like Sinatra
Face been painted, they ain't never clowned him
Everybody rakin' cash like it's autumn
Y'all boys sweeter than Whatchamacallit
All y'all take a seat on this toilet
Y'all ain't shit, but y'all piss-poor, and
Sittin' in the foreign like I'm on a Harley
Keep bloodsuckers away with the garlic
Alone in a mansion, I'm Macaulay Culkin
Thought about your coffin and started barfin'
Thought about your orphans, how they probably starvin'
Thought about this artful shit, how I'm so thoughtful
Walkin' on the marble, feelin' like Ricardo
Walkin' 'round like the campus of Harvard
Shoutout my nigga Swizz, niggas gettin' smarter
Try to hit the books, and nigga hit the target
Sittin' on the charter, talkin' 'bout the targets
Waitin' on departure, waiting on a sculpture
Make sure my vultures keep an extra cartridge
And make sure my Barbies keep an extra Barbie
My dick is her electric chair, feel the voltage
And her pussy better smell like a orchid
Wetter than a wishin' well, need a quarter
Damn, I wish I was a lil bit taller
Damn, I wish I drank a lil more water
Damn, my weed stank a lil more harder
Damn, I pull up with a redbone, scarlet
With a yellowbone car
That smoke green, that's Marley
Purple and the orange, you seen, that's horror
No Eve in my garden, F-R-uh, F-R-uh
All the Gs in my corner, them boys so warriors
Believe we deserve every leaf in the forest
Kis and quarters layin' around my headquarters
Borderline hoarder, you a mortal, I report her
World on my shoulders but it's lighter than a clover
I'm your bitch, baby, hold me tighter than a stroller
System so solar, got white like Crayola
Nut like granola all in your bitch rollers
You never been in jail, I never been in a Corolla
Then I roll a blunt 'bout as thick as a Samoan
This is that six shit, the sickness is showin'
The sickness is spreadin', the disease is growin'
The bitches is hoein', the witnesses knowin'
The dollars are torn, they fishing for coins
I continue goin', I get to the boar and
I rip off his horns, six in the mornin'
Then I just yawn and forget to mourn and
Give to the star, it's 6, the reward



[Verse]
Everything was meant, everything was meant
I took a L, what comes after L? My nigga — Ms
That AK with the twins, that's Mary Kate and sis
My shooters, they don't miss, fade away, then swish
Dedication 6 and everyday we sick
Treatin' medication scrips like some Revelation scripts
I thought yesterday we quit
But you know, every day we spent
Then we celebrate the win like we'll never play again
Lord I just talked to my hitman, he say that he made a list
Nigga always breakin' in, and he never leave a print
And I never shaved a brick, OK, now I'm talkin' shit
Where that bakin' soda mix? Raise my Arm & Hammer fist
And my yellowbone, she thick, and her belly don't exist
And she never saw the gym, she stay healthy 'cause she strip
Doin' very late events, and I never paid a cent
Pussy never leave a scent, Toni Braxton, breathe again
Every day, all week, we lit, you know every day we sip
And we having steak and shrimp with some naked waitresses
Told that bitch to bring a friend, you know that we make 'em kiss
She know if it's goin' down, I keep a elevator lit
Now where the elevator music? Yeah, they better play the hits
I can serenade a bitch, you interrogate a bitch
If we interrogate that bitch, we be like "Where that safe at, bitch?"
Put that barrel to her tits, and if she hesitate, that's it
I need that combination bitch, 'cause I ain't got no patience bitch
I hate to do it, but the line between love and hate is thin
You know every day we win, you know second place ain't shit
You know that we take the kids, just like Freddy, Jason, IT
You know that we spray and dip, one-eight-seven, eighty-six
While you eatin' bacon grits again while police takin' tips
You know every day we drip, drippin' wet Mercedes-Benz
Drippin' wet and glazy clit, you know every day she drenched
This that Dedication 6, you know everyday we sick
Give me wet, a life, a gift, catch a body like the Lyft
This that Dedication 6, if she starstruck, make a wish
I tell her pussy "Take your lick", I'm big-headed, make it fit
You know everyday we sick

[Outro: Lil Wayne & DJ Drama]
That's some sick shit, yeah
Shoutout Young Money!
You know everyday we sick
That's some sick shit, oh
My nigga Mack Maine
And that's that Dedication 6
You know everyday we sick
And you are just a patient, bitch
It's that Dedication 6
You know everyday we sick
And that's some sick shit, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
That's some sick shit, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
That's some sick shit, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You know everyday we sick



[Intro: Gudda Gudda]
Take that shit off at the front
Gudda! Lord

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Sleep on me, I hope you die in your sleep
No one's defiant as me
I know my worth, so when you pay me
Just know that I am not cheap
On the road to riches
Tappin' my horn, so watch for the beep
Rippin' this shit to pieces
No, I will not look out for the beat
Started out on the block
Got on my feet and rose to the top
I'm the cleanup man with the mop
50 shots disfigured his top, yes
I come from the city of God
I walk around in the city like God
Made it out and still come back
Somebody, please tell me, what are the odds?
On this mic I am a wizard, but this is not Oz
Cold but hot, I can turn the summer to fall
I'm sicker than y'all
Don't talk to me unless you talkin' 'bout paper
I'm buyin' some acres, no time for a neighbor
I'm from New Orleans, yes, I am a gator
I’ll do you a favor, and not do you a favor
'Cause if I do you a favor
And you don't come back with that paper
I'ma have to lay hands on you
Like I'm givin' you prayer
Eastside, we ain't playin' it fair
You ever heard of the tortoise and hare?
I'm switchin' the gear
Started off in the back, bitch
But now I'm winnin', it's clear
Nigga, I'm here
Gudda!

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
For real
(Blows smoke)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got my married hoes on single drugs
Got my fattest hoes gettin' finger fucked
And my trashiest hoes is clean as fuck
And my nastiest hoes is neat as fuck
Take your shoes off before you walk inside
Take your shoes off before you cross the line
I snoozed off on Father Time
Got my goons to go kidnap Daughter Time
Come to wet the party up, and whoever in it
Got one gun that shoot for seven minutes
I'm done shitting, niggas never spit it
I'm high class, niggas' elementary
Repetition, that's the definition
I'm a Hot Boy under air conditionin'
Shoot the gun with the left arm limpin'
George Jefferson in all seven minutes
Got a hot girl off television
With a very sticky unhairy kitty
In the right position, screamin' "You're consistent"
I sit there and listen like we talkin' business
I don't need her out here filmin' niggas
I'd really rather have her steal from niggas
I really travel like a pilgrim, nigga
Kush loud as Fred screamin' "Wilma!", nigga
I've been takin' time out to count the bands
Break a promise in the promised land
Going zagga zow off of zagga xans
From the middleman to the Macho Man
I've been talkin' shit up in Diddy house
Went to Disneyland, talked to Mickey Mouse
Then I figured out how to figure out
What I was figurin' out, you figure it out
Got a trigger man with an extra hand
My bitches sleep by my bitch's house
So every party is a slumber party
Sky is the limit, head in the clouds
While you runnin' round, I'ma run it up
You dumb it down, I ain't dumb enough
I hit the courtroom and stunk it up
High comin' down, plug comin' up
You gon' hold me down, you gon' hold me up
You don't know me, but you know what's up
And the coke was cut with some extra coke
Showed her more than love, she just shoulder-shrugged
She don't know it's love, it's not important love
As long as we can keep extortin' the plug
Just let him bleed and ignore the blood
Just let him be and ignore the buzz
Pour it up, catch a sugar rush
Chopper full of rust, but it still bust
Bust good as fuck, every bullet struck
Like a hundred holes, got a hole-in-one
Safe full as fuck, money full of dust
And I'm pulling up in that "What the fuck?"
That's a muscle car, got me lookin' buff
If you look enough, you a mussel, punk
That's a Bugatti on steroids
Bugatti on Chevron
All-white like an Altoid
All these rings on, call me Bellboy
From the Teflon to the Kevlar
Don't mean shit when your head off
Make the top dog jump dead off
And we keep his head for a memoir
I sped off with the head off
Goin' big Bruno on Mars
Sippin' Lone Star, turn a pornstar
To a known star with a phone call
Hold up; murky, murky water, yeah
Purple, purple rivers, yeah
Floatin' purple ribbons, yeah
I'm cursed, but still religious, damn
I've been poppin' 10s, yeah
'Cause my bitch pop all the 20s, damn
Why you hatin' on the skinnys, damn
I met Satan, he was chillin', hold up

[Outro]
Murky, murky water
Purple, purple rivers
Floatin' purple ribbons
I'm cursed but still religious
Damn
Take your clothes off bitch
Call your road dog, bitch
I feel like O-Dog, bitch
Boyz 2 Menace



[Intro: HoodyBaby and Lil Wayne]
And when I bust I yell, "Eureka", yeah
And when I bust I yell, "Eureka", yeah

Dropped out of school, I fucked the teacher
Spent a mill on misdemeanor

Spendin' money like amnesia
Spent some money on sativa
Got that strip club diabetes

Cut your tongue off, leave you speechless
Put some money on subpoenas
Could've gave that to Miss Cita
Nigga stunner, he a skeezer
From the heart and out the speakers
I was young, I heard the preacher

She snort one line, want a sequel
She snort two and want a threesome
She snort three lines, yell "Adidas"
When I bust I yell "Eureka"
When I bust I yell "Eureka"
When she bust she yell for Jesus
Drop her off at the cathedral

Phones are tapped, we switch the lingo

Clean the blood off the walls
Then break out the Stanley Steamer
It's a drought on cocaina
I know routes through Pasedena
I got two keys of that Bieber
Call 'em Justin and Justina
Sippin' on that Angelina
I'm low profile in a Beamer
Where it's sour, could be sweeter
I got sugar, I got creamer
More extremer, more obscener
Doin' numbers, yellin' "Bingo"
Coca leaf so come and get some
White power from a negro
Spent some money on my legal
And that money was illegal
That's my bloody, that's my migo
Reppin' cinco like he Tito
I'm gettin' high under gazebo
With a bride and no tuxedo
I'm a bitch magnet, Magneto
Hit that pussy like the R.I.C.O
Young money with no wrinkles
Hot tubbin' with the chicas
Run around naked like they streakers
Run around this bitch like Ezekiel
Good Quality coke, that's GQ
Boy this base don't need no EQ
She snort one line, want a sequel
When I bust I yell "Eureka", hey

[Verse 2: HoodyBaby]
Took her out the game, sent her to the bleachers
Kick her out in style, Balenciaga sneakers
Broke up with my bitch, I feel like shit, my dog
She kept talkin' fifty-fifty, had to split, my dog
She kept on fallin' in and out of love, I tripped her dog
Told me eat or get ate, so I sipped her dog
I'ma go platinum, she single
She blow up my phone, but the bitch got no ringer
Bought her a ring but I left with a finger
Stack up my cake and I bust down some zingers
Hello, ho, you gots to go, ho
I'm on the road, ho, high profile, movin' work on the low
Smokin' OG, girl you gotta go
Know you ain't on, girl you gotta know
Got that backward, girl, you kinda slow
The snakeskin I know you see on, this a no

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And when I bust I yell eureka, yeah
And when I bust I yell eureka, yeah

I'mma drop a bag, they gon' pull up
And then they gon' let them things off

Percocets and Addies, lookin' for a fuck I could give
All these hatin' bitches plottin', why they can't let me live?

Pushed them out my pussy though
Niggas want my cookie though
'Cause it taste like cookie dough
Smoke, I got a free pack; flow sick, get a Z-pak
Niggas don't mean my race when they say she blacked

Bitch get on your kneecap, I don't mean C. Kaep'
I'll get you checked, pussy; I'll get you a free pap
You bitches don't ball out, you get your QB sacked

Tell 'em carry on, they gon' miss me when I'm gone
I'm gone

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

She start cryin' and said her job hard, yeah
Switch her whip out, put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Honda

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Cocaine on her navel, lick it so my tongue can go HAM
Put my face up in her pussy and my thumb in her ass
Make her do the jumpman, ayy
I put her face down in the pillow, 'bout to smother her ass
A fly yellow bone to me, I told her to come get a tan
Now she butter pecan
Oh, I got a Draco in the sofa, an Eggo in the toaster
A cradle in the chocha, the yayo doing yoga
And I wake up, smell the Folgers, I don't know how I woke up
'Cause I was in a coma, but now I'm in the moment
Wearing high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowin'
The plug ain't charge me nothin' for it
I cried tears of fuckin' joy
LVs on my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'
I pull up with my skaters
Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the Walmart
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Ne-Yo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Playin' hunger games; mmm-yummy, man
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your mother's name
Hit the address, knockin' down picture frames and other things
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane
A nigga screamed, the hoes wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butcher came
And the Nina came, and her sister came
And what's her name, it’ll go Buka Bang
You don't even know where to put the blame, that's cold

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Got 'em feelin' like they five star
Your hoes throwin' fits, my bitches patient
Man, I feel just like a doctor

She start cryin' and said her job hard
Switch her whip out, put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Honda

[Outro]
Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes

Put her ass up in a dumb Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Smart Car
Switch her, put her in Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Kia
Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Uber
That's some sick shit



[Intro]
On God, Dedication 6
On God, Dedication 6
On God, yeah

[Hook]
25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And, bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful where you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrian

[Verse]
You bought a car for the bitch
I buy the narcs for the bitch
You buy apartments and shit
It's nice, I just walked in this bitch
You buy the art for the bitch
Y'all argue too often and shit
You always startin' some shit
That should come off of the bench
Shout out my homies I miss
Nino and Tony and Mitch
This ain't no call you and shit
She wan' come snort all this shit
She wan' go hard with a bitch
She know what happens today
She know we always forget
And she just posted the shit
And he just saw his lil bitch
Tell him I want him to trip
Tell him my guns gettin' skinny
Tell him they're starvin' for this
Give me the check, give me the throne
My hair is a minute too long
My bitch look like Vivica-Berry
Your bitch look like Rosetta Stone
I made my bitch go get a clone
Fuck 'em together and then on they own
When they catch feelings, I’m gone
I'm whippin' the Winnie the Coupe
I'm drivin' and sippin' the soup
The shit made me drift in the coupe
As long as I get to the stu'
Ruler clip, Rick the Ruler slick
Pull up on your bitch, you just called your bitch
Got that "Who is this?" She don't know you exist
She on her Mula shit, that's that truer shit
Make you eat your words, make you chew your shit
Then we knockin' out every tooth you pick
Nigga, fuck you, and fuck who you with
Yeah my bitch broke, but her booty fixed
Wait, I just popped a Perc, another for dessert
I washed it down with syrup
I just left planet Earth, ran into Captain Kirk
I pop a Perc, I'm trippy, call me Perc Nowitzki
Just call her Lewinsky
Blurry, blurry vision
Blrrp— "Hello, who is this?"
I just hit the line
I got a bitch in mind, I call her anytime
She taller, but it's fine, together we 6-9
I hit her other line, he like, "What other line?"
She like, "Never mind" And she can tell a lie
And I can tell she's lyin', that's no lie
That's my awesome lil bitch
Got me a saucy lil bitch
Got me a bossy lil bitch
Left her for a bossier bitch
It cost me a arm and a dick
I got me a naughtier bitch
She suck on the balls and the stick
I'm about to play golf with the bitch
I'm way on Mars with the bitch
She fuckin' with Martians and shit
You shoppin' at Marshall's and shit
And yeah, your bitch gettin' trippy with me
Want a quickie with me
Say she wish that I had Nicki with me
Say she'd lick her with me
Wish you wish I had my nigga with me
Bitch, you washy-wishy
Y'all can't trick me
She said "God, forgive me"
I say "Nah, I'm busy"

[Bridge]
I got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 bank accounts
Plus a main account, with insane amounts
That's somethin' to think about
Plus the drank in route, now I'm hangin' out
With 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 bitches ready to drink me down
Ready to drink me down, ready to drain me out
Plus my main in town, and she came around
Said they ain't her style

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful where you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrians
(Err!)

[Outro]
Six shit, on God
Dedication 6 on God
Dedication 6 on God
That's some sick shit
Oh Lord
Dedication 6 oh Lord
Dedication 6 oh Lord
Yes Lord
Dedication 6 yes Lord
Dedication 6 yes Lord



[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I been walkin' on this water, bone dry, hard times
R.I.P. baby, my phone died, but don't cry
Heaven's gates was closed, I went to Hell, there was a long line
Two hoes in the bed, it's hard to wake up on the wrong side

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Few bumps in the road, a little bump and grind I don't mind
Please know, for your fuckin' piggy bank you could get hog tied
Two Ninas on me, you fuck with me, them girls goin' wild
Guilty conscience pimpin', make my ho sit through the whole trial
I been walkin' on this fuckin' water for a long time
Molly water got me transformin' like I'm Voltron
Smokin' so much weed, I might just fuck around and hug a tree
A tree without a bird 'cause I deserve every fuckin' leaf

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
1, 2, 3; triple-OG
At the T-O-P smokin' P-O-T
From a D-O-G to the G-O-D
Got OCD and not your CD
Hit her with the D-O-P-E D
That's Dope Dick Tunechi, DDT
You could D-I-E for a F-E-E
I'll D-I-E for my S-E-T
I told my son that "Whatever the sun touch is yours, little nigga"
I told my daughter, "Don't give up your love to a poor little nigga"
I told my bitch if she cheat then she making a poor decision
I told that bitch if she leave then she leavin' the solar system
But hoes don't listen
But I'm on the road to riches, and she can't ignore the engine
I bought myself a medallion that cost an Azure, my nigga
I don't know, guess I was bored, my nigga
Tell foreign hoes "I'm El Señor", my nigga
To the Moon like Warren, nigga
He ain't the plug unless he foreign, nigga
It ain't a car unless it's foreign, nigga
And a R plus another R, my nigga
But I used to want a Ford Explorer, nigga
Had to move the trap house to Florida, nigga
Had to move the car to by the water, nigga
But I'm still too scared to get in the water, nigga
'Bout to throw another pool party, nigga
I told a op that wherever this gun point is hoes, lil nigga
Stayin' on my feet, no tappin' on my toes, like Moses, nigga
I told the cops that my car is too fast to pull over, nigga
Cool as fuck, keepin' my cool before my composure, nigga
That's poker, nigga
Playin' the cards I was dealt, and that shit almost broke a nigga
But I could be broker, nigga
But I’m watching Oprah, nigga
In my white house layin' on my sofa, keepin' it soulful, nigga
I'm a young mogul, nigga
I'm a young Hova, nigga
My office is oval, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I step out that bitch like, "What's happenin'?"
Me and that little bitch I was nappin' in
Time to run with no rubber, I'm gamblin'
Just call me the rapper, I'm Chancin' it
Got a sassy bitch, told her "I'm daddy, bitch"
Does it look like I'm playin'? Kaepernick
Niggas don't know a star from an asterisk
This that new coffin, new casket shit
My killers killin' on purpose by accident
And you felt that shit like a laxative
Ain't where or why you trap, it's who you trappin' with
For me it's about who I travel with
Never about the bitch that I be snappin' on
It's the one that the picture just snapped me with
That's 'cause I'm the shit, and all of my shit be miraculous
E

[Verse 4: Baby E]
Yeah, said
This that Baby E and Wayne shit
We just landed in a spaceship
So now ain't nobody safe, bitch
It's Dedication number 6, bitch
Got a hundred in the safe, bitch
I been fuckin' on a gay bitch
Fuck your set and what you claim, bitch
It's Young Mula to the grave, bitch
I'm still finessin', and I'm still progressin'
This is tick, tick-tick, I'ma blow up any second, yeah
We the bestest, ain't no fuckin' question
It's six, six-six, 'til it's Dedication 7
Fully loaded, money is the motive
All my bros' Gs, take a guess at what the code is
Overflowing, fuck it pour some more in
Rest In Peace Lil Peep, we already miss you homie

[Outro: Baby E]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said "I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge



[Intro: DJ Drama]
I realize you niggas is like the objects in the rearview mirror—
You really appear much closer than you are
Got a long way to go, young boy

[Verse 1: Euro + DJ Drama]
Uh
Uh
Check
(Catch up, niggas!)
Let 'em all in, bet 'em all in
Put me in the jungle, I get us all minks
Don't play with my wave
Know what? Let 'em all sink
I don't need therapy, I got so big
Even when they talk crazy I still don't shrink
I'ma black out, Michael Blackson's skin tone
Homie gotta sit for a while back home
Hotline bling if you get his phone
Gotta own up or you get disowned
Eyes dried up, I don't really cry much
And the gold chain match everything I touch
Whip gotta match every bitch I fuck, foreign
Y'all niggas talkin' 'bout what? Borin'
Bane from it, I came from it
I'm raised by it, I'm stained from it
Shot for the stars from the darkness
I aim from it, now change comin'
Who'd have thought a nigga shake somethin'?
All these records, I'ma break somethin'
Playin' my shit around the graveyard
Y'all fuck around and wake somethin'
Mean mug like I hate somethin'
Hit the stu' and I ate somethin'
Great rapper or a great hustler—
Promise you I die a great somethin'

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
And I am beginnin' and endin'
A nigga run in kickin' and flippin'
A nigga worth spendin'
A nigga with the semi admittin'
Glock is definitive on 'em, iron Emmys
Got an eye on 'em
Still on these niggas more than any one of you
We knuck if we buck, if you my brother we up
If not, I don't give a motherly fuck
Only in us we trust, you fuss we hush
They rush we bust, adjust, and dust and flushed 'em
If you don't know what my salary is
You 'bout to know what a fatality is
What the reality is
If I don't know what my calories is
Then nine times out of ten
You won't never know where your cavity is
Hit a forty, know it had to be his
A dude foul with a smile
They would never know how mad that he is
They don't ever know what pattern he is
He gotta be from Earth 2, or somewhere from out on Saturn he is
Now I'm goin' where no gravity is, some other galaxy shit
But we'd rather talk about the MAC and the bricks
We takin' on all names, it ain't no more games
I'm a stand up nigga, Cory Kaepernick bitch
I don't know what to call you
Niggas claimin' they loyal to the soil
But boy I'm loyal to the oil that boil
To court with the all you
You cannot avoid it when I'm gonna destroy you
Work from the ceiling to make sure that I fall you
I'm dedicated to this rhyme shit
S double, the militia gang, they don't ever try them bitch
I got a nine and click, a high been brick
A bottom bitch, I buy them thick
Drivin' stick, I'm fly as a bitch, and I give dick
I ride the five, my partner crip
Shout out the East, we parkin' shit
I just revive, I don't remix
I don't remind, until C5 we got D6, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
The best things in life are free, not cheap, free C5
Message, no reply
Rest In Peace, no peace sign
I keep an eye on these guys
My third eye give her sweet eyes
The bird eye's view keep spy
But I can get your wings deep fried
Try, try again, keep tryin'
All the traffic hours, you a taxi driver, we some maximizers
Ever heard of San Francisco 49'ers, we some masterminders
Made it to the top just to get sniped from the floor at the very bottom
Ain't that a bitch, man tell me about it
But I ain't trippin', unless the trip is private
I sip in silence
I tried to make it beautiful, and this shit came out perfect
Let the guns speak for they self, I ain't never been a loud person
Walkin' 'round the house in the turban
These niggas washed up with no detergent
Take your heart and I am not a surgeon
Pullin' triggers like shower curtains
Ain't got no soul because my baby sucked it out of me
Me and my whoas in Las Vegas playing the thot machines
Stick to my goals, expectations like a soccer team
Waiting to exhale only to let out some steam
Girl let's make a movie, what's a movie without a shower scene?
Treat my semi like an Emmy, need some nominees
Taught me how to count before they taught me how to read
I knew all my OG's before my ABC's

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Damn
That's some sick shit

[Intro]
Gangsta—
Gangsta—
Gangsta Grizzils

[Verse]
Well, tonight I found my price to the spender
And she cried about our life to the listener
And she asked me for advice, so I pimped her
Turn that chicken head to a chicken tender
In a Wraith, in a Wraith, out of state license plates
I got yay an AK and a temper
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
Don't know how I'm drivin' straight
I sipped a lake of that grape, thirst quencher, oh
Girl, fuck with him and get your money
You fuck with me, you missin' money, then you miss your molly
I get the money, spend the money, then I miss the money
But it come right back, right back, right back
That's that Frisbee money
That's Santa climbin' down the chimney, money with the duffy
It come back, run around the gang, yeah that's some dizzy money
The Humpty Dumpty, she get on that dick, she's very comfy
I put a Rolie on her wrist, she used to wear a scrunchy
Party times, Tunechi wise
Wifey's size, truly lies
Booty, thighs, bougie pride
Gucci slides, moody, tired
Woozy, high, movie night
Jacuzzi time, ooo-ee, ahh
Dinner, prime; sushi, wine
And for dessert I have the cutie-pie
Lied about the price to the spender
And I lied about my height on Tinder
And if I hit it one time I won't remember
But can't forget it if she bring another member
Double date, double date
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
Bitch, I'm eatin' full plate like November
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
In a different mind state
Let her sniff some snowflakes and call her Winter (yah)
Fuck with him and get the money
Then come fuck with me and split the money
I'll fuck her when she with her buddy
She guzzle dick and kiss her buddy
She said I love you when he send some money
I said I love you give your pimp some money
And she don't ask how much she just come dump it
And I don't ask how high I just start jumpin'
You ain't know I kiss below the button, what
Girl close your eyes and let me show you somethin', what
And if you ride me like the road is bumpin', what
I leave my key in and the motor runnin', what
Oh my god I hope they kissin' cousins
If they not it's gon' be consequences, repercussions
Woah, I just count a hundred thousand hundreds
And I told my babe ride the wave, Cowabunga
Lied about her night to her nigga
Her vagina 'bout to cry me a river
If she ask me for advice and I igged her
But she know it wasn't me, it was the sizzurp
Gotta wait, gotta wait
'Til I wake, 'til I wake
I wake up and tell bae how much I missed her
She looks straight in my face then start pointin' to the space
Where she want it on her face, she's particular

[Outro]
Y-O-U-N-G with money, yeah
We Y-O-U-N-G with money
Y-O-U-N-G with money
Y-O-U-N-G with money
Ayo, Stunna nigga need his money
You heard somethin' Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da, ooh
Y-O-U-N-G with money
I hear us comin', six shit



[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
I'mma cash out on the AP, new freezer
The coupe sit nice on some new feet, new sneakers
I took your bitch out to Pappadeaux's
She tried to order a sloppy joe
I told her give me some sloppy toppy
Then let her know she a sloppy ho
Tune pick me up in this brand new Bugatti
Two million cash, this is not a Ferrari
260 the dash, I smoke anybody
150K cash, it fit in my pocket
This is that D6, shout out to Drizzy in the 6
Mafia like it's the Three 6
Choppers make niggas do B-flips
Put the heat to your moon like an eclipse
Burn niggas like a freak bitch
Flip and turn you like a key switch
'Cause you bit the hand that I feed with, yeah
Only time will tell, nigga
I sat back and tried to tell niggas
If you try to test me, watch you fail, nigga
D-triple-6, I'm raisin' hell, nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Death wish, death wish, death wish
I come to fulfill your death wish
First I must refill my beverage
That's promethazine, sold separate
That's from Texas, she's from who knows
I got new doors I ain't step in
I got new hoes I ain't hit yet
I ain't hit yet? Time is precious
I got pre-rolls I ain't lit yet
I got pre-thoughts I ain't think yet
I got money I ain't see yet
And they wan' know why I ain't blink yet
I got big bags in my book bag
Make me walk around like Hunchback
Diamonds so bright on my one hand
Gave all five fingers a sun-tan
Haters upset, that's a fun fact
I got pussy in my lunch bag
I got soap and I got towels
Bullet showers lead to bloodbaths
I got hoodies that say 'Young Money'
I got bitches that steal them from me
They go home and then they send pictures
To my phone with nothing under it
What am I to do? I'm lovin' it
I run a bad-ass bitches company
That's my company, my bitches humble me
I saw your bitches, that was comedy
I got the romedy, oops I meant remedy
I got the chemistry, and the amenities
Up in my bedroom, holding assembly
They leave feelin' good; physically, mentally
Meditate, meditate; think about yesterday
Fuck what that nigga say, think about yesterday
I can't do everyday, I could do very late
Just hit me up and now go check my resume
Get out that Chevrolet, jump in this better Wraith
I know you see the doors open like Heaven Gates
She think I'm Heaven sent, and I would not forgive every sin
But I forget everything
Thanks to the medicine, thanks to the purple stuff
I'm finna pour it up, I'm finna stir it up
If I had a heart it'd be a purple one
Pockets too fat, I'm pulling my girdle up
Shots of Bumbu, I'm finna serve 'em up
I got them comfy and kind and courteous
I put the old bodies in the new freezer
Brrrr, I never heard of her, six shit



[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Mmm-mh

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I been smokin' on the gas, hocus pocus on the gas
I been snorklin' in the cash, going Krogers with the bags
I done went blonde, goin' Hulk Hogan on they ass
Tell my shooters "Count me out", and I end up doin' the math
I been fuckin' in the shower so my dreads soaked
I been fuckin' on the counter 'cause my bed's soaked
You know my lean nice and cold, like some dead folks
You know my eyes nice and low, like I make egg rolls, oh
I got them pills, we call 'em illies
I got the wet, I'm water whippin'
I rob his ass like Robin Givens
I get them Ms a mile a minute
Don't pay your bill, I'm power trippin'
BET, that's how I'm livin'
I got three hoes followin' me
Ho, ho, ho; I'm down the chimney
Hello, I make her throw away her pussy toys, yeah
Ain't got a job, I make her look employed, yeah
She do the money count in just her drawers, yeah
I make her count out loud, I listen hard
I been fuckin' models, they been walkin' 'round in towels
They been snortin' powder, I been in here takin' downers
They been countin' for hours, getting kisses by the thousands
Money and the power, they be in here watchin' Power
All my shooters accurate, codeine like a daiquiri
Run up, run up in your factory, mask is on like Michael Jackson
Brrrt! Pull up like a taxi, stereo on maxi
Nigga, bury your own casket
Nigga, say hello to Rabbit
My lil homies bang, my lil homies, they deranged
They don't want the fame, kill your ass then fly to Spain
Ding-ding, coke and ice cream, that shit got a nice ring
Put my face up in the pussy, I'm just sight-seeing
Yeah, starin' at the world through an automatic
Sweet mother of pearl, sweet Jesus of Nazareth
Quickly, quickly, quickly, gettin' slow, baby
I could turn your baby to a poor baby, sure baby
Look, I cannot sit down without gettin' down
What's new in town? Let's do it now
A couple marbles ain't been found
A couple screws been screwed around
My father ain't been 'round, my heart ain't missed a pound
The system of a down, and it's been up and down
A psycho, all I'm missin' is the gown
Sippin' up, I piss enough to drown, twistin' up a pound
High as fuck, a Bentley truck on clouds, y'all so underground
I break a whole bunch of fuckin' vows
Come to hunt you down
All up in your section
Use protection when you fuck around
Possession of deception, imperfection, no affection
No correct your transgression, turn depression to aggression
Got an obsession for expression
With no pressure, no discretion, and the F is for the
"Flesh of all the fleshless ones, I left 'em, F 'em."

[Verse 2: Zoey Dollaz]
Your bitch open so we run in it, any club, got my gun in it
I ain't even got to touch you dudes, I'll get you killed young nigga
Eat, sleep, talk shit, rap, brand new AK, all black
Tunechi gave me this gift wrapped
Your bars sweet, candy, Kit-Kat
Hope you pussy niggas get mad
Keep the voodoo on me, witchcraft
Off-White, Gucci, mix match
All my diamonds drip, shit splash
Black BMW, your bitch gave me top at the W
She told me Dollaz I'm over you
These bitches way too emotional, uh
So much perkys, I'm barely sober
Diamond choker, crazy, bipolar
Keep my niggas with me, I tote 'em
Never be committed, I told her
Enough with you niggas, I do not fuck with you niggas
I know I'm stuck with you niggas
Grew up with you niggas
We all was swipin' cards, scammin' it up with you niggas
Miami ballin', it's a hobby, call a nigga Joe Robbie
Haitian food or hibachi, ATV's, walkie-talkies
Chris Paul, we load the rocket
Eight ball, corner pocket
Ah man, nigga stop it, you know it's Dollaz
When it comes to rap, no problems
Haha, hold up, talk to 'em
I'm the hottest out in my city, Bad Boy too, ask Diddy
Hundred foot yacht, jet skiin', bitches kissin' bitches, lesbian
Niggas talkin' beef, let's see 'em
Y'all don't want beef, y'all vegan
If so, come, no semen
(Yeah, you get it?)
Future put me on, he from Atlanta
Niggas in my city crabs in a barrel
Made it out without y'all help
I can say I did it myself
Tunechi told me leave this beat blessed
I killed this shit, no stress
First 48, this stretch
Someone tell me what's next?



[Intro: Lil Wayne + DJ Drama]
Six shit

[Verse 1: Euro + Lil Wayne]
I hear y'all new shit and I cringe (I cringe)
Your girlfriend likes me and my friends (My friends)
If we hit it, that oui is not French (Not French)
I'm anti-social, pardon my tints (My tints)
We left E11even, at 11 AM (Yeah)
Raw papers full of peace, cups full of mayhem (Yeah)
We all wavy, I'm just sort of on a different wavelength (Yeah)
See they more like superstars, I'm more like Super Saiyans
Bein' the greatest ever is my destiny still
Since a child I focused on my Kelly, Bey, and Michelle (Okay)
Sittin' back, getting head from Mademoiselle
Tryna' put every ghetto kid with a dream in my will
Dedicated to you for the 6th time, killed it on the 5th one
Now they say I'm big time
While them niggas skipped lunch, I learned how to skip lines
I learned how to kick, punch, power through to get mines
Used to fuck with Sega, my uncle had a pager (chirp!)
I knew this drug kingpin that tried to run for Mayor (skrt!)
Posted on the back blocks, talkin' player-player
If she bad then I upgrade her, get her unlimited data
They tryna' build a wall, man my dogs gon' hate that shit
And build underground railroads, so the Maybachs fit, yeah
We in the game, but we don't play that shit
Cover your soul before they take that shit
Young

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

Nigga runnin' through the white
Nigga, O.J. on my wrist
Nigga, that's Sunny Delight
Nigga, diamonds in my teeth, shinin' like some pearly whites
Nigga straight from New Orleans, like a plate of dirty rice
Nigga bought a lot of art, and I brought a lot to snort, hey
Beat around a bush, right after we beat the court case
Talking 'bout a war, that's a convo at the bar, wait
Drugs in the Broncos, start the mothafuckin' horse race
I take off from Earth and take your bitch up into MySpace
I tell her keep her mouth shut
If not I got some scotch tape
Got to keep the lock safe
Referrin' to the Safelock
The shelves fall, the ground shake
It make it do the James Brown
I still wear the same crown
Light-skin or light-brown
I still dick her right down
Hit her with the pipe bomb
Some niggas like to fight crime
Some niggas like to fight fair
Some niggas got the right time
You ask him, he say "Time'll tell"
Some niggas think they're icons
Some bitches think that I care
Some niggas got a iPhone
Some niggas had a SkyTel
Some niggas really pythons
I'm watchin' out for myself
Tattoos, black skin, red eyes, blonde hair
Lyin' there
Lookin' like "Aww, yeah"
Lawn chair
Jump right off the Con-Air
And landed on a timeshare
I wear Versace eyeware
Feelin' like top shelf
Cool as two Ls and Rock Bells
Hot as Scottsdale
Bombshell

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Blackin' out, blackin' out, we on the drugs
Blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out
All the guns, black it out, black it out, black-black-black it out
On the run, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, yo (Bow!)
Yeah, blackin' out, blackin' out, we on the drugs
Blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out

On the run, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, yo

Dedication 6

[Verse 1]
Roses are red, our eyes are too, yeah
The pillows, the bed, the light bulbs too, Suwu
The scarf on my head and her drawers too
None of this shit she heard before
My lies all new, true
I cross my heart, I won't cross you, damn
Ride me so good I need horse shoes, ohh
Eat that shit out like some soul food, yeah
Cut the shit down, you'll hear old Tune, brrp
She come to my house and I got drugs layin' 'round
So easy to pick up, and they so hard to put down
Gift and a curse
And she don't mind fuckin' with girls
As long as Tiffany's first
Hello, fuck it

[Hook]
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She get a little brazy, but she still wavy (Suwu)
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She get a little faded, but she still savin' (Fuck you)

[Verse 2]
Roses are red, our eyeballs too
We go from the sofa, to floor, to the bed, these nice walls too
Roses are red, our skin tone too, yeah
Let's go off to space, the way stars do, (Pewm)
We gone, it's all in our heads, and our hearts too, (Vroom)
I'm gone, she waitin' in bed for that part two, (Skrt)
I'm back, and we argue all mornin', fuck all noon, (Err-Ehh)
That's what the bed and the walls do
Hel-Hello? She come to my house and I got guns layin' 'round
But, she treat each one of them like it's her own child
Gift and the curse
And she don't mind fuckin' with girls as long as Tiffany's first
Hello, fuck it (Suwu)
Roses are red and my stones too
The roses are dead and my phone too
Damn, I'm changin' her life, her ringtone too
Cut that shit down, you'll hear old Tune

[Hook]
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She-she get a little brazy, but your bitch basic
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She said, "Fuck that nigga, Baby, I'm your real baby."
(Fuck it)
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She get a little faded, but she steal safely



[Chorus: HoodyBaby]
That's my dog for sure

We pullin' up in the Rolls
Me and my dawg (Me and my dawg)
To get all my dawgs back, I'd give up all you hoes
To get all my dawgs back, I'd give up all you hoes

[Verse 1: HoodyBaby]
HoodyBaby really, really rich
HoodyBaby pull up with the clique (hello)
Hoody crippin’' rollin' with the six
Now I'm in a 'Rari bumpin' Nip
Black and yellow bitches on my stick
Black and yellow, treat me like I'm Wiz
Hustle in Atlanta like I'm TIP
(Brrrrr, hello?)
College bitch, tweakin' for my dick
Hit her college park like I'm Tit
I want turkey pasta with the shrimp
That ain't have shit to do with this
30 bitches tellin' me I'm the shit
Juice man, screamin' 32
Juice man, screamin' 32
O.J. know my number's 36
Diamonds crip walkin' on my chest
Sent a package right to Bouldercrest
I heard your boy sippin Quali, y'all some qualiticians
Yeah we politic, but fuck a politician
You be smokin' Bobby Brown, new edition

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Run off with your bitch, she change her number
Run into another bitch and fumble
Money talkin' more than Bryant Gumbel
Too much shit on my mind, I need a plumber
Made love to a whore and changed my number
Pull up on a boat like I'm Columbus
Tongue all in her throat, all in her tunnel
Pussy monster, I'ma need a muzzle
Wake up Sunday night and go to LIV
A bitch back at the crib tryna live
A pool in the back, I let her swim
I give her phone back and let her film
Free will like the goodwill
She real thick, waist real lil
Weed real bright, it look teal
Coke real white, it look clear
0 to 100 to a mill
From nothin' to somethin' to a big deal
Got to keep it trill in the field
I ain't Cash Money no more
And I put some carats on my bitch's wrist
Put some carats on my bitch's fist
Put some carats in my bitch's ears
I came fast money, let's go
And my heart goes out to Vegas, keep it real
I just met some strippers on the strip
Flew 'em to Miami, take a trip
Flew 'em back to Vegas with some gifts
That's just how it is, is, is
Ain't trickin' if you got it, nigga rich
I feel like satan, nigga lit
Dedication 6-6-6
G-Wagon on six wheels
They in they feelin's, fuck how niggas feel
Coke in the car, I'm in a snowmobile
I'm sippin' that Evander Holyseal
This is that codeine overkill
My mud colder than Soldier Field
In love, but all these hoes is weird
These hair triggers, I might grow a beard
Brazy, yeah, but you know the drill
I'm way up there, you right over here
Have you ever seen the light hit my grill?
I stand there and smile in the mirror
Snap my fingers, dollars appear
Out of nowhere and I don't do L's
And I married the mob when I was like twelve
Turned out well, like Tom and Giselle
Ain't readin' texts 'cause I'm readin' checks
I don't text 'cause that is finger sex
Then I'm turnin' off my ringer next
Airplane mode, no I'ma need a jet
I'm dope, babe, I need a needle set
Chains rock it, can't see the neck
Pockets crowded like the Beatles set
I drop it off and gave Ms. Cita that
Whip milky, I'ma sip filthy
I sip this shit just like it's healthy
Who spilt it, wait my bitch guilty?
Uber, Uber; she'll be missed dearly
Sincerely, yeah it's yours truly
Call me Tune, the hoes call me Tunechi
Rockin' Louis while the pot brewin'
With a Chinese bitch that look like thot suey
Told the straight hoes I'm taken
Told the gay hoes I'm vacant
Took some diamonds out her old bracelet
Put 'em on the quotes in my statements
I'm a born slanger, a born slanger
One more time, I'm a born slanger
Draco like a volcano
You can fuck around and get your star spangled
Barbaric, yeah your bitch starin'
I look very good, good very
It ain't all about the werewolf
It's all about what the wolf wearin'
You a popped cherry, yeah a Cherry Bomb
We everywhere like the Marriott
Shots sprayed like Malaria
Hit your head like a Triceratops
For my dawg, I'll kill you and your ho
Yeah, me and my dawg, we put another on the road
Hold up my female dawg, she 'bout to put on a show
But to get my dawg back, I'd give up all of these hoes



[Intro]
Dedication 6
Ahh, ah
This that 6 shit
Ah, Dedication 6
Dedication 6
Ah, ahh
This that 6 shit
Ah, Dedication 6
Yah, yah-ahh

[Hook]
You ain't gotta lie to me
But you might have to lie for me
You might have to trap for me
You know I got mouths to feed
You know they got bitches that'd die to be
The bitch that'll die for me
Strap doves to her body and fly to me
But you get too high to me

[Post-Hook 1]
And you don't even believe in Yeezus
Why you wearin' Yeezy sneakers?
She ain't never swallowed semen
I don't even believe her speeches
You can't even keep a secret
Why you wear Victoria Secret
You don't even believe in peace
I'm fuckin' you with both my fingers

[Verse]
Baby I'm out your league, bitch
You know there's no more me's, bitch
You need to show more cleavage
V-neck polo tees, bitch
You need to patch your weave, bitch
You need to pack your things, bitch
You on some "I had a dream" shit
It's back to reality, bitch
She don't even roll the weed
All she do is roll her eyes
All she know is social media
We don't even socialize
I feel like North Korea
Even though we oceanside
All I say is "Mama-mia"
She don't even know her moms
All she say is "This your pussy"
She say that to most of the guys
She don't even know it's dry
I can't even open fire
She don't even close her eyes
She don't even close the blinds
She spit all over the D
I'm sticky like porcupines
She don't even compromise
I still make her cum three times
I still make her snort some lines
And make her look so surprised
I still her make her recognize
Make her exercise to a sexier size
Then I tell her how to tell better lies
Now her extra guys think she never lie
We got a better bond, we have a better time
She got a wetter pond
I cum ahead of time, and a second time
And in record time
I'm a New Orleans nigga, I make a second line
I'm a Megatron
I got her legs up like the Omega sign
And I know she rolling 'cause I checked her tires
Then I checked her eyes, she a little rough around the edges, fine
Like Checkers fries
And the X was mine
She requested five
So I gave her two and told her stretch the high
We had sex 'til nine, ate breakfast tired
Fell asleep eye to eye, thigh on thigh
Then she woke up high, like "Oh my God" and tried to rectify
But if you naked, why?
If you mesmerized be mesmerized
If you scared of love, I'm death-defyin'
Got to make your mind, I'ma make the guap
Got to take your time, I'ma take the shot
I'ma wake the block, I'ma break the lock
Then rape your thot, then shake the spot
I'ma shake your hand when I see you out
I'ma shake my head when you turn around
Cops shake they head when they see your house
We shot it up, but look like we burned it down
Hor-Horror scene, bitch
Everyday Halloween, bitch
Kidnap, hide and seek, bitch
I'm a legend like Socrates, bitch
I aim at your collard green, bitch
Bada-boom, bada-bing, bitch
I'm looking for a solid, clean bitch
I tell her "Look, honestly, bitch"

[Hook]
You ain't gotta lie to me
But you might have to lie for me
You might have to trap for me
You know I got mouths to feed
You know they got bitches that'll die to be
The bitch that'd die for me
Stickin' to a nigga like Siamese
And you just on the side of me

[Post-Hook 2]
And you don't even like Adidas
Why you wearin' Yeezy sneakers?
She ain't never had a threesome
I dont' even believe her speeches
She don't even believe in freedom
But all she giving me is freebies
You don't even believe in peace
I'm fuckin' her with both my fingers

[Outro]
6 shit
To be continued
D6!



[Intro]
On God, Dedication 6
On God, Dedication 6
On God, yeah

[Hook]
25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And, bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful where you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrian

[Verse]
You bought a car for the bitch
I buy the narcs for the bitch
You buy apartments and shit
It's nice, I just walked in this bitch
You buy the art for the bitch
Y'all argue too often and shit
You always startin' some shit
That should come off of the bench
Shout out my homies I miss
Nino and Tony and Mitch
This ain't no call you and shit
She wan' come snort all this shit
She wan' go hard with a bitch
She know what happens today
She know we always forget
And she just posted the shit
And he just saw his lil bitch
Tell him I want him to trip
Tell him my guns gettin' skinny
Tell him they're starvin' for this
Give me the check, give me the throne
My hair is a minute too long
My bitch look like Vivica-Berry
Your bitch look like Rosetta Stone
I made my bitch go get a clone
Fuck 'em together and then on they own
When they catch feelings, I’m gone
I'm whippin' the Winnie the Coupe
I'm drivin' and sippin' the soup
The shit made me drift in the coupe
As long as I get to the stu'
Ruler clip, Rick the Ruler slick
Pull up on your bitch, you just called your bitch
Got that "Who is this?" She don't know you exist
She on her Mula shit, that's that truer shit
Make you eat your words, make you chew your shit
Then we knockin' out every tooth you pick
Nigga, fuck you, and fuck who you with
Yeah my bitch broke, but her booty fixed
Wait, I just popped a Perc, another for dessert
I washed it down with syrup
I just left planet Earth, ran into Captain Kirk
I pop a Perc, I'm trippy, call me Perc Nowitzki
Just call her Lewinsky
Blurry, blurry vision
Blrrp— "Hello, who is this?"
I just hit the line
I got a bitch in mind, I call her anytime
She taller, but it's fine, together we 6-9
I hit her other line, he like, "What other line?"
She like, "Never mind" And she can tell a lie
And I can tell she's lyin', that's no lie
That's my awesome lil bitch
Got me a saucy lil bitch
Got me a bossy lil bitch
Left her for a bossier bitch
It cost me a arm and a dick
I got me a naughtier bitch
She suck on the balls and the stick
I'm about to play golf with the bitch
I'm way on Mars with the bitch
She fuckin' with Martians and shit
You shoppin' at Marshall's and shit
And yeah, your bitch gettin' trippy with me
Want a quickie with me
Say she wish that I had Nicki with me
Say she'd lick her with me
Wish you wish I had my nigga with me
Bitch, you washy-wishy
Y'all can't trick me
She said "God, forgive me"
I say "Nah, I'm busy"

[Bridge]
I got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 bank accounts
Plus a main account, with insane amounts
That's somethin' to think about
Plus the drank in route, now I'm hangin' out
With 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 bitches ready to drink me down
Ready to drink me down, ready to drain me out
Plus my main in town, and she came around
Said they ain't her style

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful where you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrians
(Err!)

[Outro]
Six shit, on God
Dedication 6 on God
Dedication 6 on God
That's some sick shit
Oh Lord
Dedication 6 oh Lord
Dedication 6 oh Lord
Yes Lord
Dedication 6 yes Lord
Dedication 6 yes Lord



[Intro]
Good Evening, it would be uncivilized to bring you this presentation without fair warning
You are about to discover the world of horror
Look no further than one's own mind
To find the very place where demons, even monsters hide
If you wish to vacate the premises please do so now
Well then, you've been warned

[Chorus]
I don't have the heart to hurt you
I don't have a heart at all
Don't you let your feelings steer you
Steer you straight into the wall
If you're still here by tomorrow
I'll forget about your past
She said hold me like the first day
I said fuck me like the last
'Cause you know I'm gone

[Hook]
Die alone, die, die alone
(Possibly)
Die alone, die, die alone
(Probably)
Die alone, die, die alone
(Possibly)
Die alone, die, die alone

[Verse 1]
I stayed away for days and months
Till the pain was numb
You see, I became the one I had to save you from
Everybody wanna tell you what you can't become
But wait, even the Devil was an angel once
I ain't the one, del Toro with a loaded gun
Fear and loathing in the Vegas sun, like it's '71
You said I'm better when I'm sober, that's when we conflicted
I was never sober around you, you couldn't see the difference
I told her maybe I'm just mad at myself
I think thats why I love everything that's bad for my health
Why am I dying to see Heaven when I was happy with Hell?
Somebody take this pack of shells and put em' back on the shelf (I mean)
Insomnia turn me into a zombie
I'm coming for all the moments they rob me of
Now it's obvious, since you made it a hobby of watching us
I be popping up, and copping all my ops binoculars like it's the opera, ugh!

[Chorus]
I don't have the heart to hurt you
I don't have a heart at all
Don't you let your feelings steer you
Steer you straight into the wall
Cause you know I'm gone

[Hook]
Die alone, die, die alone
(Possibly)
Die alone, die, die alone
(Probably)
Die alone, die, die alone
(Possibly)
Die alone, die, die alone



[Intro]
Yeah!

[Hook]
Fuck the day that I met you
Fuck the day that I met you
I'm smoking all of this weed baby, just to forget you
Fuck the day that I met you
Fuck the day that I met you
I'm drinking all of this drank baby, just to forget you
(forget you, forget you)
Mama told me you could catch  a bird with a breadcrumb
Hunnid niggas standin' outside, screamin' "Redrum!"
Try to make a hunnid million dollars ‘fore the Feds come
Mama told me you could catch a bird with a breadcrumb

[Verse 1]
Redrum, redrum
Man they say the money talkin', you ain't said none
I'ma stack a hunnid million for the feds come
Mama told me you could catch a bird with a breadcrumb
Right wing, left wing, house got a right wing, left wing
Is my ex 'ting, texting, my next 'ting?
With your bitch face resting, I just think
Maybe you was never nothing but a slide through
I know you never loved me, even though you tried to
'Member way back when I missed the days back then
I went to school high, never went to high school
Drug diet, drug diet, we had chemistry baby, I love science
The love dying, the love dying, sippin' purple rain 'tilI hear the doves cry

[Hook]
Fuck the day that I met you
Fuck the day that I met you
I'm smoking all of this weed baby, just to forget you
Fuck the day that I met you
Fuck the day that I met you
I'm drinking all of this drank baby, just to forget you
(forget you, forget you)
Mama told me you could catch a bird with a breadcrumb
Hunnid niggas standin' outside, screamin' "Redrum!"
Try to make a hunnid million dollars ‘fore the Feds come
Mama told me you could catch a bird with a breadcrumb

[Verse 2]
I remember when my doors closed, and the crib got foreclosed
Now I'm like fuck a wardrobe, this whole winter I just wore robes
Diamonds looking like it's morse code, hit you in your torso see your whole soul
Mixin' lean up in the orange soda, bitch I think I might just need a organ donor
Yeah I remember trappin' on the motorola
On the dolo, on the dolo
Feds' trynna flick a photo
On the low the fish tailin' in a new four door
In the new four door, fish tailin' in a new four door
With a couple hoes, two bad one ugly like total
God damn I got it!

[Hook]
Fuck the day that I met you
Fuck the day that I met you
I'm smoking all of this weed baby, just to forget you
Fuck the day that I met you
Fuck the day that I met you
I'm drinking all of this drank baby, just to forget you
(forget you, forget you)
Mama told me you could catch a bird with a breadcrumb
Hunnid niggas standin' outside, screamin' "Redrum!"
Try to make a hunnid million dollars ‘fore the Feds come
Mama told me you could catch a bird with a breadcrumb

She mix the lies with the truth, I mix the batch with the juice
I'm tellin' Hennessy lies, I'm tellin' Actavis truths
I think I'm relapsin' and shit, I just fell asleep in the shower
I'm feelin' weak, need some power
The plug gon' be back in an hour
She found a bag full of powder
"Oh no, baby, that ain't flour"
Told her jump up on the table, bet that pussy get devoured

We 'bout to pop a hundred bottles like it's water
You want that good batch, meet me at the border
You want that good batch, meet me at the border



[Hook: Belly]
You must have heard about the re-up
Call me real late, you know I'll be up
That's the only time you ever free up
I'm not tryna fuck the energy up
She said, baby, please don't get the wrong idea
Roll the tree and fuck this Hennessey up
I come down and start to get ideas
All my demons keep on waking me up

[Verse 1: NAV]
Born alone, die alone
I let the drugs take my soul
First time I bought some weed I was sold
If I get 40 thousand for a show
I'm scared I'll spend 20 thousand on some dope
Either RAF or Ricky on my toes
In high school I never made the honor roll
Poppin' mollies, I've been on a roll
Hope the highway doesn't take a toll
Smokin' blunts, burn the seat in the Rolls
No, I'm not the same NAV from before
I don't know who I am anymore
Woke up somewhere I ain't been before
Half a pill ain't enough anymore
They rappin' about drugs they never did before
What's fake and what's real? I don't know anymore
Takin' full bars, I should really split 'em
Fell on my face, had to really quit 'em
My broski up north whippin' in the kitchen
My uncle just lost his kidney
That won't stop me from poppin' and sippin'
You can tell that I'm gone from a distance
Poppin' prescriptions without a prescription
Told Santa, all I want is molly for Christmas

[Hook: Belly]
Re-up
Call me real late, you know I'll be up
That's the only time you ever free up
I'm not tryna fuck the energy up
She said, baby, please don't get the wrong idea
Roll the tree and fuck this Hennessey up
I come down and start to get ideas
All my demons keep on waking me up

[Verse 2: Belly]
Got a hell of a habit, take another tablet out the cabinet
Is there heaven for a savage, is there heaven for a savage?
I'm poppin' pills like an addict
The trap - how I learned mathematics
Is there heaven for a savage, is there heaven for a savage?
Bags under my eyes cause I go hard
Probably cost more than the Goyard
Probably why I got a cold heart
Probably why I got to shine cause my life has been so dark, man
Pull up, bring your friend - that's a trio
Show up unannounced like my PO
You know the deal, the batch made her bend over backwards like Neo
I'm crazy but maybe I'm torn aside
I'm talkin' 'bout drugs like I glorify it
The truth is that I'm fuckin' horrified
I only slept twice in like 40 nights
Man, I'm on the back, she on the poltergeist
Man, I should just start takin' my own advice
Cause nowadays love is just overpriced, man

[Hook: Belly]
You must have heard about the re-up
Call me real, ain't you know I be up?
That's the only time you ever free up
I'm not tryna fuck the energy up
She said, baby, please don't get the wrong idea
Roll the tree and fuck this Hennessey up
I come down and start to get ideas
All my demons keep on waking me up



[Verse 1: Belly]
She hit the plane with half a kilo
She turned around and said tranquilo
Tomorrow meet me at mi casa
Just call me when you know que pasa
I think I'm falling for consuela
She's from the slums of Venezuela
No I can't wait until mañana
I fly and meet you in Havana
I'm dressed in black just like mi gente
Like es el dia de la muerte
She's only loyal to el jefe
I bet she taste just like tres leches

[Hook: Belly]
I think I'm falling for consuela
I think I'm falling for consuela
I think I'm falling for consuela
I think I'm falling for consuela

[Verse 2: Young Thug + Zack Kharbouch]
I gave a 'Rari to my brother (skrt-skrt-skrt)
I bought a mansion for my mother (for my mother)
I got like 20 xans, all colors (xannies and percs)
I'ma get these hoes in love for our love
Turned to a boss, I'm writing checks (writing checks)
Got 20,000 VV's on my neck (on my neck)
Turned to a monster, I'm T-Rex
I'm with your wife, no I don't kiss her, hey
She got me running like El Chapo
I took my other bitch to CaboAll she call me is el jefe
Feds asking questions, no comprende (no sabe nada)

[Hook: Belly]
I think I'm falling for consuela
I think I'm falling for consuela
I think I'm falling for consuela
I think I'm falling for consuela

[Verse 3: Belly + Zach Kharbouch]
She love to argue papa fuera
Gave her love but she no quería
She used to sing guantanamera
Diamonds dancing, Macarena
I'm tryna be a caballero
I think she only love dinero
She have some beef and dropped some pesos
That's hamburguesa with the queso

[Hook: Belly]
I think I'm falling for consuela
I think I'm falling for consuela
I think I'm falling for consuela
I think I'm falling for consuela



[Intro: Belly]
Gain the world or lose it all
Gain it back again
Bounce back

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Bounce that, bounce that, bounce that, bounce that, bounce that, bounce back
Bitch I run the whole check up then I bounce back
My lil' baby like to get on top and bounce it
Run it back up on that ass when she bounce it
You know I brought a whole pound
Bitch I'm the man in my town
Bitch I spent that whole check and then I bounce back
I run this back up on that ass

[Verse 1: Belly]
All we had was thorns in the rose garden
No calm before the storm warning
Cold mornings made us cold hearted
My dawg could whip a fuckin' brick on a George Foreman
The shit that drives me would drive you crazy don't try to save me
Rock fly Versace and drive Mercedes the modern '80s
I'm kinda crazy, paranoid my driver shady
I'm at the lowest and my highest lately
I was dodgin' evictions
Couldn't afford my addictions
With my father in prison
Family poverty stricken
Felt like we all got convicted
No one bothered to visit
Livin' in awful conditions
Still put my dawgs in position, like woah woah
We worship money like this shit was religion but no no
'Cause once I got it felt like something was missin' my whole soul
Three stacks for a loud pack
Not bad for a outkast
Pulled up in that big boy
Never thought I would bounce back

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Bounce that, bounce that, bounce that, bounce that, bounce that, bounce back
Bitch I run the whole check up then I bounce back
My lil' baby like to get on top and bounce it
Run it back up on that ass when she bounce it
You know I brought a whole pound
Bitch I'm the man in my town
Bitch I spent that whole check and then I bounce back
I run this back up on that ass

[Verse 2: Belly]
My bitch pull up like Joan of Arc, the coldest heart
Belly Bonaparte my dawgs'll pick your fuckin' bones apart
To ride this wave you need Noah's Ark and his golden heart
Wait, I bear the holy mark although my soul is dark
A sleepless night for every promise I would never keep
Ten thousand on sheets although I never sleep
I'm havin' day dreams of eatin' you out
My face is the best fuckin' seat in the house
Wait, no sympathy we take it religiously
I took your bitch to Tiffany she had an epiphany
Trips to Tripoli don't trip we do this shit differently
The sound of victory, I almost drowned in the symphony
Now tell these fuckin' house rats, me I got the mouse trap
Load and cock it back and tell 'em all to meet me out back
Three stacks for that loud pack
Not bad for a outkast
Pulled up in that big boy
Never thought I would bounce back

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Bounce that, bounce that, bounce that, bounce that, bounce that, bounce back
Bitch I run the whole check up then I bounce back
My lil' baby like to get on top and bounce it
Run it back up on that ass when she bounce it
You know I brought a whole pound
Bitch I'm the man in my town
Bitch I spent that whole check then I bounce back
I run this back up on that ass



[Hook]
She would do for a pair of shoes or a row of pearl
With these superficial girls
In this artificial world
Hollywood
La la la la la la la
If you knew what it would take to love me down
You would turn back around
And I'd return to this two-faced town
Hollywood
La la la la la la la
Hollywood
La la la la la la la
Hollywood

[Verse]
I take this bottle from the shelf go straight to bottom where all my demons dwell
She said welcome to Hell where you can scream but they won't hear you yell
On the first train to Hollywood
Train to Hollywood
To go find someone else
Baby I can be what you need
Be what you need
Cause I don't feel like myself
La la la la la la
Oh no, I don't feel like myself
La la la la la la

[Hook]
She would do for a pair of shoes or a row of pearl

[Verse 1: Belly]
You used to hit my phone to make a dick appointment
Used to tell me he was nothing but a disappointment
Used to watch him suffer for your own enjoyment
And he would send you checks for nothing like its unemployment
Back to the streets that I roam like Caesar's home
I sleep alone don't need a throne to each his own
She's cold my sheets cold I dream alone
Invested in her but now she'd rather be alone
I keep a black rose that in the back of a black Rolls
That I use like a black hearse no church just black clothes
Hold up, I lay back and took the last sip
I told her my dick taste like the last bitch
Pic reveal, this shit is real
And if these drugs don't kill me I swear these bitches will
Your picture on my windowsill I just get the chills
But somethin's missin' from the picture still

[Hook: Belly & Ashanti]
Layin' in this bed I don't even sleep
Summer come around we don't even speak
Say you goin' away I don't even reach ya
Seven day love got me feelin' weak
Oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord

[Verse 2: Belly]
I used dream about her even fiend about her
Bad bitches she got a team around her
I was the plug when she needed power
I show up and her leaning like the Pisa tower
Life's a bitch and you can't play in fate
Then she broke my heart and left a band-aid
I wish we fell in love with our eyes closed
Say the word and I'ma show up with the blindfolds
Flexin', you always flexin' fuck all your exes
You in the baller section tryna teach us all a lesson
So I don't bother calling you don't bother textin'
Ironically I think I get the message

[Break: Ashanti]
Hey
I haven't heard from you in a while
I just want to say
I just pray that you stay safe

[Hook: Belly & Ashanti]
Layin' in this bed I don't even sleep
Summer come around we don't even speak
Say you goin' away I don't even reach ya
Seven day love got me feelin' weak
Oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord


[Outro]
To answer your life goals before anything else
I love you

[Hook: Belly & Ashanti]
Layin' in this bed I don't even sleep
Summer come around we don't even speak
Say you goin' away I don't even reach ya
Seven day love got me feelin' weak
Oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord



[Verse 1]
I say I'm goin' ham but it's against my religion
Came in this bitch, never ask for permission, uh
Mix it, sip it, drink it, try to think it over and you'll prolly overthink it, uh
Am I trippin', sh, listen, sh grown men talkin' like bitches
These days I can barely even tell the difference
Hate in their blood like a motherfuckin' sickness
Wet pussy drippin', got 'em all slippin'
And you wanna act livid cause we all livin'
There's enough to go around, we can all get it
And they say small world, I say large prison
I'm a savage I've been actin' vicious
All this money got me actin' different
I just need a pack of bad bitches, that'll blast for me like they sacrilegious

[Hook]
Lately I'ma savage I've been actin' vicious
They say this money got me actin' different
They say this money got me actin' different
They say this money got me actin' different
I fell in love with this shit, got myself addicted
You can't complain about the pain, when it's self inflicted
I'm talking jealous friends, these selfish bitches
They say this money got me actin' different
Oh Lord

[Verse 2]
You must be from Hell for Heaven's sake
She make holy water evaporate
I might eat the pussy for half a date
Revenge got a better aftertaste
24/7 my mama pray
12 never ever cracked a case
I'm crackin' cases to celebrate
Money is all I will ever chase
Talking birds, ooou you say that you selling weight
You know we call that shit feather weight
I snap on everything Velous made
Opportunity knock, I answer the door in my robe and my socks
She take some shoes for the pussy
You sell your soul for the box

[Hook]
Lately I'ma savage I've been actin' viscous
They say this money got me actin' different
They say this money got me actin' different
They say this money got me actin' different
I fell in love with this shit, got myself addicted
You can't complain about the pain, when it's self inflicted
I'm talking jealous friends, these selfish bitches
They say this money got me actin' different
Oh Lord



[Intro: Sampled]

[Verse 1: Belly]
Screamin' 'til we overdose
I almost did the other day
You can't handle what you're seein'
Baby, you should look away
I was laying in the kitchen
Shit, I didn't even pray
Smile all on my face
This the shit that I embrace
Boy, I blow a quarter million
Got it just the other day
So addicted to prescriptions
And these dirty concentrates
I been poppin', I been sippin'
I been smokin' all day
Half a trip away, I'm a doctors slip away

[Hook: Belly]
Why you feel so different to me
Something feels so different to me
(You know, you know)
Maybe you’re just trippin' like me (I know, I know)
Honestly I can't feel a thing (you know, you know, you know)
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me

[Verse 2: Belly]
So the story goes, baby
Bitches come and go
You don't even love me when the batch is runnin' low
Nevermind, you were never mine, that's a lie
Money made you blind
I can see it in your eyes
Getting high every 45 minutes
Man it's somethin' else
Pop a couple Adderall
Wash it down with percocet
Think I need some padded walls
Leaning just in case I fall
Only cheap liquor left
Smell like rubbin' alcohol

[Hook: Belly]
Why you feel so different to me?
Different to me
Something feels so different to me
(You know, you know)
Maybe you’re just trippin' like me (I know, I know)
Honestly I can't feel a thing (you know, you know, you know)
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me

Everybody 'round me sayin' I should relax, cause
I've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll backward
All I wanna do is forget about my past, and
Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
Probably cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back, but
I'mma let it slide cause my niggas too violent
Shout-out to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack
Then I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone

[Hook: The Weeknd]
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not

[Verse 2: Belly]
Bitches know, told a ho, "It's different strokes for different folks"
Came up out the north, we was playin' with a different snow
Took my niggas from the 401 to Pacific Coast
We no longer put no fish scale on the fishin' boat
Listen ho, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke
I know all you bitches want is dick and dough
Told her, "You don't gotta make it difficult"
Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
Hippy bitches sendin' me titty pictures
She told me no religion was the new religion
She said she don't believe in God but her shoes Christian
I heard she servin' everybody like the soup kitchen
Gettin' hoes higher, gettin' hoes higher
She got work in the mornin', I'm gettin' hoes fired
Why the fuck you call it purp when you mix it pink?
You know I fuckin' mix the drinks when the shit's too strong

[Hook: The Weeknd]
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not

[Outro: Belly]
('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)
I might not make it, oh no I might not make it
('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)
I might not make it, oh no, I might not make it
('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)
I might not make it, oh no I might not make it
('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)
I might not make it, oh no, I might not make it (Ooh)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times, then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance, turn this shit into a nightclub

Turnt-turnt up, yeah, I need Camila in the group (group, group)
Paper up, double pumpin', big with the loot (loot, loot)
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, million cash in a safe
French Vanilla by the case, fuck the cuffs, where my bracelet?
Frenchy is the name, CB is the gang
Let's call the boys, call a couple planes
R-r-ring on like a mason
Her pussy wet, cash long, Kyrie with the mask on
Keep a hunnit, come and get some hunnits
Fuck, fuck with me and get some money
We gon' make it disappear, David Copperfield
Drop top on the Ville like a lobster tail
Talk the best, box free like Akinyele
Talk 'bout the best bitch for a happy meal

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, ayy, yeah, fuck with me and get some money
Yeah, in Miami partying with Puffy
Ayy, she want to fuck, I told her bring her buddy
Ayy, yeah, suck a- suck a dick or something
Yeah, what's understood ain't gotta be explained
Ayy, strippers at 11 keep me entertained
Money dance, money dance, just to make it rain
Yeah, third album, nothing was the same
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, A-$-A-P
I come from The Bay where the cuddies say "Yee"
Touchdown in the town, I'm as big as KD
See NBA money, plant a fucking money tree, ayy
Diamonds, crystal geyser
Big body, that 488's wider
Pulling up like along came a spider
The fourth time I put a baby inside her
Young Gerald

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times, then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her

Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance, turn this shit into a nightclub

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Slob on my knob, like corn on the cob
I break a bitch, like Chyna did Rob
Put a ho to work like she went and got a job
Everybody hit man, welcome to the mob (Mafia!)
Pull up another whip or something, yeah, a different one
Fuck up another VIP or something, I've been killing 'em
Smoke another zip or something, Billy Kimbered up
Take another sip or some, I ain't lit enough
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, got them guns in my Wraith
Got them ones everywhere, she got them buns in my face
I got girls on the pole, like they tryna win a race
Free that nigga Tay K, I just got another case
We get drugged up, and tear the club up
You too boring for the bitch, get your funds up
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, all these diamonds in the face
Fuck around and turn that bitch to Stevie Wonder
Yeah, ho!

[Post-Chorus: Belly]
Fuck with B and get some money (Belly)
Fuck with B and get some money (it's me!)
Fuck with B and get some money
Uhh

[Verse 4: Belly]
Screaming "uhhh"; Master P
Baby, that ass looking like a masterpiece
Used to open doors with a half a key
Fishscale by the whale, call it catch release (aw yeah)
No limit to it, no limit
I'm still with the go-getters and the gorillas
Old paper got me dressed up like a dope dealer
Like a wholesale of money, smellin' like a co-seller (yee)
It ain't safe (no)
Turkey bags on me, I ain’t giving thanks (hello)
Shoe box for my very first bank (hello)
I might pull up on your court with the tank (no limit!)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times, then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance, turn this shit into a nightclub

Big suitcases like we play the cello
Sleeping on me, get a bigger pillow
Live fast, die young just like Barrichello

She mix the red and white wine like the Catalina (She do it)
You call her a stripper, that's my ballerina (Oh God)

White girl, for the white girl, they get all excited
Got enough in here to get us all indicted
Call up your girls, yeah they all invited
All I really need is your undivided
Undivided, undivided
All I really need is your undivided
Undivided, undivided
All I really need is your undivided

[Verse 1: Belly]
45 minutes just to wash it off your skin
You ain't even throw the pussy, what the fuck you offerin'?
It could be a thousand bitches, I'ma tell 'em all, "Come in"
When all I really need is you, you
You, she don't chase liquor and won't chase niggas neither
You, she don't take pictures, can't take bitches neither
Me on that 401, 500 cash in the trunk like I'm on the run
I signed to Black 'fore they won
S'posed to be 50, the plug said there's more to come
But you kept it one on one
Promise whenever we ball it's a one on one
You are a one of one
Pick up the pieces whenever I come undone
Whenever I fall like the summer done, faded 'til I fall over
Even when my heart cold like fall over, you still fall over
And over again, and over, and over again
And over again, even though I'm gone with the wind
You'll probably say I'm wrong, I'm a dog to the end
I'm a dog to the end, I'm a dog to the end
And I ain't make the song to offend
So it's okay to sing along with your friends

[Hook: Travis Scott]
White girl, for the white girl, they get all excited

All I really need is your undivided

[Verse 2: Belly]
She been around the world, never paid a flight
Told her stay tonight, I won't change your life
I just blame the life, blame these faded nights
She said, "Yeah, alright, that don't make it right"
But that don't make it wrong
Wanna talk about love? I'll play along
It's Dablo ho, don't you say it wrong
You got that shit I've been waitin' on
And I'ma fuck you in my own pace
Get some head now, pussy later on
Head now, pussy later on
Get a little head now, pussy later on
Bunch of white girls 'bout to start fuckin'
Penthouse lookin' like a Starbucks

[Hook: Travis Scott]
White girl, for the white girl, they get all excited
Got enough in here to get us all indicted

I said show me somethin' cause these hoes be frontin'
But they got nothin' on you
Pussy so good, make me turn around
Yeah you know that I bust it up, you

And she always reppin' that U
And I fuck with less than a few

I learned this game to a tee all because of you
Now I'm buyin' V, celebratin' all these Ws
Been in the zone for the cameras
First time I met her, shit we was gone in Atlanta
Almost died but it made us feel alive with each other
So we by the lights cause we be high on each other

Missin' cause of you
And I don't know why I'm so goddamn persistent
Over you

Now I'm tryna come up with reasons
For why I'm feining for you
It might not mean nothin' to you
Havin' it to fuckin' on you
Gotta give it up to you

Cause I

[Hook: Belly & Travis Scott]
All these bitches come and go
All this money come and go
I'm just tryna double up
Stack it up just to blow it
Watch the money go
Watch the money go
We been trappin' on the phone
We been whippn' on the stove
She make millions on the pole
Where that money go
Where that money go
Can’t fuck with my team
We need like 100 money machine
Pay the price for these dreams
Where the money go
Where the money go (where the money go)
Where the money go
Where the money go (where the money go)

You can find out where the money
When you find it then you let me know


[Verse 1: Belly]
Lost everything my mind included
Got betrayed today they pray to judas
In a daze, they say my days are numbered
Under fire but I remain the coolest
Where's the love, I hate to have to do this
King shit I think I’m back to rule it
Kill a king ya really feel the power
Hang the backstabber, kill the coward
Dopeamine I’m raw as coca leaf
Out of focus, they can’t hope to see
Bitches talk but I just don’t believe
Adam told us there's no hope for eve
Give a bitch the fuckin' moon and stars
Probably say that all she need is space
Now it's fuck her, I just feed the snakes
This the last supper jesus ate


[Hook: Belly & Travis Scott]
All these bitches come and go
All this money come and go
I'm just tryna double up
Stack it up just to blow it
Watch the money go

You can find out where the money
When you find it then you let me know


[Verse 2: Belly]
Smoke my thoughts and drink my fears
Pray to god but I don’t think he hears
Water muddy, but the crystal's clear
Case I need to make it crystal clear
Heart cold, but I don’t got no chill
Me and Satan we don’t got no deal
Everybody comin' for this dope
I think I might know how Chapo feels
They condemn the child that lives within
Then condemn the way we live as sin
Say I’m haunted, sipping triple gin
When I just wanna see my niggas win, DAMN
I just wanna see my niggas win
I just wanna see my niggas win


[Hook: Belly & Travis Scott]
All these bitches come and go
All this money come and go
I'm just tryna double up
Stack it up just to blow it

[Intro: Young Thug]
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Verse 1: NAV]
I used to hate going back to class in the same clothes
Now, I don't wear shit twice 'cause popping tags is all I know
She said, "You've been gone for too long, I know that you been fucking hoes"
But I been in the studio 'cause chasing bags is all I know
Me and Metro popping addys, been up for four nights in a row
All you gotta do is text the addy and I'ma fill this bitch with dope
Everytime I show off I want a hundred or better for a show
Used to have one pair of Jordans
Now I wear designer on my toes
Remember that bitch ain't wanna fuck me
Now I got a phone that be filled up with hoes
I used to have to wear the same shirt
Now I got a closet full of clothes
Most of my homies still doing dirt and they on the road selling dope
Body can't even cross over the border, said he wanna join me on the road

[Pre-Chorus: NAV]
All this money got you in your feelings
I just copped a coupe took off the ceiling, oh yeah
When you leave town, your bitch can't wait to see me (see me)
You know everything about me, you wanna be me, oh yeah

[Chorus: NAV]
I blew a check, you know
I bought a whip, you know
I fucked your bitch, you know
I'm getting rich, you know
Bought a ice chain, you know
Bought designer frames and you know
I pop and I sip, you know
Get the bag and I dip, you know

[Verse 2: Belly]
He don't know what to do with it
Heard it only go two minutes
You been acting brand new with it
Bitch you know I know who hit it
Girl I'ma fuck you 'til the room spinning
Block hot, you was cool with it
New crib with the pool in it
Shit ain't the same without you in it
Always knew you would switch on me
Thought my mind was playing tricks on me
Before the Rolls and the big Rollies
I was big homies' big homie
Cage me up, I turn Mick Foley
15 with the bricks on me
Millionaire with the stick on me
Got the sauce, got the drip on me
Versace sweater, Gucci links on it
Mink rug, spilling drinks on it
I was broke just the other day
This type of shit make you think, don't it?
I made a list of all the hoes I hit
Stoner shit just so I don't forget
Once I really get a hold of it
I ain't ever letting go of it (No!)

[Pre-Chorus: NAV]
All this money got you in your feelings
I just copped a coupe took off the ceiling, oh yeah
When you leave town, your bitch can't wait to see me (see me)
You know everything about me, you wanna be me, oh yeah

[Chorus: NAV]
I blew a check, you know
I bought a whip, you know
I fucked your bitch, you know
I'm getting rich, you know
Bought a ice chain, you know
Bought designer frames and you know
I pop and I sip, you know
Get the bag and I dip, you know



[Intro]
Yeah!
Up for days, nigga

[Verse 1]
It's the ones you keep close, that hurt you the most
I'm drinking on my own, doing a personal toast
Probably fucked your bitch, and you ain't even know it
I should probably wash my dick with detergent and soap
Ridin' round the city with my vision blurry
Back to back Benz's, nigga his and hers
Million dollar pussy, you should get insured
I hit the town and watch the city burn
Had the keys, had the city locked
Hit the pussy do the Diddy Bop
Before the beard was all ZZ Top
When me and Sal was eating dinner off a TV box

[Pre-Hook]
Find the cancer, then you cut em' off
See my daddy was a dealer and my momma said it's rubbing off
Somebody tell me what the tunnel costs
Cause I've been burning bridges
Give a fuck how I come across

[Hook]
Said "I love you", that's the drugs talking
Heard em' hating, that's the love talking
Hand to god you left me no option
Swear to god y'all left me no option
Who left the drugs on the table? (who?)
Who left these hoes in my house? (who?)
Who left this dope in my couch?
Ho don't you open your mouth

[Verse 2]
Changed up had the curve from pitching the weight
Either way I'm about to ball like I'm missing the plate
Boy you never touched base, I'm calling you out
Though we never seen you out, you was playing it safe
Call me Judas priest, now she got some new beliefs
Photo shoot in like a week, she won't even eat
Dreams of winning got me losing sleep
Versace sheets just to watch Medusa sleep
Up for days, I've been up for days
Mixin' up the love and hate, that's a double date
Dope wave that’s my lane call me Mr.Bang
Renegade mixing up the batch with the lemonade

[Pre-Hook]
Cut em' off
Seen my daddy was a dealer and my momma said its rubbing off
Somebody tell me what the tunnel costs
Cause I've been burning bridges
Give a fuck how I come across

[Hook]
Said "I love you", that's the drugs talking
Heard em' hating, that's the love talking
Hand to god you left me no option
Swear to god y'all left me no option
Who left the drugs on the table? (who?)
Who left these hoes in my house? (who?)
Who left this dope in my couch? (you?)
Ho don't you open your mouth

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make-believe, rappin' about my own life
Real names kill things, that's that shit I won't write
‘Cause my niggas still sellin' dope
Like they ain't on their third strikes
Campin' out in that corridor
Fuck you waitin' on Jordans for?
I middle-man it for twenty-three
Just meet me somewhere 'round Baltimore
(Woo!) That's rare, nigga (Woo!) Ric Flair, nigga
(Woo!) The power's in my hair, nigga
(Woo!) I give this beat the chair, nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes: trifecta
Dope money, hope money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write
Trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit
Ungrateful niggas I don't like—rrrah!

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
(This Chicago, nigga!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound: that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathin' like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I'd never hit a woman, never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife'
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eatin' good: vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissin' girls ‘cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on, then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hangin' out that window: it's about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man, that nigga nice
Shoutout to L.E.P., Jay Boogie, right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? Right?!

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
Don't like, don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
(Young Chop on the beat)

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Fake Gucci, that's that shit that I don't like
Smokin' on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screamin', "Sosa, that's that nigga that I like!"
I don't want relations, I just want one night
‘Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm ‘cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes ‘cause I'm livin' life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealin' light
Bitch, I'm high off life, got me feelin' right
Bitch, I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like!
And, bi-bi-bitch, we GBE, we just go on sight

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
We are not one and the same
Nigga, I'm fuckin' insane, fuck is you sayin'?
Yo' ass been doin' the same
Shit, not doin' what you sayin'
Dang, I told yo' old bitch she was fuckin' a lame
Turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holdin' that pain
I just hope you been prayin'—bang bang!
Ridin' for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlives
And I run this bitch like it's no lights
Goin' hard the whole night
‘Cause I ain't goin' back to my old life, I promise

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
I done sold purple, I done sold white
Runnin' outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowin' up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em, just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, another thirty for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas!

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like



[Intro: DJ Drama]
We all get caught in our own sins
Sometimes I have to remind myself
That on my worst day
I live like somebody on their greatest
Don't let your demons take you to Hell
Introduce them to Heaven

[Hook: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Look, I got homies in the ground, skeleton and bones
And niggas doing life, they ain't never coming home
They said I wouldn't make it or never see the throne
And my baby mama hate me, ‘cause she said I did her wrong
‘Cause I left, to chase my dream, get it any means
I said that I'll be back, she wasn't listening to me
That back-and-forth arguing was getting in between
I said fuck them other niggas, I go get it with my team
If we all grind, we all shine, fuck a part time
I used to play the block early morning and dark time
Now it's G5 flights, fuck a depart time
It was hard times, nigga, now it's our time
Just take a look at my life, rappin' brought me back to life
‘Cause I was in them streets
My heart was cold as a pack of ice
Every night we strappin' like we was in Iraq to fight
‘Cause niggas getting murdered
For a block that do a stack a night
Whoa, I got to make it home to my son
On them papers with a firm hold on his gun
Before I snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
In boiling water, in the world of no order
In the hood, ain't no loyalty, ain't no world for your daughter
Ain't no life for your brother, on the life of my mother
I'ma get the fam right, nigga, you damn right

[Hook: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, I used to pop a lot of shit, now I keep it moderate
These niggas know I been iced out, hopping outta shit
Right now I'm praying for my son to get this scholarship
A nice university, one of these black colleges
Far as the hood go, I acknowledge it
But whoever ain't a snake usually a follower
Luckily, I can tell the difference
My man coming home, my other man getting sentenced
Soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hating on your pictures
We dream-chasin', y'all niggas walkin' behind wishes
Without workin' for it, not often you find riches
Some niggas find coffins, others just find ditches
Just ask around 'bout the militia, they malicious
D-block, finish that and cop more dope
I'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Ain't nothing all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand that'll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Some niggas need a headshot, some niggas need two
Play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
You can't see the devil, he's see-through

[Hook: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, nobody want to kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody want to lose, nobody want to fail
Nobody want to die, we're just tryna live our life



[Produced by StreetRunner & DJ Khaled]

[Intro: DJ Khaled & Anthony Hamilton]
Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Scarface]
Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surroundings when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dog's got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pane to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures say them words we ain't trying to stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm stunned thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For the money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families, these motherfuckers ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepare for the payback cause it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

[Bridge: John Legend]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable
He fuck around, jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
To really figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites, that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, no chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
You was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kits, old Schnitzer's
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh ohh
There's a story in me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't into making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action, they grab him, he take the stand
Damn, say loyalty make a man
Got a homie and he told, I don't even shake his hand
I don't even crack a smile, knew him since a child
Man this game so foul but niggas made vows
To a code I never break, ridin' in the heavyweight
Thirty-six O's in a bird, call it featherweight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved, they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on, clip full
If he got the money, we attack him like a pit bull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

[Bridge: Akon]
My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I know)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day

[Hook: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you, which I will never do)

[Bridge: John Legend & Anthony Hamilton]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world) cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close
Are the ones that'll take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cooooold) a cold cold world

[Hook: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you)
Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you, which I will never do)

[Breakdown: Akon & Anthony Hamilton]
Ohh-ohhh ohhh-whooooa
Ohh-ohhhh (ohh-ohhhh) ohh-ohhhhh

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton, Akon & John Legend]
See there's a story in my life (hey) (surrender)
There's a story in my pain (hey) (surrender)
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh ohh (surrender)
There's a story in me
I won't surrender, I won't surrender, ohh no no no



[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Catch you out in traffic, it's you and I
Gold 41 in a suit and tie, nigga it's do or die
Seen it now, if I lose it all like who would ride?
But nigga I'm so up, if I tripped it's like suicide
When the internet told me I'm crucified
They was in them streets like, "Nigga you super live"
I was on the block when you was a sneakerhead
Nigga it's a check up in that box, ain't no shoe inside
Nigga ain't no Nike, ain't no Yeezy, no Jordan V
I came back like I'm Mike wearin' 45
Ever seen 50 grand when it's all in 5s?
But I'm shootin' like the Warriors' startin' 5, swish!
Only rapper went gold without a verse from Hov
Still got the rock with me, cookin' up at the stove
And the Rollie all platinum, know I bust it at Joe
Maybach in the hood, so them suckers can know
I'm in the 6, man, 6 man, Dion Waiters
And I'm on my level now, I'm so beyond haters
Bout to go and grab the Benz truck, see y'all later
When I came through the block, you should've seen y'all faces
This is slaughter, new world order
I be goin' hard, Westbrook, 4th quarter
This is hip-hop, you ain't write it, don't record it
I don't know how they gettin' down 'cross the border
I give 'em the dirty flow, Michigan and water
Sent them 10 thousand cases, I put in my order
Call that poppin' bottles when my people can't afford it
Mixin' D'usse with lemonade when I'm in Georgia
Views from the projects, and nigga I'm the prospect
Talkin' loud, say I'm shootin' out with metal objects
And that chick standin' right beside you, I done popped that
Made me beat a fan up, I'm feelin' like I'm Artest, woo!
Gold mic from the billboards, 'bout to plug it up
Tell Cruz put it in the booth so I can fuck it up
Got the hood super lit, jumpin' like it's double dutch
From the bottom like an uppercut, now I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
You niggas all the way fucked
Switched sides, now you stuck (stay over there my g)
Fuck them niggas though

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
They don't wanna see you on top
I just wanna see the streets up
They don't wanna see you up
That's it
They gon' take shots when you all the way up
I guess they gotta aim up at you
But don't you let these nobodies get their name up on you
Keep the circle tight, never let 'em lame up the crew
If she for everybody, don't you let her claim up on you
Now listen, you gave up on me, I came up on you
Took my talents somewhere else, LeBron James up on you
I was Kyrie with the rock, the crack game number 2
Now I'm older, still ballin' like my name Uncle Drew
They tell you... stay the same, but they change up on you
Niggas change up the crew like hoes change up their boo
I just played the cards they dealt me 'til a change-up was due
Guess I had to switch the dealer or just change up the shoe
Now blackjack, Ace of Spade and a shot of Jack
I met a bad actress, she ain't know how to act
I took her but I brought her back
Don't want her back, I bought her bag
Matte like Hasselbeck, I call my car a quarterback
If I threw it at her would you doubt she could catch?
She hang like a chain so she 'bout to get snatched
Ain't about throwin' subs, I'm about gettin' scratches
But if the shoe fits, nigga, buy an outfit to match it
And you know my boys hold it, we be out with the ratchets
I heard your boys told her you be out with the rats
Keep that on the "Shhhh!”, nothing less, nothing more
I know the Bad Boys in Brooklyn, they ain't with the Puffy tour
What's up with your Warriors? They ain't lookin' tough no more
Should get out your feelings bro, and get in your duffle, boy
Level up, level up, it's all about that level up
Hold that fuckin' bezel up and light this bitch all the way up

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Meek called me and Fab, Joe called Jigga up
She jumped in the 6, 550 wasn't big enough
Reason niggas die, they don't know how to live enough
They can tread water, but they can't swim enough
Nah, I'm built for the physical outing
Besides that, I'm filthy, like municipal housing
J all I know is 500, getchu a thousand
I be in all the hood spots you not allowed in
Opps in the building, automatically alert that
Hand on the wrist so the chrome don't jerk back
Pull it out, you already know you gotta squirt that
I'm all the way up I'm from where the phones don't work at
You gon' need the key from the lobby to slide up
You don't know the key to the body is mind up
Born with it then you don't gotta get signed up
Gotta go when you gotta go, your times up
Extendos, no need for keeping the 9's tucked
I'm kicking you off the ladder for trying to climb up
Yup, overlooking the city
I'm all the way up, I'm like Hov looking at Biggie
It's 50 in the bank, who rollin'? Shoot the 50
If I ace, then these niggas think they hit me
But I'm all the way up

[Outro]
All the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
All the way up
And everytime you see me nigga
Man I'm all the way up



[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets?
Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in debt?
And why them dudes ain't ridin' if they part of your set?
And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death?
Yeah, and why they gonna give you life for a murder?
Turn around, only give you eight months for a burner?
It's goin' down; why they sellin' niggas' CD's for under a dime?
And if it's all love, daddy, why you come with your 9?
Why my niggas ain't get that cake?
Why is a brother up north better than Jordan
That ain't get that break?
Why you don't stack instead of tryin' to be fly?
Why is rattin' at an all time high? Why are you even alive?
Why they kill 2Pac and Chris?
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin' Cris?
Why them bullets have to hit that door?
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw? Why'd he kiss that whore?
Why?!

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
All that I’ve been given
Is this pain that I’ve been livin'
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why? Oh why?
Why they gotta do me like that?

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Why do niggas push pounds and powder?
Why did Bush knock down the towers?
Why you around them cowards?
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight?
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari?
Why he take that bike?
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail?
Why they stop lettin' niggas get degrees in jail?
Why you gotta do 85% of your time?
And why do niggas lie in 85% of they rhymes?
Why a nigga always want what he can't have?
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag?
Why did crack have to hit so hard?
Even though it's almost over, why niggas can't get no jobs?
Why they come up with the witness protection?
Why they let the Terminator win the election?
Come on, pay attention!
Why I sell in the stores what you could sell in the streets?
Why I say the hottest shit but be sellin' the least?

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
All that I’ve been given
Is this pain that I’ve been livin'
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why? Oh why?
Why they gotta do me like that?

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar?
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it?
Why they didn't make the CL6 with a clutch?
And if you don't smoke
Then why the hell you reachin' for my dutch?!
Why rap? ‘Cause I need air time
Why be on the curb with a "Why lie? I need a beer" sign?
Why all the young niggas is dyin'?
‘Cause they moms at work
They pops is gone, they livin' with iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for AIDS?
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days?
Why you screamin' like it's a slug? It's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York?
Why they forcin' you to be hard?
Why ain't you a thug by choice?
Why the whole world love my voice?
Why? Try to tell 'em that it's the flow, son
And you know why they made the new twenties?
‘Cause I got all the old ones — that's why!

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
All that I’ve been given
Is this pain that I’ve been livin'
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why? Oh why?
Why they gotta do me like that?



[Hook: Tyga]
I said fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga I hit em up

[Verse 1: Tyga]
T Raww go stay Westside, killa cap peela,
No ceiling, probably worth 10 million
Poor nigga watch chilla, you ain't even gotta feel it
That's chin chinchilla flyer than a caterpillar
I sick my dogs at you, yeah
They ain't call the dog catcher, bitch
Spark the fire, no matches, yeah
So high just laughing, hah
Burners in the attic, they ain't know I had it
Shoot sporadic, fire automatic, pop the target
Driving backwards, I'm a hundred bill fanatic
Bring the static, make vows to the money, but I skipped marriage
Keep staring, rather die that nigga than live average, get you embarrassed
Thousand karats on my wheel that my kids inherit
Black card credit, told them I don't use debit
Nigga know that's my motto, I could do this shit forever so

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
We don't rock with them niggas anyway, fuck them
We'd ever caught them in the hood, we'd a stuck them
Things coming in, we get them off by the dozen
We about that action, y'all ain't about nothin'
Girl of your dreams, I already had her
If it ain't my team, it don't really matter
Short stay, I'm only in town for the figures
Even when I'm up, I'm still down for my niggas
Need nothing else, don't concern me or worry me
Nah, I'mma ride 'til they burn me or bury me
Cause the truth is, niggas die every day
Heard about me, I hope you heard thoroughly
I don't switch sides, I just switch rides
Might just get a little head, let the bitch slide
Knowing that I can, knowing that I will
Far as the other side go, you know how I feel

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: 2Pac & Tyga]
You gotta watch your back, stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt, bitch
Walkin' through the streets wearin' jewels
Ain't got shit to lose
Gonna fuck up and bust young niggas with tools
The intricate designs of my lethal lines
Now time hard to find a job, easier to rob niggas
These days, motherfuckers talk shit, and turn snitch when you see 'em
They ain't talkin' 'bout shit, Westside
I keep a vest on my chest, bitch
Buck, buck, cops wanna hit me with the book
But I don't give a fuck, government got a nigga feelin' stuck
While these same little sluts gettin' fucked for a quick buck
Weed make my mind roam
All alone, ain't nothin' like tryna bone
Over the phone, in my mind I can see her naked
I can't take it, got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew, bitch
Get loaded, can't control it
Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it
Then smoke it, sipping Hennessy, plottin' on my enemies
Comin back twice as hard like, remember me
My hustle to my dyin' days, niggas dyin' every day
And we celebrate with pain, pourin' champagne
Street politics, they wanna join my campaign
Worldwide, LA niggas screaming Westside

[Hook x2]



[Intro: Fabolous]
Niggas got me on my Brooklyn shit, aye, what I told 'em? I said
Bein' hot get you the MVP, stayin' hot get you the hall of fame
It's Loso, Brooklyn forever, Shmurda, what up, son?
Brooklyn, what up, son? Huh?

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yo, I hit my shmoney dance when I caught the lick
I hit my shmoney dance when I caught ya chick
I Bobby Shmurdered that when she came 'round
Threw the hat up in the air, it never came down
And I just caught that body like a week ago
Real quick, click clack, get to freakin', hoe
She want some hot nigga chillin' out in Mykonos
Or thot niggas all summer, every weekend, hoe
I ain't no killer but don't push me, yo
I had 'em killers in yo bushes, yo
Them trick niggas splurge on the pussy, yo
You give me one day, I'll Purge on that pussy, yo
You ain't seen these kicks since like the fifth grade
Back when Bo Jackson and Ken Griffey played
On my 90s flow, nigga, Young OG shit
On my GSC, Meet the Family shit

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Can't hold you forever, you gon' get a date
Tell 'em free my nigga Critter Mate
Hold ya head to all my niggas in the state
D-Block, GS9, nigga, get it straight
Got the semi and fully on me
Gloves, mask and a hoodie on me
'Case we need to steal a V, I got the pully on me
I know you shocked, right? They got me on bully, homie
It's fake love 'cause they really hatin'
For my downfall, they really waitin'
Hundred yardies, a hundred Haitians
I'm a hot nigga by affiliation

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Look, fresh up out the county, I done did a lil bid
Let the popos run up on me, I won't tell them coppers shit
All this money in my pocket, you might think I sold a brick
I got four hoes and some Hen', some low pros on my Benz
And if I catch that nigga slippin', I'ma shut him down
Let my homies separate his body, call that Seven Pounds, better cool out
I'm nice with the hands, you keep talkin' that shit, I'll knock you out
A nigga be pickin' you up off of the ground for thinkin' you 2Pac
And shawty give me neck 'til I pass out
And she just gettin' checks 'cause her ass out
Makin' money, gotta be the fast route
Bitch, if you ain't fuckin', better get yo ass out

[Verse 4: Rowdy Rebel]
Pow, pow, that chopper make him Diddy Bop
Free Slice Billy, let my billy rock
And free A-billi, let A-billi out
When Flex drop a bomb on us, watch the city rock
Made Diddy shmoney dance right on Biggie block
Make him bring a hundred bands and the city out
When French pull up in that brand new Yacht
Watch me slide off with ya thot 'cause I'm worth about a milli now
Niggas think 'cause we dancin' 'round, niggas won't get shot
That's Bobby Shmurda, not Bobby Brown, known to pop up on the block
These pussy niggas better calm it down, get the same drop from that thot
And these fuck niggas don't come around 'cause they know they gon' get shot

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Fuck around and get ya shit popped
Like hangin' out too long on 91st and Winthrop
See, you the type to probably get got
See, this where all the fuckery nigga shit stop
Shawty climb this money mountain to the tip-top (get it)
Throw a hundred fifty on my wrist (watch)
Stayed with the heat, they call me Chris Bosh
Angry 'cause niggas see me leavin' the bitch block
Shout my nigga Web, shout my nigga Luger
Free my nigga Smiles, free my nigga Scooter
I suggest you probably pray to Buddha
Conglomerate and GS9 niggas full of shooters

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Let's talk about a hot nigga
My dogs'll sit and rot, nigga
Fuck the judge, we never cop, nigga
Who the first to bring that Lambo on the block, nigga?
Poppin' Aces in the studio with Bobby 'nem
Before all the labels started callin' him
'Cause bitch, I understand him 'cause I'm one of them
So know you hatin' on me if you hatin' on 'em
Memphis shooters, that's who we are
Made a million out a glass jar
Cocaine, I got dope bars
My nigga Snootie just caught a gun charge
Fuck a law, we gon' ride strapped, bitch
We be 'bout that beef, fuck that rap shit
And free my nigga Meek, I'm on my Philly shit
And my New York bitch from Dyckman, she Dominican

[Verse 7: Bobby Shmurda]
Grimy savage, that's who we are
Grimy shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so hard
But GS for my Gun Squad
And bitch, if it's a problem, we gon' gun brawl
Shots poppin' out the AR
I'm with Trigger, I'm with Rasha, I'm with A-Raw
Broad daylight and we gon' let them thangs bark
Tell them niggas free Meeshie, hoe
Some way, free Breezy, hoe
And tell my niggas Shmurda teamin', hoe
Mitch caught a body about a week ago
Fuck with us and then we tweakin', hoe
Run up on that nigga, get to squeezin', hoe
Everybody catchin' bullet holes
Niggas got me on my bully, yo
I'ma run up, put that gun on him
I'ma run up, go dumb on him
Niggas got me on that young shit
Got me on that go dumb shit

[Outro: Bobby Shmurda]
Got me on that go dumb shit, man
Trap mode in this motherfucker, hotter than a bitch
Ayo, pour up, I need some more drank



[Part 1: Groovy Tony, Produced by Tae Beast]

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]
Blank Face, tre eight, kill everybody, fuck an AK
Sell narcotics and step my dollars up to Bill Gates
Push all limits, you lookin' timid, need to back off
Punk-ass cops, them crackers want us with our black off
Thug life, nigga since '96 I wanted to gang bang
Few years later I'm really from it, we were still kids
Crack off nigga, I'm squeezing empty 'til the shell break
Fuck my image I need to drop, I need to, Blank Face

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Cause brain damage from my mechanics, keeping two ways
Sell narcotics, I'm slanging diamonds with your pack then
Stack large commas, you with your riders with your backbone
Can't fold figures, I make deposits with the gold grin
Jeans look dirty, I lift the Chevy with the rims on
All bad bitches, they wanna fuck me with the cap gone
Real life nigga, I'm in the stu' 'til all the weed blown
Wait long, long, I hid the dope behind the cellphone
Y'all don't hear me, I want the money right, ugh
Groovy Tony, no face killer, I see the money right, ugh
Blank Face, clear everything out the safe
Crack the pig bank, robbin' your kids too
My heart an igloo, the devil in all blue, huh
Die now, go to Heaven, or bring 'em through
Lot of brown 'round here, got that white girl for you
And she swimming in fire water, could be double digits
Pistol through your Civic
Most die before they hear it, turn a nigga to a spirit
Drive slow, oh, hey
Hit the curb with shattered mirrors
Look around now you're hell bound, boogie down
Bullshit I won't allow, slang a bird every hou'
Smack a nigga with the heat
Contradicting, now you peace
Leave you triple six laying in defeat
Can you dig it?
Struck a match, they won't finish
Drop a nigga off, get a nigga whipped
Squeezing fingertips, aye

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]
Blank Face, tre eight, kill everybody, fuck an AK
Sell narcotics and step my dollars up to Bill Gates
Push all limits, you lookin' timid, need to back off
Punk ass cops, them crackers want us with our black off
Thug life, nigga since '96 I want the gang bang
Few years later I'm really from it, we were still kids
Crack off nigga, I'm squeezing empty 'til the shell break
Fuck my image I need to drop, I need to, Blank Face

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Exactly what I'ma have when the cops come
Body language's the same as when the shots rung
Holding a .38 and a shotgun
Real nigga, we all know you are not one, nah
Running with the rebels, it's a three-man weave
With the Lord and the devil
Really all I need is a pitchfork and a shovel
If I can't proceed then I resort to the metal (Blank Face)
Getting high watching NBA League Pass (Who with?)
With your family at the re-pass (My condolences)
My heart's getting colder
When I hug your mom and look over her shoulder
You notice I got the (Blank Face)
I ain't heard nothing, I ain't seen nothing
I ain't in the middle with nothin', no in between nothin'
F y'all for ever hating me
As I sit there while they interrogate me
I'm staring at 'em with the (Blank Face)
[Part 2: Eddie Kane, Produced by Dem Jointz]

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Top rack nigga and the money came with it, huh
New bitch with me, Hope the booty came with it
Came with it, uh, yeah, rims flying down the road, huh
Five in the morning, feds knockin' on my door, huh
Toilet full of dope, while my burner knee high
Tell me put the gun down, I'm probably gonna die
I know, I know, big guns sell dope
Eddie Kane's little bro, hundred k, one whip, hah

[Bridge 1: Dem Jointz]
Open Eddie Kane for hire
Been tryna get rich for hours
Nights like this I wish
Cocaine drops would fall, woo, woo, woo, woo...

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Yo, uh, yo, uh
Need a car with no mileage
Kristoff on my palate
My cigar full of cabbage
Came from the dirt to the carrots
Getting dirty dollars
Four different baby mommas
Dope between the speakers
So fuck you mister teacher
Cause the paper, I ace it
Lead, they tried to erase it
But I'm still standing
They mad at everything
Nothing given, I'ma take it first
On the trees like a hammock
Flip the work behind the campus
Young Groovy turn your hood into a movie (into a movie...)
Gang bangin', dope slangin'
GTA-ing, shoot the whole club up
Fuck tryna sneak the K in
On the road to riches
Thank you Mister Reagan
You helped them dollars rake in
And to my uncle that fucked up the family
That shit that you was smokin'
I was pushin', residue lie on the cushion
I'ma blame it on your ass cause I ain't gettin' whoopings
And your proof is in the pudding
I'm just grandma's baby, Eddie Kane
(Eddie Kane, Eddie Kane)

[Bridge 2: Dem Jointz]
Standing in the white light
And we on
And is there any other smokers in here?
And we on
And is there any other smokers in here?
And we on
Is there any other smokers in here?
Keys open doors on the road to my heart
Dreams on the floor, bet a nigga stay high
And I know
What makes the world go 'round, go 'round? Woohoo
What makes the world go 'round, go 'round? Woohoo

[Outro: Candice Pillay]
Walk right into the light
Getting a feeling in the night
[?] spice
You're my only Christ
I have only eyes for you
I have only eyes for you
Your soul is mine
Your soul is mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine



[Intro: Mark Morrison]
Return of the mack (x3)
You know that I’ll be back
Return of the mack (x3)
You know that I’ll be back

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T]
Today is the day I get out on my feet
Remove them chains, they shackled on me
Press my luck, stop fucking with them hoes that cluck
Cause the same motherfuckers the ones that got me stuck
Tryna use me up ’til my tank on E
Then leave me stranded, scrambling in these streets
For a dollar a day until my pockets is straight
Soon as you move out the hood them niggas hollering you fake
Make ‘em swallow the bass from the Kicker
I’d rather be a dead man than a nigga
I’d rather roll chrome rims than a swisha
I gotta make moves, I can’t hang with ya
That used to be the fly shit back in ’95
But now I want a crib and a car I can drive
And ain’t nobody out there help me cause I’m grown
Gotta leave them childish games alone
Nigga I’m on

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I’m in the hood still praying for a piece of faith
I know he on his way I’m hoping he don’t make it late
I’m up the bat, I just hope I make it to the plate
I’m Babe Truth you can tell ‘em I’m one of the greats
Used to shoot for the stars now my aim live
I’m the truth nigga something that your name not
A thousand watts ain't a thing that I can’t shine
It ain't a wrist or a chain that I can't rock
Tell ‘em I’m on something like city lights
I used to be out they sights, tinted like city nights
Now a nigga be city to city on plenty flights
You can tell ‘em I put on for my city in plenty fights
Tell ‘em I ain't gon lose they heated like I’mma tan 'em
I’m bout to throw ‘em in this drop with no ceilings so I can fan ‘em
Pull up on the bike same color the Phantom
And jump out on them haters just to tell ‘em I couldn’t stand ‘em

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I’m on top of my game yo
The OG Grand daddy kush, cocaine flow
I’m about that cash not that tango
Head shots, dump a whole clip in ya Kangol
Claim to be a real nigga we know you ain't though
I be in the hood, all the places you can’t go
Visuals, you can see the pictures I paint yo
Residuals, I just put it all in the bank yo, it’s pitiful
Hoes only after your bankroll
Stay off of the phone, watch out for the plain clothes
Yeah I rep my set, I ain't in the gang though
I protect my neck I carry the thing yo
I’m on the same shit that the boss is on
Do it for those in the feds, up north or gone
I’m on a winning streak, I done got my losses on
It’s ironic cause even when I’m off I’m on
Yeah I’m on

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
I’m on
I’m on
I’m on

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
I’m ’bout to cop the Porsche
Eternally grateful for the support, made the cover of The Source
Flashback to the ports the city of no remorse
Where they shooting back and forth like they playing horse
May the force be with you, bullet hit you
You bleed and I bleed with you
Mama please when you grieve damn I grieve with you
This a preview I see you in the summer, my new shit dumber
I’m on

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Life at the bottom is devastating
You’re hardly ever debated, the party is obligated
By suckers that wanna be you and never live with the matrix
And never ever related to struggle and dedication
Your hustle is nominated, anonymous then you faded
The promises that a victory lap is surely awaited
They vomited everytime that a rapper’s annihilated
Just wish them happy belated, fuck you I made it, I’m on

[Verse 6: B.o.B]
Tokyo, Amsterdam, Denver to L.A
Minutes turn to hours and hours to pay
The days turn to nights but the nights never change
It’s funny time is money used to be a turn of phrase
But now it’s company policy
I’m no spokesperson, no tricks, no gimmicks, no coercion
And they say, "Bob, man it’s good to have you back"
But I say, "I’ve been here, where the fuck have y'all been at?"

[Verse 7: Tyga]
Thinking how Pac lived at 22
That's ’93, I was four now I’m 22 on tour
One, two shots of my life, barely hold on
But I’m drawn to this feeling of adrenaline
With mic’s on, lights on and they gon’ applaud
Young nigga, Versace they never seen before
And they gon watch me, copy shit that I got on
I’m too fly, I ain't got a flaw
Tell the law we above the law, God bless, amen every lost soul
And the group so good, went solo
Globe trotting, now I’m blowing up like an afro
Nigga thought you knew what I do
Rolling through ya area, double RR coupe
Penthouse level, now we only party on the roof
Bitch I’m a rebel so I move how I wanna move
Last King, YMCMB

[Verse 8: Gudda Gudda]
Used to run around the hood picking honies up
Now I’m doing shows around the world picking money up
Used to be slept on like a pillow
Went from trapping in a rental to rapping on instrumentals
Now its money on my mental and women get sentimental, huh
It’s cause the flow is sweet as a pack of skittles, nah
Yellow gold, yellow diamonds in the middle, nah
Stand up nigga, I was never known to sit down

[Verse 9: Bun B]
Well as the world spins around and around on its axis
Boys flip from town to town with the package
Stuffing bills and pounds and browns in a mattress
Sending clowns underground for practice
The fact is everybody wanna be the king with the crown
But never in the battle when the drama goes down
Easy to be the boss from behind the wall
But we gon see who really goes down when it’s time to brawl
Cause you gotta be careful about the image you portraying
You gotta show love to where you from all day
And when the going gets rough, don't get to going, get to staying
Put it down for your people and no delaying, know what I’m saying?

[Hook]



[Intro: The Weeknd]
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
But baby lets face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel-crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
I'm good, I'm not living like I did before
I'm good, I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, said I'm good
Oh, I been good
I've been out there puttin' down that work
I'm good, said I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, motherfucker I'm good

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
This is dedicated to everybody who forgot
Forgetful motherfuckers
Remember, don't you remember?
I been good, we good



What does dedication mean to you?

Umm, nowadays, dedication mean to me...umm, the same thing it's meant all the rest of-whatever, same thing it's always meant man. Just get on the mixtape, have fun, enjoy myself. Say things that I wouldn't say on my album or, you know what I mean, say things that I wouldn't on a album. On anyone's album for that case or whatever

Anyway, yeah, dedication still means the same thing: just get on this shit and go crazy and just talk what I want to talk, say what I want to say. And all the people that's featured on the mixtape, shoutout to them anyway. I tell them the same thing, man do what you want, say what you want, let's just have fun, enjoy ourselves, and show people that we could rap. We can make words rhyme. Yeah and it's still dedicated to you fuck-niggas

D5! Whattup 5!?



[Hook]
And if I fuck her, she gon' get attached
Who invited all these fuck-niggas?
Man, shit ain't ever smell this good
Why them snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these niggas, wake me up when it's all over

[Verse 1]
Bitch, come kill my time, but bitch don't steal my shine
I'm cooking up two quarters, bout' to get rich or die tryin'
I got some killer's on my side, some kill up in my swisher
All this hatin' drive me crazy, take the key out the ignition
Oh my god it feel like Coogi weather
I lost my mind, but I got it back like groovy Stella
Tell them hoes I got that Victoria Secret weapon
I hope you live a double life cause you gon' need an extra
Me and my niggas we got bad bitches up in the pool
Bad bitches up in the pool
She gon' learn tonight, call that shit night school
And life is a bitch on her cycle, delightful
Got ho's on that powder, like light blue
Nice move, now king me nigga
Badass bitch, you seen me with her, we on that
GT Vodka, straight out the bottle, genie nigga
The difference between me and these niggas, is
I go hard and they go wrong
She say, "Hit it from the back," I'm tryin' to leave that crack alone baby

[Hook 2]
And if she love me, I'mma love her back
Who indictin' all the tough niggas?
We smoke that skunk that's always smellin' good
But why these snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these nigga's, wake me up when it's all over

[Verse 2]
Street sweepers and millimeters, AK's and skateboards
Let 'em know we got beef for anyone who got a taste for it
Real nigga to the bone, bristle
Cocaine, like co cripple
Heard niggas been waitin' on me, well I might as well go and tip 'em
I'm smokin' on that Hulk Hogan
I call shots, you call forward
I pimp my ride, my car's ho-in'
And all my bars be barcoded
These YMCMB stars glowin'
Hate a ho-nigga, like anchovies
My young bitch keep on snappin' on me, I told that bitch I ain't posing
That pussy feel like a pot of gold
The money old and the night is young
All them niggas keep talkin' shit
I make you eat your words and bite your tongue
And when the guns ring I'm the ring leader
Got those ho's on pins and needles
I'm so high I left Earth
And ran into Venus and Serena
Get head like a mind reader
You washed up, I'm the dry cleaner
Don't worry about me, nigga I'm one-
Hundred like a high fever
Got pounds takin' up closet space
Guns all in my bitch crib
Since all you nigga's fly now, bugs all on my windshield

[Hook 3]
And if she tense, then I'mma rub her back
She alright, I think I fuck with her
Man, I wish a motherfucker would
I feel like a hockey puck nigga
Way too cold to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cold to die young, give these niggas the cold shoulder
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, another bitch when I roll over
We fuck until we fall asleep, wake up and do it all over

[Outro]
D5
What up 5? (Kendrick)
What up 5?



[Verse 1]
I got old money, take a bath in hundreds
My way or the highway and I see traffic comin'
It's Tunechi in this ho, watch them hoes go crazy
Pass that weed around, like that shit contagious
And I got news for all these snitches, tell them feds stop bitching
If pussy lips could talk, I'd go down there like it's whisperin'
You know life is so uncertain and death is so unwanted
My navigation system say it's death around the corner
I got a condo for a stash house, a condo for a stash house
Get that boy a mirror, so he can watch his damn mouth
See I get it from Sosa, he got it from Frank
And Sosa alright, but I'm tryin' to meet Frank
He said business is well, he ain't got no complaints
You'll be Batman and I'll be robbin' the bank
I know I ain't gon' fall, even though I'm power trippin'
Glass house nigga, you see how I'm livin'
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new age
Ain't no such thing as too paid

[Reprise]
Like it's freezing and you naked, shake that ass ho
Shake that ass ho

[Verse 2]
When we throw a pool party, we put sharks in the pool
I got Bloods in the cut, so don't throw salt in the wound
AK wet niggas up, I don't throw water balloons
Better call the platoon
If it's fuck it then fuck it, now you speakin' my language
Put your dead body under them white sheets with no blankets
I'm so rich I go pour
Champagne and don't drink it
Ice on my neck like I fainted
These are the thoughts of the brainless
No new friends, we don't talk to strangers
Man I'm so serious with this pimp shit
Full clip in my Mac 10
Ain't no exit out the game, nigga cut off your blinkers
And if she married I fuck her, if she lonely I fuck her
If she crazy I love her, y'all just don't understand her
She say you got it made, I say no I got a butler
They tell me to turn up, but I'm the knob on the oven
I got a knife in my pocket if there's a fork in the road
I'm the man of steel, but I won't say what I stole
Bring that coke to the stove, and whip it like a new slave
Whip it like a new slave

[Reprise]

[Outro]
D5
Whattup five
Take that coke to the stove
And whip it like a new slave, whip it like a new slave
Like it's freezing and you naked shake that ass ho



Shoutout my nigga Drama, man, for still fuckin' with me with this crazy shit man. Cause obviously he could be like, man, I don't really fuck with you no more, man, I'm doin' this shit without a motherfucker. But he still fucks with your boy and I appreciate that man, I hope we can make the fuckin' computers crash again. Ya dig?



[Intro: Lil Wayne]
My niggas been stuntin' since way back when
CNN, I got news for you haters
I'm a nasty ass nigga, ask your bitch, I ain't lying
69, that's a favor for a favor

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Them hoes bitin' they lip, cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, I hit it all type of ways
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
Niggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a water-park
Every little thing I do turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said, "Tune, not in my mouth," damn you should've said it sooner
I be shittin' on these niggas, like I'm sippin' Metamucil
And we smokin' on that gas, pass it like "excuse you"
And it's 6-6-2's Piru all day, my nigga
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead, my nigga
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be on these bitches' mind
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly
My bitch been fussin' at me about nothin'
Ain't no tellin' what she'd do if I replace her
Like bae, I'm straight, there's plenty fish and I'm bait
We can't even have a decent conversation

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I pop the seal on my sip and she be like, "See, you gon' drink your life away"
Bitch it's my life, my life, my life shout out Mary J
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake
And old folks get shot too, they write down license plates
I hope that ho don't call sayin' her cycle late
All this fucking gotta stop, but I need tighter brakes
And don't run from this dick girl, I don't like to chase
I wax that ass, she make that Mr. Miyagi face
And she ain't all that pretty, but I like her shape
They say numbers don't lie, she shaped like a 8
She say she ain't no dyke, but she gon' dyke today
It's curtains for these niggas I feel like some drapes.
We turnt up niggas, burnt up, stop the microwave
This shit might cost us our life, but that's the price we pay
I'm hotter than the peppers Peter Piper ate
This that Dedication 5, whattup 5?

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Ay Tune' I gotta turn up on the D5 man!
Hustle Gang, bang, green mean, anybody get it
Anything we'll do for the paper
And we live this shit, talk slick get kill't
Got nothin' but a tool for a hater (Spent 100K on my wrist nigga!)
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)
The car I'm drivin' make you feel some type of way (They can't afford this nigga!)
The cash I gettin' make you feel some type of way (Bankrolls-R-Us!)
This type of way, know you feel some type of way (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
That shit ain't hot, we out here poppin' that's all I can say (G.D.O.D!)
My only problem is tryin' to decide what I'mma drive today (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
We shine all in they face, I know they feel some type of way
I wake up in a multi-million dollar crib get dressed I plan on having a nicer day
When these punk ass rappers keep my name in they mouth, like they some type of gay
You know me dog, so watch what you say (You better watch your mouth!)
We ain't playing no games with your lame ass nigga, fuckboy you can die today (I swear you can!)
I keep a chopper in my backseat, actually it's my Glock partner (My Glock, partner!)
Play crazy if you want to, fuck around and get shot partner (Get shot partner!)
I don't like these niggas, and really fuck these niggas
Talk crazy in ya raps if you want, when you see me you won't touch me nigga! (Won't touch me niggas!)
Ball all around in my flip flop, you think TIP soft? Well then why don’t you try me
If you really gon' be dramatic, we gon' to need some music, they queuein' the violin
I'm talking slow singing, flower bringing
Empty a clip in you earing, and you chest thing, and you out the door
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)
The car I’m driving make you feel some type of way (They can’t afford this nigga!)
The cash I get it make you feel some type of way (Bankrolls-R-Us!)

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Shout to Chi-Town!
Dedication 5, since '05!
Know that!

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass witchyo' fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with ya breasts showin'
Like a salad no dressing, take ya to ya favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread then fuck in the restroom
They don't ask for a pass when yo ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
And I'mma buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it, I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy
Coffee, brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait it wasn't
Oh and I forgot I'll take a microwave or oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen, my homeboy like your sister
Maybe they can bake some cousins, ooh isn't that sweet
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass

[Hook: Chance the Rapper]
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see, I'm lying through my teeth
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter, better yet, sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, "I-I love you too"
It's Wayne's world, she say, "What is this world coming to?"
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, "Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
"What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of, my memory ain't what it used to be"
She said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...

[Hook: Chance the Rapper]
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?

You don't believe me? I know
D5, what up 5?
I-I love you too...I do



[Verse 1: Euro]
I'm that Dominican nigga, your bitch be talkin' 'bout
I'm in a different city, you can fuck her now
I got a whole collection of my ho collection
Y-M-C-M-B no autocorrection
I said, "Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas"
Security don't check my niggas, all y'all niggas gon' respect my niggas
Either that or get a whack or get a bat to the back of the neck my nigga
Yeah that shorty with y'all with y'all, cause she never met a big dog 'til she met my niggas
Got a big dream, from a small town
Got a small circle, you never get around
Old hoes thinkin' I'mma put 'em on now
Room full of bad bitches, I'mma put 'em all down
Always been broke, who's rich now?
I ain't never had change, why switch now?
Money talks nigga, I ain't never heard shit
Til y'all heard me spit, now everything loud
Got a mojo, with a flow-flow
Got a whole load, don't know if it's a promo
Never cuff hoes, hell no that's a no-no
Coolin' in the cut with a bud sipping romo
No love for the po-po's
Gotta pour more for my niggas in the hell hole
Never tell though, I'mma need a little more dope for my uncle
Cause I sell flows and he sell dope, nigga work

[Break: Mack Maine]
Yeah, Euro
What up this Mack the fortune teller
The nigga that put y'all on Miley Cyrus
Negrodamus my nigga
Predicting futures
You need some lottery numbers holla at me nigga I got you

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Put a nigga in that hearse, long ass K no nina
Word to Martin I'm cold with this homie buck shots
Like Pam make a nigga say, "Damn Gina"
Millzy! Money don't mean nothing, my youngin'
I'll kill you for some sneakers
This Dedication 5, no vacations slime
We in the endzone and they in bleachers
Cheerleaders, we ain't worried 'bout nothin', nothin'
Nigga act dumb, push the button, fuck 'em
Get 'em out of here like the 6th foul in the NBA
Little nigga no discussion
Boy I'll close ya case, like judge Millz Lane
All y'all wack ass niggas stay out of Millz lane
Big guns that go over the shoulder dog
My team strapped, no overalls
So please don't make me do it, got soldiers and shooters
These bullets will swallow like shots of Kahlua
When we light up the weed then we fly like a rumor
Then hop on the plane and fly over you losers
Put racks on your head now you sleep in the sewer
I'm not from this era that beef on computers
Look boy if it's war, then all we comin' after you
Special I'm smashin ya, somethin' like Gallagher
Shots in your challenger, shots in your passenger
Hittin' your girl then I'm passing her
Jae Millz ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Young Money ain't worried 'bout nothin'
D5!

[Outro: Jae Millz]
We ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Young Money)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Jae Millz)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (not a thing)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (D5)

This ain't a dick, this a motherfuckin' python
And if it's war call me, fuck Tyrone
You know what? It's time for y'all niggas to sit
Big ass house, no room for bullshit
Such and such told me, "Chuck, you ain't rich!"
Well tell such and such they can suck my dick
Cause I got a lot of sperm if you need it, sperm if you need it
I made you go crazy for no fuckin' reason
I beat you pussy niggas up 'til you start bleedin'
Menstrual cycle, fuck it, go ahead bleach 'em
Diarrhea, I'm running this shit, I'm just gettin' my laps on
All my niggas strapped up and y'all pussy niggas got strap-ons
Bitch we breed this 5-stars, bitch we bleed these 5-stars
YMCMB, you can come get fucked by 5 stars!
She ain't got too comfortable, I done made her stupid ass walk home
I kill the beat the barrel on the yopper round as a motherfuckin' Super Dome
You know I'm a fuckin' beast, yeah I'm a fuckin' creep
You could get these 30 clips if you wanna make a scene
Tune let me off the leash, now I run the fucking streets
Two fingers in her pussy, then I tell her pussy, "Peace!"
It's Chuckee, she say, "Yo' name Chuckee?"
I said, "No, my name's Suck Me!"
Introduce you to T if your stupid ass lucky
Fuke roll 'em fat, kinda got my nose stuffy
All my niggas on gas, Quik Trip
And all my niggas gon' blast this shit
See, all y'all niggas doin' bad and shit
So really I'mma act a fuckin' ass this year
Trukfit on my neck, that Truk mean I'll truck your ass
She got junk up in her trunk, I guess it's time to take out the trash
And you thought this shit was over
Got paper like a fuckin' school folder
If her grass ain't cut, get the lawnmower
Tony, tell them bitches it's Libra gang
Vocal lessons, let the nina sing
Before I leave up out this bitch, they gon' know my fuckin' name
Birdman Jr. Junior! Fuck a dog, bitch I got a puma
Man these niggas' pussies stink, no wonder why I was smellin' tuna
Lame ass boys don't want no trouble, pussy niggas just a bunch of suckers
Smashing all they moms, you could call me a motherfucker
Man I'm about to act an ass and this shit here? Just a little tease
Pull big willie out my pants and all them girls say, "Hercules!"
Bitch I'm livin' B.I.G., my gun is little cease
If that girl don't pop it off, I'll just skeet right on her weave
Okay that gold pack in my pocket; I'm like a rag up in a socket?
And when I cock that nina nine, you better not cock block me
YM be the shit, I say, "Damn everybody else"
I be kicking girls out the condo, I got a black belt
Big bro said, "It's your time nigga"
You heard what the fuck the man said
Boy I body these verses, that's why they cost a arm and a leg
Left that coochie smokin', she gon' fail her drug test
My chain on freeze, call my shit under arrest
I'm gone!

[Outro]
Mike turn the mic off dog!
Fuck, I'm just playing around dog
Man cut the beat off before Tune get back!



[Verse 1]
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
These niggas wear dresses and y'all call me weird nigga?
Go in niggas' pockets while we here
What kind of cologne do you wear because all I could smell is fear nigga
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Boy I'm from New Orleans where the dope fiends kill niggas
Brains came out his fucking ear
I got a full clip, I empty the whole thing up in here
Now I'mma keep a pill and a blunt
I might pass the motherfucker but most likely I'mma flunk
Tell my bitch I could do bad on my own
She say "You gon' miss me nigga." I say "Bitch the thrill is gone"
I ain't drove it look better in the driveway
Married to the MOB, man you niggas just some bridesmaids
Bitches give me head instead of playing mind games
Tattooed tears for my homies, it's a cryin' shame
You could get a Dom P bottle to your face
Niggas just construction workers, trynna build a case
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Why your bitch blowing me up? If I answer, I deflate
Motherfucker I'm like
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
I fuck her 'til she cry, make that ho drink her fuckin' tears
Lord, I hope she swallow more than tears
Then her homegirl came in the room and volunteered
Man, dreads hanging out the ski mask
Run up in your house, the couch potatoes getting mashed
Run up in the kitchen get your stash out the oven
You wonder how we know? stop talking while you cuddlin'
Ain't nothing like some pussy when you going through something
Just called a bad bitch, I said I'm going through something
Bugatti sitting still, look like it's going 200
Pussy nigga keep your mouth closed like you chew onions
Mother fucker I'm like
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Rather be judged by my jewelry, not a jury of my peers
And I got some kush to hide in her brassiere
And we only selling what the boat bring here nigga
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Cause I got shooters on the roof like some fucking reindeer
And I'm probably with the model of the year
I'm about to go Pac with the nose ring up in here
Uh, lifestyles of the rich and famous
Young Money motherfucking Entertainment
And y'all know Marley got the chopper up in here
Yeah, me, myself and I, the fucking Three Musketeers
Smoke like I fucking disappeared
I check your pussy ass, and wait for it to clear nigga
Tunechi, everybody know your name like Cheers, nigga
Started from the bottom now my whole team here nigga!
Tunechi!

[Outro]
Yeah, D5

Pass the scalpel to me, on my open-hearted surgeon flow
Why are all these coppers trippin?
Bitches down there, searching clothes
Yeah, I'm drinking stupid
What the fuck you think I'm swerving for?
Look, I be with that nigga from New Orleans
Who be asking if you heard me, even though he wasn't talking
Seen a straight chick do some dyke shit and didn't pause
And she was probably brokenhearted
I'm so gone, I probably caused it
I'm just saying
They ain't fucking with me
Bet they talking bout murdering me
But, look, Tune, I just don't see the killer in these niggas
2Pac's hologram was realer than these niggas

I'm a dream chaser for stacking cheddar
I'm in my Olympic Dream Team's Retros Number 7s
What you know about getting money?
Hop out the coupe, I got your bitch in there, I leave the engine running
I hit the block, talk shit, roll a few stogies
Pop a bar, kill a lil' time on my Rollie
David Copperfield, I make a hundred disappear

Nigga hating on my new deal, James Harden

With the weed, I did coke numbers, real talk
A buck fifty every three months, real talk

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]

Smoke weed with the windows up
High as fuck, but inching up
Pussy niggas tensing up

Money talks, your minutes up
You can judge us, but don't sentence us
Blow me like the wind would gust
We trukfit and we supered up
W-T-F, who to fuck?

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And this, bitch I'm rolling with is cute
And her ass on fire
And the whole time, I ain't feel a tooth
Then I ate that pussy 'til I lost a diamond and I'm gone...



[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She say my dickhead need a crown on it
She say my cum tastes like holy water
She say she get hiccups just thinkin' of me
I said, "Next time, bring your drinkin' buddy"
I told her, this that Dedication 5
And anything else is a consolation prize
I said, "I'm cumming," she say, "Take your time"

[Hook]
Yeah, I told her take her drawers off and she says I ain't wearin' none
I asked her, "Who this pussy for?" She said "Ransom"
And when she says "I Love You", I say, "Shut up, take this dick"
She treat me like a God and tell her man she atheist
And then he calls with all that bitchin'
"Who is this?" She busy, call her later

[Verse 2]
Now we switchin' positions, we in here getting creative
I put Champagne on her titties, then sip it out her navel, boy
I live in pussy, let me speak to my neighbors, I say
Clean the puke off of the toilet bowl
Treat the pussy like revolving doors
Ran outta rubbers at the corner store
She in my ear, like "What you want them for?"
Well, give me brains since you a smart-aleck
Fuck her all night and don't smell it
Open her mind like a watermelon, haha, you jealous

[Hook]
I told her take her drawers off and she says I ain't wearin' none
I asked her who this pussy for, she said ransom
And when she says "I Love You", I say,  "Shut up, take this dick"
She treat me like a God and tell her man she atheist
He on that phone with all that bitchin'
"Who is this?" She busy, call her later
Now we kissin', we twisted, my dick in a tornado
She say, "Hit it," I hit it, I hit it raw like yayo, I admit it

[Bridge]
(That fuckin' corner store man)
Uh, we makin' love like money
Yeah, yeah, like money
Like money
Told her this that Dedication 5
Dedication 5
I killed that pussy, it came back to life

[Hook]
I told her take her drawers off and she said "Why you playin' dumb?"
I asked her "Who this pussy for?" She didn't answer
And she say "Ooh, I love you," I said "Shut up, take this dick"
Would tell her say my name, but I gave her an alias

[Verse 3]
And oh my god she swallowed triplets, she gripped with
The hand that rocks the cradle, I'm so lifted, what is this? This here a Dedication
It was scripted, predicted, and shout out to my skaters
Boy, I live in pussy, let me speak to my neighbors, I say

[Outro]
D5
What up 5?
I told her this that Dedication 5
We makin' love like money




[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got shotguns under my staircase
Rob yo ho ass bare face
Been had this bitch on lock, I’m bout to get this bitch a cellmate
All my life I been this cold
All my nights I spend with hoes
I keep change on me now
‘Cus this shit’s startin to take a toll
I just flew 2 hoes in, oh how time flies, clip its wings
Make you spit that safe combination, out like Listerine
And even though I’m not an artist this is where I draw the line
We don’t feel none of you niggas
Y'all some fuckin porcupines
I still got residue all on my dinner plates
Real niggas in my inner circle
None of my checks come late, I ain’t having that, I give em curfews
Dressed up like a old lady, uzi under my church dress
Surprise yo ass like a baby… taking his first steps
I’m too good for just any bad bitch
Smoke like I’ve been kissing dragons
That milk carton show her missing panties
That pussy felt like a hidden valley
Thank God that I’m so gifted
I wouldn’t return a single gift
But all good things must come to an end
Like this blunt burning my fingertips
Lil' Tune

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
This ain’t what you want
Put that gun to yo ho head
Make her tell me what you don’t
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that’s a pocket full of stones
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong aw!
Neil Armstrong aw! Neil Armstrong
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong!
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that’s a pocket full of stones
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong aw!

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Striper pole on the yacht
Striper pole in my spot
I got yo girl in my condo
Bitch I’m ballin like Rondo
Flexin ranches up in Texas
I know it’s a blessing but I don’t know what’s a recession
If we talkin mew mew’s, Jimmy Choos and Giuseppe she got it
I star 6-7, my flights I fly private
I’m a walkin hedge fund
I copped a 62 for leg room
This bitch text saying her lights off
I bought her a new crib, it’s a tax write-off

[Hook: Future]
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
Foreva
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
Hold it
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
Step up in this kitchen
Just step back take a look at me
Listen , that Ferrari unreleased
Stop being so defensive, I’m making real decisions
That’s the reason why we winning
We flying, we finished

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Rich Gang, we drop feathers to vall
Rich Gang ball 'till you fall
We hit the block dippin cuz the block hot
Record sales, ship it from the Hard Knox
Live it like we live it twice
Ballin with them bright lights

Bad bitches want em all
Hella choppas on the surface
Mansion on the beach, nigga that’s the purpose
Blow it cuz the swag is perfect
First class flights, nigga we done murked em

[Hook: Future]

Come on, come on, come on, come
Shout for the 17, shout for the Hollygrove
Shout for the 17

You dig
You understand me

[Verse 1]
Woke one morning
Tears in my eyes
And you had left me without a kiss or a note
Or goodbye
Now I got to learn to live alone
But my heart can't take it
I guess that's why I wait by the phone
For a call, a call from you
Sayin' she needs me back
Just as much as I need you
But I guess for the time, you need to stay away
Let me tell you baby, now I'm thinkin' of you every day

[Hook]
I'm thinkin' about you
I'm thinkin' about you

[Break]
Oops upside your head
I said oops upside your head
I said feet, don't fail me now
White man came down to my city
On the corner
And asked me what do I do
I said, do what I wanna
Said, do what I wanna

[Verse 2]
I keep thinkin' 'bout the good times we had
And how we let jealousy
Turn all we had good into bad
Now I realize
If you just try it again
Love will play out
You'll be my girl
I'll be your only man
   



[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I can't trust these niggas, throw some water on 'em,
They tell me "Go to Hell," Okay I know the owner
Strip clubs gettin old all the strippers hoein'
All these bitches think they dimes, watch me flip a coin
Thank You Jesus, My dogs is off the leashes
Had to leave my spanish bitch 'cuz she was startin' to get suspicious
Tell The Beef I mean business, suit and tie nigga
You and all your dogs can get euthanize nigga
Trigger happy nigga, I just can’t stop smiling
Thank God I’m fly, I had to thank my pilot
You think you’re calling shots, you got the wrong numberI love Benjamin Franklin more than his own mother
Throw that pussy, throw that pussy
And I don’t want no throw back pussy, man fuck these pussy-

Tunechi

These niggas sending threats, I'mma start sending hits
Bring me his head, so I can make sure its him
It's lonely at the top, it's lonely at the top
I think I'm 'bout to jump, niggas phony as a prop
Ain't nothing on me but this chop, turn you, your homies into slop
Put your brains all over the window, people passing window shop
Like ugh, this that pure Columbia
It's just us, fuck the rest we got insomnia
Most likely I done fucked that bitch that's laying under ya
She said she trying to see me, bitch that's Stevie Wonderful

Oh yeah I do, yeah I do
Who the fuck is Stevie J?

[Hook 1: Lil Wayne]
Don't be lookin' for no donations
You get dick, then reservations
I get pussy then hibernation
I start humpin' soon as I wake up
I woke up in some new punani
He woke up bleedin' like "who shot me?"
I kept shootin'; Boo said "you got 'em"
Now, all we gotta do is get rid of the body
But anyway I woke up in some new punani

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I was drunk as a bitch, drunk as a bitch
But not drunk as that bitch
I got in that shit acted donkey in it
Junk in her trunk, hope my trunk key can fit
Then she jumped on my dick like a monkey and shit
Monkey see monkey do, banana clips
Shoot at them niggas, no camera glitch
Wax that ass, no candle stick
And I run with some killers I eat with the mob
Got some shit built up I keep it inside
Red in my eyes, Mount Everest high
Look dead in my eyes, see death in my eyes
The TEC on my thigh and my aim so good
I could shoot a fly or a bull in the eye
Hold up, all bullshit aside
A nigga almost died but I'm outchea
Fuck around with a real nigga get murked
I been paid my dues will I get reimbursed?
Love it when she make faces
Pussy feel like vacation
Eat it like I'm dyin' of starvation
I'm at the finish line, her heart racin'
Give her to Fuke if she Caucasian
My niggas wild as Jumanji
You can call me an S.O.B
Cause its skateboards over bugattis
I used to be at them Heat games
With better seats than Pat Riley
Don't stop, pop that don't stop
Pop that Ollie, Tunechi

[Verse 2: Boo]
Sippin' on dumb, puffin' a J
Met her tonight, fuck her today
You tuck her away, I'm fuckin' her face
Wine head, she's guzzling grapes
Back shots, I'm holding her waist
Freaky, I always freak...
You know Tune my bro, but he ain't tryna meet ya
Just bring your friend, both of us'll eat her
Hater niggas be hungry
Got a hundred shots to feed 'em
Her panties are down, her legs is up
We finally fucked, she starved for months
Don't give a fuck, still I'll hit
Never no feelings, no love for these hoes
No flowers, we're simple, we fucked in the Rolls
No flowers, we're simple, we fucked in the Rolls
Royce - trick!
Now they mad, I told they was
Bitches'll be lying, I did the same
Far from a square, don't mistake me for lame
She's suckin' me off, I'm pokin' her brain
She tell me keep goin', I'm doin' my thing
That pussy so wet, I'm calling it rain
I'm giving her hundreds, she's keeping my change
I keep it a hundred, you do the same
Most women front, but who do you blame?
I gave you dick, you gave me pussy
It's safe to say it's an even exchange...
Bitch!

[Hook 2: Lil Wayne]
Don't be givin' out information
You know niggas still on probation
I get higher than expectations
You know this is the Dedication
I'm on that kush she on that molly

Shout out my nigga Luca Brasi

So I must dash, no disguises
Tunechi, I had to Dedication 5 it



[Verse]
Nigga I be hard on a ho
Cause a bitch ain't shit
And every ho I done fucked
Done sucked my dick
I had to pour out some drank
For niggas I miss
I hope my weed ain't too loud
To hear the snakes hiss
It's Dedication 5
Medication high
I gotta clean up after these niggas
Cause they be wasting time
And boy, my hoes don't get in line
Because they stay in line
I'm shining on these hoes so hard
They getting tan lines
It's Tunechi
I go hard
I put in work
Twin Glocks
The gift and the curse
Dirty money
No footprints in dirt
We geeked up
The revenge of the nerds
I swear, play with these niggas
That's that shit I don't do
As long as money talks
I got someone to talk to
Watch my dogs
Treat the beef like dog food
I got the power
But a short fuse
Let's go
I can't trust my iPhone
I think Siri the Feds
You know snitches get stitches
Nigga, needle and thread
You better walk it like you talk it
Or we cut off your legs
Pretty please don't kill my vibe
I ain't too proud to beg
Alright, fucking right
Shoot you up at the light
Straight take all your possessions
Call that shit poltergeist
And my homie, he a sniper
We call him Wesley Snipes
I call my bitch Plane Jane
Cause she catch nut like a flight
I'm on a mission to get movie money
Stick to the script
Your bitch leaking information
I just follow the drip
Soon as I get that coupe
I'mma go get the rims
Toss the keys to my homie
Tell that nigga it's his
I feel like He-Man when I'm in your ho
And tell that bitch give me my space
Like a telescope
In her throat
Like Ricola
My system solar
I'm too young to die sober
Your man a cobra
Watch that nigga
Let's go
Boy, my bitches got bitches badder than your bitches
But I can't trust none of them bitches though
Like magicians
Straight blowing money fast
I'mma get a ticket
Soon as I get off paper
I'mma smack a nigga
No broken mirrors
I can't see myself broke
Right back pocket
Flag redder than a velvet rope
Never say never
She might do her friend
You never know
Shorty make that dick stand up
Like it's telling jokes
I swear to God
I put in work
I'm on them shrooms
My goons on alert
I spit these bars
This a uni-verse
You better duck
Like Dooney and Bourke
I'm telling ya
Shout out Turk
It's Hot Boys
Bitch, the block is hot
If I ain't have the keys to success
I would have picked the lock
Diarrhea, shit don't stop
Until my fucking casket drop
Still got that crack
Maybe one day I'mma pass the rock
Tunechi
Dedication 5
What up Five



[Question:
Are you still competitive in the rap game?]

[Answer:]
Uhhm, competition is different these days
That competition is competing for my awesome fan base
My awesome fans
Attention, you know what I mean
For them to still say that they love me
And competing for they love and competing for them to still fucking with me
Things like that
That’s my competition these days and I love it



[Lead-In: DJ Drama]
I mean it’s simple
Can’t fuck wit us

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I got money on yo head, I don’t do my dirty work
I cut off my hands, I don’t even touch the work
I pray these niggas don’t fuck with me and I don’t like to curse in church
And my girl’ pussy taste just like Mrs. Butterworth’s
I mean that, believe that

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Don’t be short with that work nigga
We find out where yo ho work nigga
We follow your moms from church nigga
You gonna have to swallow yo pride like a thirst quencher
Get 'em Tune, I don’t really fuck around with certain niggas
Fuck all yall niggas, except my niggas
These niggas hustling backwards
Check your rear-view mirror and your side mirrors
OG Kush keep my mind clearer
That choppa get yo mind right
I got two choppers, that’s chopsticks
Eat yo block up like shrimp fried rice
Been so long since I seen my eyes white
You know I smoke like dry ice
Better stay in your lane or get sideswiped
It’s going down, let me straighten up and fly right
Still can’t turn a ho into a housewife
Man, it’s like some things will never change
You ain’t got a shot in a gun range
These chumps ain’t even got chump change
Uh, yeah, and don’t fuck with me, you know I’m Gotti
Check yourself before I sign it
Yeah, I’m shinin on these niggas, no horizon
Yeah, and it’s going down if I’m her pilot
Uh, my new car is so robotic
My new bitch is so provided, money talks, yours like no comment
Black car, racial profiling, rest in peace to Christopher Wallace
Desert Eagle like the Mojave, I get my work from Rico Suave
Uh, it’s a Rollie if I got time on my hand
If you ever see me broke, write on my cast
Boy, my weed so good, I cry when it’s gone
Had a phone in jail, that’s a cellphone
Yeah, I’m bout to buy a machine gun
We drink it all, leave clean cups, make mountains look like speed bumps
I’m sittin on some train tracks, hopin' that bitch speed up
I’m strong-arming these niggas, roll my sleeves up, yeah
I got bad bitches on standby, all my hoes got cat eyes
Celebrate when a rat die, make a nigga fall back like he getting baptized
Put me in a hospital room, full of flat lines, I’m Tunechi Lee immortal
My name ringing, my name ringing, hello may I take your order?
I say, Testarossa over testimony
Got so much shit built up you could smell it on me
Fuck all y'all niggas in Swahili nigga
Ain’t nothing free round here but Willy, nigga
AK-47, call it Mr. Biggs
All my niggas bloods, fuck your syringe
Chop his head off, put it in the fridge
Try not to mistake that shit for dinner, Dedication

[Verse 2 : T.I.]
Hey let me introduce you niggas to America's Most
Every nigga round with me carry a tote
Sadity bitches, like a nigga Tune on the low
They just be like 10 and be doing the most
Okay, Tune in the jet flyin over the boat
I’m on the way from the Panama, I got a few on the boat
What you niggas make a year, I could do with the blow
You keep on playin with me, bet I’ll put a few in you, ho
The fate of a fuck nigga, we soon to see
These niggas sweet as perfume to me
I mean, really, like cartoon to me
Ain’t nobody fuckin with Tune and me
Hustle Gang, bang green, in God we trust
Young Money, Cash Money, they down with us
I got a bitch who want you bitch, you finna give the ho up
And don’t buck, shawty listen, you don’t really know us
We a bust a nigga head, leave him layin' for dead
I get caught with a banger, I’ma lay in the feds
In gen. pop., nigga, every day in the feds
I was chillin on the yard, really going hard
And these pussy niggas catchin' feelings over broads
King, pussy nigga, but I'm really like a god
A-Town nigga, Bankhead, I’m about it
Everybody know to fuck with me cuz I got it



[Verse One]
Uh, I'm flying private through Cloud 9
Yeah, if you got a problem, I'm Einstein
Yeah, I'm yawnin', I'm so tired of ballin'
Yeah, only selling work to them workaholics
Got guns bigger than you nigga, I don't fuck with new niggas
I blues your bitch ass, hope somebody give you rhythm
I got animal all in my floor, take your shoes off at the door
Niggas feed these bitches lies, nigga don't food poison my ho
I buy my drugs for the low, like a coupon on at the store
My niggas like Kanye with that good, my niggas like Lou Rawls with that blow
Niggas be sayin' they racked up, don't let that Q-ball leave you broke
I know you want a pat on the back, but then those fools goin' see you choke
I saw your bitch and she said, she tryin' to move on and let go
Boy, I get up in that pussy and hit her with moves you don't even know
Niggas be trippin' over these hoes, I done came too far to get close
I've been outchea gettin' bread and I don't need you all in my loaf
If you stick your neck out there, I'll have my goon's all at your throat
Niggas be lukewarm at the most and when I'm through ballin' I coach
Shout out to my nigga Mack gettin' his boo on in that Ghost
I'm still coming off the top of the dome but it'd be on a tombstone if I wrote, Tunechi

[Hook]
My kids already rich and they don't even know
These nigga's sayin' they playa's, they ain't even scored
My bitch rolling my weed, she don't even smoke
Everybody following me, I ain't even Moses, nigga

[Verse Two]
Uh, my cologne illegal in nine countries
I found a way like it was hiding from me
Yeah, my weed good, my sex better
Bitch, don't text me no long letters
I'm ahead of the game, I need a blowjob
Most of these ho's ain't got no job
And these niggas goin' buy em' everything
You goin' fuck around, and get the ho robbed
I'm ahead of the game, I need a haircut
Used to hug the block, I mean bear hug
And tell them rats the AK go Rat-a-Tat, like snare drums
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard, dick harder than a armadillo
MLK would be proud of me, cause I do this shit for all my niggas
Her mouth, pussy, or asshole, life is full of hard decisions
If she ain't fuckin', she get the boot, let me write this bitch a parking ticket
Ain't got time for love life, all I know is get paid
I'm high like Bonjour, twisted like french braids
I got my own shoes, SLIME, T, I feel like MJ
I'm working that graveyard shift, man these niggas been dead

[Hook]
Uh, I feel asleep in that pussy and I didn't even know
I woke up and acted like I didn't even know her, yeah
Don't fuck with these fuck niggas, you already know us
I'm looking for that loud pack, weedman bring the noise
Yeah

[Verse Three]
Pass that weed to the next nigga, blunt longer than a tongue twista
Hoes want this scud missile, I'mma ball, like Crystal
Lil Tunchi Li, young sex pistol, new money, no wrinkles
I'm hard headed, Ocho, Dedication Cinco, uh

[Outro]
What up 5?
Rocko fuck with me! Yeah!
Future fuck with me! Yeah!
T, I feel like MJ
I'm working that graveyard shift, man these niggas been dead
5!



[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Man all you pussy niggas drive me crazy
Make me sick to my stomach, I feel nauseated
All you haters hold hands and jump off a building
I could still taste her pussy, memorabilia
Backpack full of artillery
One me, no equivalent
These niggas acting like lil bitches
I don’t understand this shit, Like you scribbled it
Took her clothes, step back and exhibit it
Then tear her ass up like a parking ticket
The end of the road is at walking distance
Have to get that blood off my hands, left the faucet drippin
In yo face like a airbag in a car collision
My weed man so consistent
I’m stayin rich, tryin not to make poor decisions
Everything I do I plan it out like a solar system
Nigga if you clumsy you gon slip and fall a victim to me
Your bitch is sendin' naked pictures to me
Then she shoot over to my house, I scoot over in a bed
I shoot off in her mouth then she bit the bullet uh
Skatin on em like I’m Lil Wayne
And the weed so strong I can feel veins
Write it down, take a picture, now I feel framed
The drugs got me so numb I can’t feel ashamed
And my girl at home with the mood swings
Girl I gotta make a few runs like Usain
Wish I had a penny for my thoughts for some loose change
Hungry niggas going at yo neck for that food chain
Drop some pills that make me sleepy
Hoes creep me in they Teepee
I hope that pussy taste like kiwi
Hope it’s nicer than Tahiti, hopin I could get a freebie
Leavin a nigga body floatin with a mouth full of seaweed
What's in my Louis backpack, that’s E.T
Snitches give me the heebeegeebees
I hope they’ll disappear, where the fuck is Houdini?
I got niggas on my side, you got niggas on yo back
I’mma yell timber, money grow on trees
Money over queens, fuck you blow me
I sit back enjoy the breeze, hoes prettier than please
I don’t really do shit but sit back and call the shots
She poured out her heart, I had it on the rocks
Red beam on yo head, that’s a cherry on top
You don’t wanna keep your cool, I know niggas that’ll die uh
I danced with the devil in my dreams
When I wake up I still hear the same song
Make me wanna blow a motherfucker brains out
Flood warning nigga, I’m about to brainstorm, lil nigga
I’ll take yo main ho, make her call her homegirl
Make em share the same dick
It’s that motherfuckin Dedication 5
I just hope I’ll be alive to see a Dedication 6
Lil Tunechi

[Verse 2: Vado]
Ayo it’s levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Been doing MIA since Levels was the shit
And niggas know I’m on another level with this shit
I’m pedaling the 6, full metal when it hit
All I need is a shovel and a ditch
You done dig me a hole then you show me where it is
Run in his home and show me where the kids
Put one in his dome while he going in his fridge
That’s me, him nigga
Black piece AP, gold trim nigga
Black jeans, grey tee, old Tim’s nigga
Backstreet, everything go for 10 nigga
Keep quiet, beef we deep fry it
I’m in the streets like Rodney King’s riots
Mommy opposed their lead tight
On that old bullshit, Pete Myers
They scream and seize fire
My audible like Godfather meets Wire
A felon in the whip
Rollin 3 6’s, devil on trips
Shots whistled like a kettle when it’s lit
I’m tryin to go ballistic, shadow in the ship
Call the Barney Rubble in the whip
Made her kick rocks, blow haze from ziplocks uh



[Lil Wayne Talking]
Whats poppin'? Whaddup 5?
The problem with me is i believe in you too much
Whoo! Ya heard me? We in this bitch
Uh.. I dont really consider myself a living legend
Because uh... Sometimes legends arent true
So... And sometimes i dont even feel like im living
So... To answer the question about what it is to be a living legend
Uh! Honestly i wouldn't know
But what it is to be Lil Wayne; its amazin' its awesome
I wouldn't give it up for the world
Ya dig?



[Hook: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

[Verse 1: Euro]
I've been having these nightmares of losing time, with no reward
Momma would call the Lord, before she call the law
Then I went and found time in a Audemars
Time is money, so I spent it all trying to order more
They say beef is a poor man's sport
Behind the money, get that rhyme report, fuck it

[Hook: Method Man]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I don't cut the work, droptop on 20's
Soon as I learned how to talk I talked business
Nigga's ain't safe, all 9 innings
And to you it's just change, I want every JC Penney
And I walk up in your funeral late, suit rented
Lift a mini skirt, get behind her like Benny
Goin' at your neck, get the rope, tie a noose
This a gut check, now who do I write it to?
I'm dirty like ENT, shout out to Murphy Lee
Gotta cut up the credit cards, plastic surgery
I'm a God, mercy me, I'm higher than Mercury
Smokin' on that strong, full of that Hercules
Bartender, hurry up, hurry up with my drink
Nigga's pullin capers like a they come with a string
I'm standing over the stove with my gun in the sink
Cause I don't know what niggas thinking, but I know how they think
Uh, catch a skateboard to the jaw, I'm in that pussy, she in awe
In this here is my homeboy, Quick Draw McGraw
I'm even on both sides of the seesaw
You can get your head cut off with a saw, yeehaw
Kill you and your right-hand man, Southpaw
Money over bitches, and above the law
Money over bitches, and above the law, money

[Hook: Method Man]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pocket full of money, with a posse full of hitters
Black and white Porsches, like a Nazi with a nigga
Money make the world, 360
We throw them dollars up, them bitches better be Frisbees
Pounds in the freezer, 50 rounds in the sweeper
Counter full of coke, naked bitch baggin' up
And if the bitch stealing, I know where her Mama live
I love this shit so much, I got on a tux
Man, it's been a minute since I seen my nigga Bubba
Some niggas fade away, some niggas hit the jumper
Kidnap your niece, don't cry, call your uncle
We don't wanna hurt ya, baby, we just want your uncle
25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
I ain't hearin' that bullshit, I'm deafer than Leppard
Somewhere out wherever, they find your body severed
You know they findin' nigga's guilty like they find the treasure
But get your money on occasions, I get too wasted, it's an occasion
I heard a nurse say, "Thank you for being so patient"
I know my nigga's got me, we good forever
Get the cheese nigga, please, avoid the shredder
Turning good to better, gotta pull it together
I wish that blood on the floor, was rose pedals
Real gangstas die of old age
And old money, get paid my nigga, Tunechi

[Hook: Method Man]



[Hook: Gudda Gudda]
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I’m a east side nigga

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
I got the 2-2-3 cocked, I point it at yo melon
Loose lips sink ships so ain’t no motherfucking telling
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
Gas up the minivan, put the pumps in the trunk
Now I be sippin on something, they got me tilt to the side
All black ski mask, red chinese eyes
Now I’ve been hungry for years, I’mma take yo plate
I’ma eat yo steak dead in yo face
I woke up on a mission, I got 2 women I ride with
One named Nina and that yapper my side bitch
We size niggas up so wisely choose who you side with
Got something on my side that pack a kick – that’s my sidekick
I’m about that paper, roll the dice and get paid
And they can’t bite the hand I’m feeding with, I’m holding grenades
So I’mma talk my shit, I’mma live my life
I’mma nail yo girl, shit I did that twice
Gudda!

[Hook: Gudda Gudda]
I’m a east side nigga
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Money don’t make itself
These niggas gon make me kill em
I should probably see a shrink but I’m afraid he’ll make me little
I’ve been a beast since I could remember
I got too many hoes, that’s my dilemma
Chop yo fuckin head off and put it on the front of my car like the emblem
Get em, I got Mike Banger on the beat, I got this banger on display
I just test-drove a new Lamborghini and got a A
Got a billion bitches, I’m lookin for the one that got away
And since all these niggas watching, ask them for the time of day
Fuck yall niggas I’m skating
Got yo ho at the skate park waiting
That dick keep her coming back, motherfucking reincarnation
I don’t want that pussy if it's spatious
Just give me fellatio
My bitch named Gigi give me head, I be like goodness gracious, fuck
Hi, my name is Tune, it’s nice to eat ya
I still keep that gun like a secret
Another one bites the dust, would you like to eat it?
Boy I have the people looking for you like a reason uh
You don't want to hit my blunt cause I been eating pussy all day
This gun got a hair trigger, I pull this bitch til it’s bald head
Ye ain’t got no bars nigga
Recharge, you going dead
Can’t kill me, I was born dead
Crowned of thorns head
Devil horns red, have my barn head
I’m a serial killer, yo lucky charm dead
And that trash bag, they find you arm leg leg leg arm head
Oh what a tangled web we weave I feel like daddy long legs
Hop out that Ferrari Spider for my boys at Rikers and all my lifers
My bitch say my dick is great
But I make her say it like Tony the Tiger
I own a rifle and I’m on the edge
I bop bop and I’m ridin off
I’m devastation, I’m Freddy Jason, Dedication 5, 5 stars
Tunechi



[Hook - Lil Wayne]
I love all my bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
A 2 dollar bill is still a couple dollars
And if any one of them niggas got a fuckin' problem
I'mma milk all of 'em cause they fuckin' cowards
I love red bitches, there's just something 'bout 'em
But I'm gettin' better pussy from a brown one
Been schoolin' y'all niggas, I'm your alma mater
I'm the shit, where the fly swatter

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
I know you dykin' who you eatin' on
Make me think about all them nights we got a threesome on
Make me think about how you suck it like your teeth are gone
If your friends hatin' on you, fuck 'em to each his own, yessir
I do my drugs then I sleep 'em off
Like it just be callin' me, I need to turn my ringer off
Ain't a fuckin' singalong unless you brought the weed along
That kush, okay I got it, that kush
Cop pounds and put my people on
We can take the stairs up to the stars that's where we belong
Fuck that shit you talk, I beat that pussy like production
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian, or like Jordan, beat the buzzer
Nigga, gimme what you've got, take that money like an usher
One man band, all you hear is repercussion
Told a bitch, too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction
She looked me in my eyes and said
Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin', I said shorty, you a beast

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
I love bad bitches, okay, what's the problem
If she thinks she gonna come up then I'mma fuckin' drown her
I'm wilder than public schools and public housing
Can't afford failure, I'm just browsing
I was 15 with $100,000
And if you talk trash I'mma fuckin' possum
And nigga, if your bitch got eye problem
You know what it is, armed robbery
Tunechi

[Verse 2 - Euro]
I heard 'em tell me "Go get 'em, young"
I haven't seen a movie since I started livin' one
I be in a room full of bitches gettin' drunk
Smokin' like a point guard, no look, passin' blunts
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Euro, this and that
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And niggas schemin' on what I had, but
We gon' put money in the bag or a body in the bag (You choose)
And all these new bitches old news
Throwin' stacks at 'em like "That's prolly gon' bruise"
And every dream girl that I fucked came true
Now every night feels like deja vu
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you
I tell a baby, "Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes"
And I murder that pussy, and I ain't leave a clue
Cause I put her on her knees and made her swallow all the proof
That sick shit, I'm ill, yeah, I'm a fuckin' problem
I'm fine wit' it, though, bitches like fuckin' problems
And I can't solve shit if I'm the fuckin' problem
Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a fuckin' problem
Out the city, but you can't take the city out 'em
I know these hoes well, see the water spittin' out 'em?
Long story short, money always colorblind
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms
(Euro)

[Verse 3 - Kidd Kidd]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
Had a few ugly bitches but I had to hide em
Can't live with em, Can't live without em
Can't trust them hoes poking holes up in condoms
Put a S on her breast, she a supermodel
If you swallow these kids, does that make you childish
Now she say I got a fuckin problem
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her
Her hair blown out like the 80s
I drive these bitches crazy, mental asylum should pay me
I ain't looking for a lady, call Will Smith to get you hitched
I ain't looking for a wife, I need a one night trick
That can ride it like that, suck it like this
Hit it from the back in the back of the whip
I'm a mac, I'm a pimp girl
You don't need make up, put this mac on your lips
She drive a X5, beefin' with her ex man
Baby Ima dog and a DMX fan
Told myself I wouldn't mess with my ex again
Popped a lil x then i tried explain
I keep it too real to ever be a lame
Too many girls in this world, you all be lame
She all on my dick cause I got street fame
Told that thirsty ass bitch don't speak my name
Kidd Kidd, a nut from the 9
Tell em don't worry bout me I'm just fine
Girl if you comin' with me then let's ride
I know you want money so don't waste my time
Uh, wear that ass out fuck her till we pass out
Fuck a hotel, we goin' to my mans house
Scratch that your baby mama was an Amtrak
We treat that pussy like some good weed and pass that
Yeah, to my niggas, she fuck my niggas
Bought some bitches, and she was wit' it
With you she wasn't, but she did it
She let you lick it, but never stick it
You be trippin, you say you fallin
Nigga you slippin, stupid ass nigga tryna' fall in love
If i fall it's gon be from too many drugs
You asking questions, bout what she was
With the rider game, she told you in the club



[Intro: Pharrell & 2 Chainz]
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Aye, like that?

Dreads hang on designer everything
Mr. Comme des Garçons, Mr. Alexander Wang
Mr. Chain, pinky ring, flow insane, ho insane
Man, these shoes I got on, these the hardest I done seen
It look clean when you pour it, I remix it make it dirty
If she got good head and text me, I text back and tell her "hurry"
This that category 5 when I walk up in the strip club
Throw it high, make you and George Washington head butt
OG's never fed us, now young niggas fed up
Ballin' so hard I deserve a and one
Baking soda marketing, I'm getting it ain't I? Obviously
You a bitch, you a ho, that's just my philosophy
And I'm known to kick it like the captain of a soccer team
Billie Jean red leather same color Red Lobster
And she brain wash ya, head doctor

[Hook: 2 Chainz & Pharrell] x2
I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching

Drop topping, head bopping

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Bullet ain't got no name, her pussy ain't got no smell
Got this bitch on lock, these niggas ain't got no bail
These snitches ain't got no pride, these hoes ain't got no manners
These tricks ain't got no magic, ain't that a bitch?.
But me, I make shit taste like sugar cane
Bout to go to bed with what's her name?
Yeah, pussy never felt so good
And you know we don't smoke that bullshit
Give that shit back to that bull, uh
I'm so sick of balling, I'm so sick of balling
Ride me like a horse, Bitches call me Charlie.
Swear to god, I never met a nigga with enough money
I'm riding around in that new thing with no roof like a hush puppy.
Shhh, I look down at the stars
I could pull a few strings, make it sound like guitars
Told that bitch she my boo, now the round of applause
Shit, I'mma be dressed to kill, now the dead watching
Tunechi!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I]
I Strivers Row my Denim, bankrolls all in 'em
I’m maximum, you minimal
Make dough, you better get you some
Them corners, we be bent in 'em
Better ask bout us, we been a fool
Shot of weed with the one with the pounds of the weed
And the quarter keys of middle school
Beeper, sneakers, tennis shoe, that’s all we was hustling for
When I pull this strap, you don't do what I say
Nigga that's what I would bust it for
I don’t take your shit, ain’t nothing bruh
What’s all the discussion for?
I'm the motherfucking king and I'm doing my thing
Ain't my fault you can’t fuck with us
You know a counterfeit case make years in prison
Got back out, got back to getting busy
Keep playing round with it, on the real you can get it
Let a goon get a quarter mill, that'll kill it
Couple racks on that Versace suit
Just in case they watching fool
Sophisticated, my surveillance pics just like a photoshoot
Givenchy, Balenciaga, YSL and Prada
Tom Ford, LonBon, you name it, I got it
So I be fresh as fuck, going hard when the feds watching
Literally cause I’m menaging when the feds watching, ha!

[Hook]

I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
But still dumpin' whenever the drama's on
Y'all hustlers can't eat fit meals
And it feels somethin' like when it's Ramadan
Hope you chumps been walkin' with armor on
I'm who they dumping 2 Cole Hamels on
Somethin's turnin' this momma on
I love to see rumps in Ferragamo thongs
Bet it look plump when you got pajamas on
Jump in, let's hit the Bahamas ma
And it's crunk whenever I'm on the song
Bumpin' like "Bumb-ba-Bump"
I'm particularly picky
When it come to licky licky
Have 'em slidin' off them Vickies quickly
Under the doo-rag thick three sixty
It's the hypno and sticky icky
I said Okay!

[Hook]
Fly enough, to do better
But pimp enough to not give a fuck
Thug enough, to do better
And gangsta enough to not give a fuck
I'm hustlin' enough, to know better
But ballin' enough to not give a fuck
Old enough, to know better
But young enough to not give a fuck

D-d-d-d-dammit man
I'm in a throwback so old
It'll make your grandma glance
And everybody know, everybody go
So please, call the stretch ambulance
These dudes don't stand a chance
When I pull up like the pamper brand
Doors in the Lambo slants
With a madame from France
With a ass so big
You couldn't hide it in Hammer pants
Who else be in New York
With Miami tans
Got everybody doin' the Street Family dance
I'm sure this hammer can
Make you save that gangsta role for the camera man
It's F-A-B, you preferably
Don't wanna F wit me (Please believe it)
I'm definitely as responsible
For getting the City High as Clef would be (Believe it please)

[Hook]

I'm introduced to your women friends (Hello)
Cause I buy double deuces to rim a Benz
Like they boots made by Timberland
I have to remind, since I got drafted and signed
Ya'll playa's get used to the scrimagin'
Now one of the Jesuses got lemon gems? (Damn)
Know y'all lips get loose like y'all feminine
I prove letting loose with the semi can boost my adrenaline
You never had no use with that limb again
Half my roots is Dominican
Faboloso mi gusto les Benjamins
This dude got the juice of a pimp in him
Turn to stones like Medusa had glimpsed at him
But right now you can lie and gossip too
And later be the guy who the mas run to
And right now you can try to prosecute
But later on you gonna die in the hospital

[Hook]



Unh. It's the duh-duh-duh-duh-duhduhduhduhduhduh-damn

[Intro]
Damn, it the way he grab on himself
Before he getting closer to you, girls be like damn
Damn, it's the wife beater
Wish you were the one in the drop top two seater
Damn, I can't blame him
If he wasn't mine shit, I would try to claim him
Cause he's so fly, I'm so fly
You play yourself if you try to deny it, damn

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I'm nothin' like the other brother
I got no choice but to slut her
Cause I'm in a tan six with a base gut
That look something like a nutta-butta duhduhduhduh
Mami you'll be in St. Tropez
Riding jet skis and mopeds, nodding like dopeheads
Paparazzi snapping pictures, they must think you J. Lopez (bitch)
Let's roast in spinach, hit a club and just post up in it
What you mean are we here yet?
I got a lear jet that gets to the west coast in minutes (hehe)
I'm smoother than white vanilla fudge and white and yellow studs
Cause if they witness how I'm killing them out here
These girls just might go tell the judge I rest my case

[Hook]
Damn, it the way he grab on himself
Before he getting closer to you, girls be like damn (you feelin that right)
Damn, it's the wife beater
Wish you were the one in the drop top two seater (come on let's ride)
Damn, I can't blame him
If he wasn't mine shit, I would try to claim him (I'm sure you would)
Cause he's so fly, I'm so fly
You play yourself if you try to deny it, damn (and what you say girl)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
You could be prancing through ghettos
In Dior pants and stilettos
All you got to do is swallow some kids
Like that witch did Hansel and Gretel
Who's as handsome as ghetto?
This mans earring looks transparent
And my Mitchell & Ness throwbacks be so old
They could be somebody grandparents, baby like (Damn)
I want the kind of money athletes consume
I have to assume, I'm no fool but I'm so cool
When I walk in, it feel like it's a draft in the room, Whoo (Damn)
I'm so sick, I drive in reverse pass
Call me a nurse fast
Shorty just lay back in the Maybach
Get a feel like you sitting in first class, relax

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
They ask for it
So I put TV's in the headrest and the dashboard
You got to catch it on tape cause when the truck stops
The rims still look like they on fast-forward, unh
Damn, I'm sipping liquor the colour of Smurf skin
As long as the earth spins, and you'll get seasick
And my waves be thick enough for them Cali dudes to surf in, cowabunga!
Your low riding denims look like midgets is hiding in them
They say I like it from the front, they like it from the back
But when the kids is sliding in them, they be screaming (Damn)
The biggest dykes these switching for dudes for figures like me
And um I'm not bragging
But imagine that you could even fuck with a nigga like me

[Hook]



Ha ha ha ha ha
See ma, I think you took it
I think you took it wrong like
You got it misunderstood or something
You got it confused

You was turned on by the moonshine and the sunlight bling
You kept licking your tongue at me, knowing how quick that this young'n be
To pull out his dick from his dungarees
Besides, we had enough liquor and jungle trees
That both of us woulda got sick or had lung disease
I remember every gesture made (ooh)
During the escapade (ooh)
In the back of the Escalade (whoa)
When it come to tricks, I have some up my sleeve (uh huh)
But Shorty dived in head first and didn't come up to breathe (shit)

This girl hobby was to slob me down (uh)

In the pent house blasting Mobb Deep and some Bobby Brown (uh huh)
Do not disturb sign probably woulda not be found (yeah)
If theres one thing I'm giving her, it gotta be back shots (uh)
She screaming like she just won the lottery jack pot (ahhh) (uh)
At the same time she jerking and wiggling (uh huh)
Smirking and giggling (ha ha ha)
Cuz I'm like Dirk when I'm digging in (uh)
The way she working and figuring
She must have be a gymnast
Cuz the positions wasn't hurting her ligaments
Ma I know you got centerfold measurement features (uh huh)
But after a nut, it was a pleasure to meet ya (uh huh)
Get ya under and outta wear (uh)
You ain't gotta go home, but you gotta get outta here
So write your number on this paper (uh)
I might wanna scrape ya (uh)
Next year when I go on TOUR

I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together
That I'd cherish the love I thought would last forever
Call meee (Na, I don't do this. You already knew this, ma we been thru this)
Call meee (Na, I can't do that, once I done blew that)

Now I ain't seen Shorty since the spot last summer
And she still calling and paging (what the fuck)
I don't even know how she got my numbers (damn)
But I been hiding (uh huh)
Cuz, this girl looking for the kid like Bush was searching for Bin Laden (damn)
Before I didn't care if she where I be (ut uh)
But now I mean it be scaring me (uh huh)
To get year of free therapy (uh huh)
She said her heart broken; it caused her to start smoking (uhhh)
And the hours of deep thinking, making her keep drinking (uhhh)
Since Hiedi started stalking me (uh huh)
I hadda get body guards to walk with me (yeah)
If you wanna get Fabolous, that's on you, that's on you (okay)
Long as you know they at on you (I said okay)

Hoping that this don't turn into a fatal attraction (ut uh)
She screaming "fabolous give me one more chance
Fabolous give me one more chance" PLEASE?!

I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together
(I mean, when was this ma?)
That I'd cherish the love I thought would last forever

Call meee (Na, I don't do this. You already knew this, ma we been thru this)
Call meee (Na, I can't do that, once I done blew that. Ma we been thru that)



[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Uh, Uh, Uh
Baby girl
You know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litagations
And I respect you gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank you
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin lineup ain't playin right
I come off the bench with her
It might sound like I'm gassin you
But it take time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creepin and sneakin
Just to keep it from leakin
We so deep in our freakin
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey's a little bit uptight
Wonderin why I keep coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight
But I said it'll be alright

[Hook: Mike Shorey & (Lil Mo)]
I really wanna be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (no)
And I know I'll live in wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life (want in my life)
I already got a wife (got a wife)
I can't leave you alone (no)
And I know I'll live in wrong
But I can't let you go

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
You ain't never step out of line
Or get out of pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gone play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry about you tellin the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin I denied
Something I would slide
Just to do somethin in the ride
But shorty, there's something you provide
Cause the entree ain't as good without somethin' on the side you know?

[Hook]
I really wanna be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (no)
And I know I'm living wrong
But i can't let ya go
Your the one i want in my life (want in my life)
Already got a wife (got a wife)
Can't leave you alone (no)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Uh
Uh oh, I might be leavin the earth soon
My girl gone kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume
It's gonna be a clip tossed if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me with an empty Magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the car celly
You seen what happened with Mr. Biggs and R Kelly uh

[Lil' Mo]
You know I care for you (care for you)
Anytime this chick is there for you (there for you yea)
These feelings I'm a share with you
Which makes it a little more clear for you

[Hook]
I really wanna be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (no)
And I know I'll live in wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life (want in my life)
I already got a wife (got a wife)
I can't leave you alone (no)
And I know I'll live in wrong
But I can't let you go
I really wanna be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (no)

(Fabolous)
(hahahaha)
Yeah, I'm a Ghetto Superstar nigga
Most niggas trying to get one chick, right?
I'm trying to get two
You know, two is always better than one, right?
Yeah..

(Verse)
I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone
It's 151's prone, that have you and hun's stoned
Trying the unknown
Doing things I know y'all parents wouldn't con-done
It's you, her and me; eyes too blurred to see
Speech too slurred to G
But you know "Young'n" would love ta
See ya upon each other, feeling on me while tongue'n each other
Wow! it's a wonderful thing
To have a pretty female under each wing
The cake can prob'ly Pollie, both of these Bobby Darlies
That take off their Rockavalis?
My job is narly from getting slobbed on Harley's
Getting smoke from the supplier, robbin' Marley
I hope this ain't tooking wrong
But ma now I wanna see how both of y'all look in thongs

(Chorus)
I got a bad bitch on my left side (oww)
Bad bitch on my right side (okay)
I suggest it be best if we get by
Said a bad bitch on my left side (oww)
Bad bitch on my right side (okay)
I suggest it be best if we get by

(Verse)
I'm willing to geese 'em if they feeling a threesome
I'm pulling up in the GT before the dealers release them
I ain't with the blazay blah
Cause I hold the record for the most Menage ' Trois and lama taje (?)
I got a bad chick on my left lap
Bad chick on my right lap
Do as I suggest, I confess
At my request they gon' get right
So when you see lipstick on both cheeks
That mean I slip dick in both freaks
They started calling me Two Time Johnny
After repeatedly leaving the club wit two damn mami's
This brother done had 'em
From close friends, the girls all know each other from Adam
I'm always this humble boo, HELL YES!
It's cool for your girlfriend to come through too

(Chorus)

(Verse)
At the most it'll take an hour together
To get these girls from dancing wit each other
In to taking showers together
They know, it's a studio in Fab crib
One of y'all can rock the mic while the other one ad libs
Boo, my government is personal
But I got enough sets of twins to make Doublemint commercials
After trying X, I can only imagine what y'all be trying next
The stacks that I be splurging have girls in the back of the Excursion
Forgetting bout the fact that they was virgins
I don't care who you bringing wit you
Just let her know that I'm poking her while I'm fingering you
I love that thing that you do
And I know about the tongue and nipple
But I ain't know you had a ring in it too
I can tell when they came, cause they start spelling my name
Like F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S (oww)

(Chorus)

[Fabolous & Paul Cain]
Yeah, yo Cain (what up nigga)
Why wouldn't these bitches love us nigga?
Why wouldn't these niggas hate us huh?
(Why wouldn't they Fab?)
Yeah, (Desert Storm), uh, yeah, uh

[Fabolous]
Why wouldn't I talk as greasy as cheese steak meat
In a strawberry Range, pie crust piping on the cheesecake seats
I'm known for hittin' women's soft spots
With princess cut canaries the size of lemon cough drops

[Paul Cain]
I'm right behind 'em in the Porsche drop
Linen soft top, sick chain with 20 point rocks
Take your bitch, why wouldn't I?
The whip got chrome shoes, cream leather seats with old wooden sides

[Fabolous]
Uh, yeah, what's really poppin', usually boys know
This ghetto superstar with the Bruce Lee-roy glow
Niggas has to hate the outcome (yeah)
Plus I'm in a throwback from the same year they assassinated Malcolm

[Paul Cain]
Make so much ends, I got to find faster ways to count 'em (yeah)
A minute on the block, how fast I make a thousand? (Cain)
That nigga you love to hate, still hug blocks and bubble weight
All for the love of cake

[Fabolous]
Baby girl, why wouldn't fellas stop ya?
After we come through the hood in helicopters (yeah)

[Paul Cain]
The dro I got in this wood, is hela-proper
We do the damn thing, how could they tell us not too

[Hook: Fabolous & Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't this joint make you wanna dance?
Why wouldn't these jewels make you wanna glance?
(Why wouldn't this whip make you wanna ride?
And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?)
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you wanna hate?)
Why wouldn't I what?

[Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't I pull up to the spot, yellow Azure (ok)
Dressed in yellow linen, covered in Canaries never a flaw (uh huh)
Why shouldn't I wear this much ice
The princesses in my ear, are clear and cut right
Why wouldn't I talk this slick (why not?)
With a watch and bracelet this flooded, and a cross this sick?
So why wouldn't I get at hoes (I mean)
To a nigga gettin' money like myself, a little brain that's minimal (yeah)
Might talk but I live it though, sick chain glitter roll
Never sleep and don't stop gettin dough

[Fabolous]
Uh, hold up Cain, uh, why wouldn't I have samples of raw (uh huh)
In Akademik sample velours
Hypnotic samples to pour
The European sample Azure
Wheel on the right side 'B' with the wings stamped on the door
It's the street family boss, I land by the shores
Get pampered by whores, eat scampy and claws
The kid's been trampeled before by a tramp with no flaws
That's up to they get cramps in they jaws
I keep tefs jammed in the four
Amp weed to draw, end up in a wheelchair ramp by your door

[Hook: Fabolous & Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't this joint make you wanna dance?
Why wouldn't these jewels make you wanna glance?
(Why wouldn't this whip make you wanna ride?
And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?)
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you wanna hate?)
Why wouldn't I huh? Why wouldn't I what?

[Fabolous]
After a million scanned on it (yeah)
Why wouldn't the Range look like it got 20-inch ceiling fans on it (woo)
Only reason you in my face ma'am
Is cause I got the same Nikes that Jordan had on in "Space Jam"

[Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't I chase chips
Come through Aves, like "Pluto Nash" in Coupes that look like spaceships
Ridiculous bracelet and the outrageous
Watch with flawless rocks, invisible placement

[Fabolous]
Uh, I oughta feel like a boss (uh huh)
Why wouldn't I get a 100 an appearance, quarter mil a endorse
I oughta feel some remorse
Cause I'm killin' 'em out there, and a stick shift sport utility Porsche

[Paul Cain]
Yeah, I know when you see us, it be pissin' you off
Cause you would think we paid a fortune for the shit that we floss
Spend summers in my Sicily loft
Whole crib, interior decoration done by Christian Dior
(Baby girl), I got cops thats on the payroll
Jet skies, and speed boats docked up in Barbados

[Fabolous]
Green and cream Tims, brocolli and potatoes
Why wouldn't you see the Storm for the rocks and these tornadoes

[Hook] - 2X

Give them nick names and a little bit of vodka

You know who got the gold like the kid from "The Last Dragon"
You know who got the low on the spokes and the ass saggin'
You know who got the gold that'll have your ass gaggin'
You know who got the boat that'll have the task naggin'
But I fuck bitches, and get money

Ya'll better call the D's up before I reload now
I'm "The Boss" something like Springsteen

I ride in a seven series with Tommie's
I make another on of America's hotties
And I'm that serious mommy
I'm the one, like the Jet Li flick
The private jet ski's sick
The motors on the jet ski's quick
The clips in the sets be thick
And I done slipped more shots in than Gretzky's stick
I'm the one like Penny Hardaway's number
That's why dudes say it's hard to keep my broad away from ya
Once your bitch, get the god 2-way number
It'll be hard to get a Happy Father's Day from ya
I'm the one, like the piece that's on Nelly's chain
You can't reach me, I'm out of your celly range
Bitch I'll even put canary's up in your belly chain
And just to beat the traffic, hop in a helly main

[Hook]



[Intro: Fabolous]
Hey-hey-hey yo {3x}
F-A-B
Hey-hey-hey yo {2x}
F-A-B
Hey-hey-hey yo {2x}

[Verse: Fabolous]
Ain't no tellin' what this hpno' will do to me
I'm feelin' like I can do what I want now
Dip-low immunity
Shorty! just shake your hips slow and move wit me
Take a hit a this and sip slow and thoroughly
You're sneakin' out on your man, tip-toein' to the V
Cause I know you got him whipped though like wannabe
Let's put on a live strip show just you and me
But girl, I'm lookin' at them lips though like who is he?
They ain't never seen a whip, clothes or jewelry
So when I ask "you wanna leave the zip-code?"
Say "sure" and be me

[Hook 1: Fabolous]
But this is my party
Stroll by if you want to
Or ya'll can stay home
But why would you want to?

[Verse: Fabolous]
We gon' party, till we laid in graves
Sweat out our doobie braids and waves
Then scream "hey-hey-hey yo"
That groupie made a wave
Cause when she seen the whips and chains
She started talking 'bout she ready to be made a slave, c'mon

[Hook 2: Fabolous] (2x)
This is my party
So get fly if you like to
Get high if you like to cause I know you like to
Put your hands up as high as you like to
And if it feels good scream "hey-hey-hey yo"

[Verse: Fabolous]
I don't know about y'all
But we doin' it over here
All the glasses got liquid that blue in it over here
Cigars got somethin' sticky that's glueing it over here
Ladies movin' it over there, movin' it over here
I can fit a few in a Rover's rear
We havin' a good time, don't ruin it overs this
You see why we asks is to see ID
Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access
Me I relax this (easy)
Cause I'm used to ballin'
You could tell that these guys need practice
But if it was a problem then I would confront you
You saying "no" but ya eyes say you want to
But a pitcher that probably slugs, pitches and talk a put
I ride wit the top down and switch to the top-up look
Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook
Their asses pokin' out like them pictures in pop up books

[Hook 2]

[Verse: Fabolous]
Oh yea! We's off the Richter Scale
Hate will get you, put in coffins quick as hell
If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell
For my hustlers knockin' off them bricks as well
And everybody, up north that's sick in jail
I probably feel y'all, send you all of the flicks in mail
The Street Family speed off in six SL's
To all them chicks that yell "hey-hey-hey-hey yo"
Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well
Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell
And just from lookin' at them thighs from the front view
Girl I know that these guys say they want you
If I wake up in the sand, clothes from yesterday
Same hoes from yesterday
Lightin' clips to the same dro' from yesterday
Her hang-overs yesterday
You ain't mistaken we in Benz's today
But we had them Range Rovers yesterday

[Hook 2]

[Outro: Fabolous] (to fade)
Hey-hey-hey yo...
Hey-hey-hey yo...



[Intro: Fabolous & Ashanti]
Baby girl (I really like)
Desert Storm (yeah)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now, I want to be more than a friend of you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90's into 2 thou
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vow's
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'mma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikini's in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave. shoppin' spree's, and them dinners to Chow's]
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous, it's the principle now
I'm so into you

[Chorus: Ashanti]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Come on ma, it's more than a flashin'
I woulda traded it all, in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashin'
Just off the shore, so you can hear when water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks you be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin
Would have me with the blue's so hard, you would think I was crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxin' when you spend
Ever since you've been askin' 'bout the friends
How'd you like it if, both our name's had Jackson on the ends, uh

[Chorus: Ashanti]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becomin' too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Bart, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah

[Chorus: Ashanti]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

[Outro: Ashanti]
Ohhhh, no no no no no nooooo
Oooohhhh no no
So into you

You know what?
Everybody goes through some changes in life
Some people change for the better, some people change for the worse
But umm, some people need to make that change
You know what I mean? Change is good sometimes. You know?

[Verse 1]
Why would I change? I ain't never slide down a bat pole
Even though I'm certified over plat's sold
They say I'm different 'cuz I ride in a plat. Rolls
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?
I never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole
And I ain't givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold
No pride, I ain't that old
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ?????
It probably don't seem like a struggle
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?

[Hook]
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you

[Verse 2]
Why would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth
I'm speakin' the known truth
I ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof
Why would I feel like I'm a stranger?
And why should I feel like I'm in danger?
And I'm grindin' 'till I'm right
Whether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites
I ain't blind from the limelite
I had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full
I'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed
Stayin, the same, like I'm, supposed
Ghetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler
One million customers, and I still bust at ya

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks
Known a few ????? and met a few locs
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then
Some have even became rivals instead of friends
Only two become liable for settlements
I grew up watchin the Bed-Stuyvesant veterans
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in
They know the family bring knives and barettas in
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd
How could my head be in the clouds?
It's strange, what the fame'll do
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you

[Hook]

I'm the same nigga man
Same nigga, that ridin' with you
Niggas that's fuckin' with you
I'm still fuckin' with you niggas
The same nigga, these ho's ain't like
Now they on my dick right? Haha... shit is crazy
Don't let this game change you nigga...



Yea, I ain't scared of you motherfuckers
I ain't no killer right
But y'all niggas gon' make me one
For real.. leave me alone, shit
You fuckin with the wrong one brotha
I'm telling ya

I'm sittin in the crib dreamin 'bout killin ya
With machine guns shotties, desert Eag' dillingers
Putting a bullet as big as a battery through a niggas anatomy
And watchin him die slow
You need full clips to push up in the joint
When you in the kinda truck that I push up to the joint
Cuz theses motherfuckas will push him to the point
That you'll end up locked down doin push ups in the joint
But they'll box you in the corner
And you can throw ya fists up and act like you a boxer on his corner
Ride wit ya gun in your glove box instead of on ya
You'll be six feet deep in one of them boxes if you wanna
Not me, I squeeze the clips drop from the handle
Till your remains is in a urn on top of the mantle
Till everybody scramble off the block like they Randall (run)
Till there's a mural on your block and some candles
Who wanna die?

[Hook]
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin punk
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin chump
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin clown
Cuz I'mma have to kill someone just to get some respeck

My teflons will have you screamin like Wyclef Jean
(someone please call 9-1-1)
But if they ever get the watch on my left arm
Ima have Marbury (more buried) than that guy Stephon
First, they put that white sheet over you brother
Then the newspapers put you all over the cover
Then you in a suit one hand cross over the other
Last you in the earth with the dirt over you brother
A tinted hearse is what most men leave in
Followed by a limo full of family and close friends greavin
One pull of marijuana
Ima wanna kill you as bad as The Terminator wanted Sarah Connor
But, I'm loosin my patience
Fuck it, send me to the island I could use a vacation
Now it's easy for me to understand
How you could just kill a man

[Hook]
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin punk
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin chump
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin clown
Cuz I'mma have to kill someone just to get some respeck

I'd rather be
Judged by twelve than carried by the six
My gun ain't on my man or carried by my chicks
My gun ain't in my crib or carried in the six
If I'm right here nigga then its right here nigga
Picture me put in my hearse
Like I ain't gotta clip full of hollow tips to put in these jerks
I might as well put in the work
Spit 'em up outta here then get 'em up outta here
I got the juice, like bishop had wit him
That just don't give a fuck, semi
Like ol' dog had wit him
I'm sayin prayers for my enemy
I hope god bless him, before the fucker run into me
I dunno what the fuck has got into me
But I know I don't want them slugs goin into me
I'm just tryin to live my life
So niggas better give me my respect or give me life

[Hook]
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin punk
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin chump
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin clown
Cuz I'mma have to kill someone just to get some respeck

Look what you made me do man
Look what you made me do man
I didn't want it to come to this, right
But fuck it..
Niggas will push you to that point man
Niggas will play with you so fuckin much man
Aggravate you so fuckin much man
That you wanna kill a nigga man
Yea



Uh, yes I am often imitated
But I am never duplicated, yeah
Yes I am often imitated
But I am never duplicated

(Verse 1)
I can't deny it, you's a dick rider
You can never flow like me, blow like me
Why would a bitch like ya?
She can see that I'm a fuckin rider, you a hitch hiker
I'm walkin in some shoes, they can't make fit ya
Got millions of paper that you can't take with ya
I don't wanna talk and I can't take pictures
Listen to your demo, I'll handshake with ya
Excuse you, who's you?
If I need a stunt double I'll use you
Pardon y'all, I don't wanna step on y'all toes
Seperate the authentic from the replica flows
And the kid be places you could never be at
So that can never be this, and this can never be that
These niggas got some audacity
Sell some records as fast as me
Or sell some tickets out as fast as me
Motherfucker

(Chorus) (x2)
Yes I am often imitated (yes he is often imitated)
But I am never duplicated (but he is never duplicated)

So all that y'all can do is hate it

(Verse 2)
None of these wannabes really come close
I feel like I'm watchin the MTV show Christina Milian hosts
Everybody know this brother got it
Way before everybody and their mother got it
They still wonder how he sound like he do
If I was you, I'd wanna sound like me too
Cause I got M's, they got G's and they all right
But they not me
They hear how I spit it on a station
Now they wanna put me on they singles just to get an imitation
No, I can't make an appearance
Give you a cheap fee or break on a clearance
I'm what your label hoped it could be
That's why they trying to mould your little ass, into a sculpture of me
With the ladies it'll be like leader, she like real
Y'all trying to be like me and be like ill

(Chorus) (x2)

So all that y'all can do is hate it

(Verse 3)
I'm real
It's the way I talk, the way I walk
It ain't my fault
I won't let nothin' on two legs stop me
Cause the real is always better than the bootleg copy
Like I ain't show 'em the white and yellows at the same time
Throw backs and pin wheels at the same time
Like I'm scared to drop at the same time
I'll show you how to do this young'n
I ain't frontin'
These Jordan's ain't comin'
It ain't nothin'
Keep the complaints comin'
Can't hop on my bandwagon
Jump in my blue flames
You should not try, you are not I
It's the dude with the Grammy grin
It's no relation if it ain't a street family kin
So won't the real Fabolous please stand up
Please stand up
Please stand up

(Chorus) (x2)

So all that y'all can do is hate it



[Mary J. Blige]
(*harmonizing*)
All my love is all I have
All my life I look for you

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
I'm just Fab, I see how Mary be now
But I can barely be found
And I rarely be round
But when I do, the jury be drowned
And you can see how clear the Pavees, and the Canaries be now
The top on the 5 series be down
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now
Although there was a time I would barely see thous
But I'm gettin a multi-million dollar yearly fee now
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds
I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now
Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round
Everybody staring unnecessarily now
But there's no tints on my life, so you can clearly see now

[Hook - Mary J. Blige]
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today your dream come true
You need me and I need you
Lovin us is very special
Lovin life and life and livin
Your very special

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
Ya'll can never be built like me, even if ya'll look at my blueprint
But since ya'll watches look like its movement
I'll show you how video games look on the new Sprint
Flip out digital screens, look in the new Bent
100 and flat screens, look in the new Pint
Even our Air Forces lookin' to new tints
I stay away from anythin that look like a nuisance
But ya'll gotta peep this rookie's improvement
I tip it with you and
Cause most dudes was doin verses for a few dollars and a hook for a few cents
All I do is try to teach and look to influence
But it look like the students are playin hooky, and truin
And some say that we lookin' like new gents
But money talks, and it don't look like ya'll fluent
And ya'll done seen how this "Young'n" look in the new pints
But it's my life and you can't look in the new tints

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
Uh, If I could say so myself, I came a long way
Even though I feel like the same old John J
Nothin' change, when I aim, I'm gonna spray
When I eat, I order the same old entree
When I ride, I let the same old songs play
And when I work, I do the same old long days
From bein' Fab, to looked at by dames the wrong way
They know where we came, from the name they call me
I already know what these lames is gonna say
And I already seen what games they gonna play
Fuck with family, don't say the name the wrong way
And when you die, ya'll crackers gonna blame it on strays

[Mary J. Blige]
Cause love and life, and life and livin
Your very special
(*harmonizing*)

[Hook] - w/ variations

(*harmonizing*)
Me and Fab are very special
(*harmonizing*)
Me and Fab are very special



[Fabolous talking]
Dont try to fuck wit me yall
Cause you can't
Uhh, I stay way ahead of the game
Ya know, Catch me if you can nigga
Uhh, Haha

[Verse 1]
Throwback this, Throwback that
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
I rock the Reds Pete Rose when I'm in the 'Natti
And 4X, You can't see the semi-automatti
When I'm in the Chi' you think they ain't that shocked
To see the kid roll through in the St. Pats Socks
So pull out the Chicago and the script to wear on Soul Train
The Bulls, When Mike had hair and a gold chain
I get the Spirit in St. Louis. How could the God lose?
I do back flips in the Ozzie Cardinals
They love me in Cleveland, Everytime I travel there
I'm in the Indians or that Cavaliers
When I hit Minnesota, That kid from Brooklyn wear
The Vikings or the Timberwolves from Garnett's rookie year
And in Milwaukee I had to pimp it and go back
20 years with the Bucks and Brewers throw backs

[Hook]
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at

[Verse 2]
I might charge through San Diego with the bolts on my shoulder
Rock the Trailblazer warm-up, Cause Portland gets colder
And even the pimps be jealous
When I'm in the floor seat at the Forum in the M.P.L.S
And they be askin' what teams on the kid chest
This the Rams before they moved to the Midwest
When I'm in the Bay with it, I dont play with it
Im in the Athletics with the matchin' A's fitted
This ain't even for the minors
Cause they dont know nothin' bout the Joe Montana, 49ers
Seattle, Probally heard different rumors
Either about the Payton or the Griffey Jr
I come through Denver like 4th quarter with Elway
Or the Nuggets that make them yell Ehhhh
In Phoenix I do the old Suns
Cause the new jerseys is cool, But nothings really like the old ones
Ya know

[Hook]
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at

[Verse 3]
In New York what I wear in the club may vary
Mets or Yankees like the Subway Series
When I'm in Boston I melt the bean
In a hot Red Soxs or Celtics green
In the city of Philly, I roll up on the biddes like feel these
In a size 56 Phillies
In Jersey I got the Nets on
That you can bet on
In D.C. I couldn't pull it
Without the Bullets
When I stop in Atlanta I can't talk long
Them birds know I got the Falcons or the Hawks on
That peach Tampa Bay dont hit the streets too often
Not even Miami could take the Heat of Dolphins
Ain't no complaints on
When I'm in New Orleans with the Saints on
In Houston I pass hoes
In the Astros
In Dallas I always gotta have
The Cowboys or the Mavs
???, To keep it comin, And I'mma keep it comin

[Hook]
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at

[SP] Try to run up on the guy, I'll send your legs to your mom
[JK] And we still got kilos of coke
[SP] Ruff Ryders to the death, ride or die nigga we know the oath
[JK] That's why I'm tryin' to send this metal through your head
Cause you got me curious, you probably look better when your dead
Nine by the spine, (fifth in the holst)
Scum bag it's them D-Block boys, Daddy, Kiss, and the ghost
[SP] Comin' through like the "Matrix" in the A-6
Triple black leather, six-speed, with the gray stick
[JK] Give me the safe, I spit at your face
Double clip in your mug, then have SP hit it with mace
[SP] And we just caught burners and do me I'll say this
[JK] Your little niggas lookin' up to me like the walls in Green Haven
Keep heat and we shank ya
[SP] rob ya and say thank ya

Keepin' it gangsta
My whole crew
Keepin' it gangsta

[Verse 2 - Fabolous, Paul Cain]

[Fabolous]
We your favorite gangstas' favorite gangstas (PC: and duke better bolt)
Before these slugs sink in his waves like anchors
We don't own clean guns
[PC] All our skets is dirty
I toss bullets, New York niggas jet like Testaverde
I don't keep the scope on the ratchet
For the dope I'll attach it
[Fab] Make sure the joint aim point blank so they can't open your casket
My whole crew (got Glocks on 'em)
In a hurry to shoot, (like they put shot clocks on 'em)
All that gossip you blast, better see if they possibly has
A V12 ambulance that get you to a hospital fast
[PC]
They let Cain out the cages and shackles
I ain't call a pager to track you
I'm loadin' up gauges to whack you
We been riding together
And us back and forth
[Fab]
It's like putting Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden together
Soon as you get a crumb, they wanna bury ya
That's why I travel with a semi
Like Eddie in "Coming to America"
[PC]
Silencers, it sound like it's humming when I'm airing ya
Won't know you hit 'til your body numbing in that area
[Fab]
The kids don't want to see the toast to mom and daddy
Plus we rather be roasting trauma fatties
In a toasted almond Caddy
[PC]
And we come through, with chains glisten and thangs spitting
Hollow shots'll leave your brain missing
[Fab]
Ghetto F A B (and Paul Cain nigga)
We gettin heaps of complaints for keepin' it gangsta (keepin' it gangsta)

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - M.O.P.]
[Billy Danze]
Hey yo, we represent them down ass niggas
M.O.P. rip rounds at you clown ass niggas (ALL DAY)
BK nigga get up off snooze
Don't make me put your gangsta on the 6 o'clock news
You ride in a what, don't get it fucked up
Or twisted, cause you'll get it twisted and fucked up
And die in that truck
(Be cautious when your walking through, be careful who you talkingtoo, comes the boom)
It's the livest motherfuckers of the century
You niggas is killing me, you got to be kidding me
Ain't nobody taking it and making it
Extra like dust, throwing they ass on the record and bless it like Gus
Now about them weak flows, keep those, we eat those
As far as heat goes, we keep those, the street knows
The M.O.P. is what's up
We in the cut, Brownsville is heating it up (COME ON)

[Lil' Fame]
Your ego, I still spit lines at your bitch
Play Ceelo, and spit four five's at your six
You don't really wanna lose your life
So I'mma smack flames out ya, pick ya money up and roof ya dice
Yo, you done know were we from
Soldier come soldier jump
Soldier, you bee found in your whip slumped over
With your gangsta ass, dead and your gone
Iced out, chain out, with ya brains out, head on your horn
You know who be keepin' it gangsta
With a truck full of goons that fakesta
And the Brownsville niggas from the past
That run up, put a hammer to ya gut, and tell ya drop it in the bag
You gangsta, ha whatever (haha)
Cause for real if I ever ever
Ever ever catch yo ass flippin'
I'm gonna pop a collar
Woo mack and when your bitch holla

[Hook]



[P. Diddy]
Yeah, yeah, this the moment they all been waiting for playboy
We here now, we in the house now, fa sho'
Check me out, I'm tired of playing games

[Hook: Jagged Edge]
Girl I'd trade it all, money cars, and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, babygirl I'd trade it all

Diddy: Fabolous, talk to 'em

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I assume I'm so into you
Cause even before we hit the bedroom I was friends wit you
If they ask, I ain't got to say "whom?" in them interviews
My sweet thing never believe the rumors, that been ain't true
The fact I had numerous friends is true
But you was wifey, could change me to a groom in a minute boo
Maybe, my sense of humor gets into you
But girl, they could make a perfume from the scent of you
I wanna take you where it feel like June in December too
So what you think about Cancun 'til the winter through?
I don't know what the other consumers you been with do
I put a day aside, to go to Bloomy's and spend with you
Like any other man, I wanna zoom to the clinic too
But I wanna see if me and my junior's identical
A dude put a wound on the skin of you
I swear to everything, that same afternoon, I'll be in the news
Feel me?

[Hook: repeat 2X w/ changes]

[Verse 2: P. Diddy]
C'mere girl, come and take a walk with me
So I can take you places you don't often be
C'mon ma, come and get lost with me
As far as them other chicks, can't get them off of me
Everlastin', love in a whole 'nother fashion
All I'm askin, is let me cash in
Cause I'd give all the passion, all of the Sean John fashion
In orderly fashion, perhaps when
You figure out, exactly what Diddy 'bout
Cause we could take this whole city out
Now who gon' stop us, who gon' knock us?
Top us, we can't find coppers to lock us
Lear jets and choppers, love hella proper
Seperate the weak from the obso-lete, hard to keep, I got ya
I rocked ya, word to Big Poppa, I got ya, yeah

[Hook] - repeat 2X

Fab: What you want huh?
Diddy: I'm ready to give this all up for you shorty
Get your mind right

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Well this newcomer's known, to move with the seasons
Couple winter lodges, few summer homes
I'm there for every "ooh", "um", and moan
And make sure when the new Hummer roams, the shoes come in chrome
I ain't new at buying white, yellow, and cucumber stones
That send chills through a woman bones, but life gets gruesome alone
Even though I got the kinda bread that won't matter if a few crumbs are blown
Flights, I done flew some alone
Now I wanna wake up everyday with you in a new number zone
Mama mia, it's you I'mma phone
Just to erase all the negative views from your dome
And I promise this fellas G, it's so gangsta it'll calm all that jealousy
And drama you tellin me, so mama come yell at me
So I can put the top down, and we can "Cruise/Cruz" like Tom and Penelope
My charm is a felony.......

[Hook] - repeat to fade

Diddy: Fabolous, Diddy, Desert Storm, we rock on, and rock on



[Intro: Tamia]
I think you're truly something special (Ooooh)
Just what my dream are really made of (Dreams are really made of)
Let's stay together you and me boy (Ooo-ooo-ooh)
There's no one like you 'round, oh baby
Oh, I wanna love you, yeah yeah

[Fabolous & Tamia]
Uh, baby girl (Yeah, yeah)
Uh, uh, (Ooh)
Desert Storm, uh (Ooo-ooh)
Uh, uh huh, uh, uh huh, uh (Ooo-ooh)
Yeah, yeah, oh, uh

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now, I want to be more than a friend of you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90's into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vow's
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'mma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikini's in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave. shopping spree's, and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous it's the principle now, I'm so into you

[Hook: Tamia]
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Come on ma, it's more than a flashin'
I woulda traded it all, in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashin'
Just off the shore, so you can hear when water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks he be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin'
Would have me with the blue's so hard, you would think I was crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxin' when you spend
Ever since you've been askin' 'bout the friends
How'd you like it if, both our name's had Jackson on the ends, uh

[Hook: Tamia]
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becoming too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Bart, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah

[Hook: Tamia]
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you

[Outro: Tamia]
I, really like (Ooo-ooo-ooh)
What I feel, when I'm with you (With you)
You're a dream come true (You're, oh yeah, yeah)
Don't you ever leave my side (Ever leave my side, oh no)
Cause it feel so right (Oh baby, oh I)

[Hook: Tamia]
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you

(Fabolous talking)
Dont try to fuck wit me yall
Cause you can't
Uhh, I stay way ahead of the game
Ya know, Catch me if you can nigga
Uhh, Haha

(Verse 1)
Throwback this, Throwback that
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
I rock the Reds Pete Rose when I'm in the 'Natti
And 4X, You can't see the semi-automatti
When I'm in the Chi' you think they ain't that shocked
To see the kid roll through in the St. Pats Socks
So pull out the Chicago and the script to wear on Soul Train
The Bulls, When Mike had hair and a gold chain
I get the Spirit in St. Louis, How could the god lose
I do back flips in the Ozzie Cardinals
They love me in Cleveland, Everytime I travel there
I'm in the Indians or that Cavaliers
When I hit Minnesota, That kid from Brooklyn wear
The Vikings or the Timberwolves from Garnett's rookie year
And in Milwaukee I had to pimp it and go back
20 years with the Bucks and Brewers throw backs

(Chorus)
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at

(Verse 2)
I might charge through San Diego with the bolts on my shoulder
Rock the Trailblazer warm-up, Cause Portland gets colder
And even the pimps be jealous
When I'm in the floor seat at the Forum in the M.P.L.S
And they be askin' what teams on the kid chest
This the Rams before they moved to the Midwest
When I'm in the Bay with it, I dont play with it
Im in the Athletics with the matchin' A's fitted
This ain't even for the minors
Cause they dont know nothin' bout the Joe Montana, 49ers
Seattle, Probally heard different rumors
Either about the Payton or the Griffey Jr
I come through Denver like 4th quarter with Elway
Or the Nuggets that make them yell Ehhhh
In Pheonix I do the old Suns
Cause the new jerseys is cool, But nothings really like the old ones
Ya know

(Chorus)
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at

(Verse 3)
In New York what I wear the the club may vary
Mets or Yankees like the Subway Series
When I'm in Boston I melt the bean
In a hot Red Soxs or Celtics green
In the city of Philly, I roll up on the biddes like feel these
In a size 56 Phillies
In Jersey I got the Nets on
That you can bet on
In D.C. I couldn't pull it
Without the Bullets
When I stop in Atlanta I can't talk long
Them birds know I got the Falcons or the Hawks on
That peach Tampa Bay dont hit the streets too often
Not even Miami could take the Heat of Dolphins
Ain't no complaints on
When I'm in New Orleans with the Saints on
In Houston I pass hoes
In the Astros
In Dallas I always gotta have
The Cowboys or the Mavs
Tell Pete To keep it comin, And Imma keep it comin

(Chorus)
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at



Maybe cause I'm eatin
And these bastards fiend for they grub
I carry pumps like I serve gasoline to these scrubs
Have you seen my Aston leanin on dubs
And they can't afford chrome so they puttin Vaseline on they hubs
I'm lookin for a girl with a ass like Trina to rub
Take home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub
These niggas hate I move as smooth as castor cream in the club
And dont pass my green or my bub
But I'm a fly nigga that don't do much to pull her and dick her
Everyday I'm poppin a tag and pullin a sticker
Everyday I'm switchin the tags and pullin up sicker
Every "K" I'm loadin the mags with bullets to flicker
And I ain't hesitatin homie I'm pullin it quicker
So you can act tough After a few pulls of some liquor
Gotta pull it on niggas
And they won't be goin nowhere for a while
They might as well pull out a snicker Ye-Ye-Yea

[Hook]
Forgive me father for I have sinned
But look at all this money that I spend
And look at all this jewlery that I'm in
And look at all the places that I've been
And look at all the women in those brims
Look at the blue flames that I'm in
I look at all the bullshit that theres been
And if I had another chance I'd do it again

[Verse 2]
Anywhere the kid move you know the hammers'll be with me
Pokin out the shirt like a Pamela Lee titty
I went on tour brought the samples of D wit me
Came back a month later bought a Lambo for three-fifty
Think I throw you grams if you read with me
Just because you see me on the camera with P. Diddy
Dammit we P-driddy?? Now I got G with me
Along with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties
I keep the revolver you hope my gun'll jam
But with the scope its gonna blam
The infra put freckles on your face like Opie Cunningham
Thats why I'm watched by the Feds and scoped by Uncle Sam
Dope and hunn-ed (hundred) grams rope and hunn-ed grams
At the same time an artist get to open Summer Jam
Hope you understand or use better sense
These niggas dont want no beef they want lawsuit settlements Nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm in a waggy when I'm passin by ya
With a baby girl who suck harder than Maggie on a pacifier
What I'm smokin'll have you aggie as your last supplier
When you can smell it through the baggie you know that's some fire
Gettin stressed by these hotties is regular
I got a magazine to press to your body like editors
Test me somebody I'm beggin ya
I got the gatling gun like Jesse The Body in Predator
I'm a hustler I dont sling no rocks to the fiends now
Got dudes who sit on corners like a boxer between rounds
Any other dude who dish rocks want beef
Cause I chop dimes bigger than Chris Rock front teeth
I'm the nigga tearin the walls up in your miss in exchange for a small cup
Of the Cris
And while you at probation fillin a small cup full of piss
I'm in a coupe with a roof that ball up like a fist (Catch up!)



(Chorus x2)
Still ridin clean, makin cheese, and gettin my dick sucked
Still makin cheese, ridin clean, and gettin my dick sucked

(Project Pat)
I swear I'm going through a thang but I gotta snap back
Give it all to God its tha pistol put tha crack back
Stayin on my job dealin wit hatas wit a jap slap
Dealin wit this mob police watchin studio phone tapped
You best believe that I could see ya from a mile away
Thought that my girl was down sleepin wit tha enemy
Tha streets are dangerous I could be dead anyday
That's why I'm ridin wit my dog smokin plenty hay
This shit contagious doin dope and its killin me
Even though I know I hit tha snow is you feelin me
I'm lookin good twenty-three's on that flippin paint
Them twelve golds in my mouth makin these bitches faint
Now can't a nigga see I ain't got no time for games
I'm on this Hennessey and I'm quick to shoot dat thang
But fuck dat one of my young niggas'll take tha charge
I'm stackin loot muthafuck lookin behind some bars

(Chorus x4)

(Project Pat)
Out slangin brickas tha project nigga row-a
A playa that's fa show-a I'm chargin a ho-a
You weak niggas know-a you step and I fire
Yo life will expire you need to retire
Yo bitch call me sire she flat like a tire
Shot nut in her eye-a on that I don't lie-a
Tha fact of tha matter she blow out tha frizzame
I keep me some powder so I'm gettin brizzain
I'm out dodgin felonies and fuck dat coke
Cause a nigga lovin these streets and that's of course
Mane I hate to see tha judge face and that's fa sho
Prayin that he'll drop the case and let me go
Cause I like smokin good green Motel-io
Stick my dick in a ho's mouth and there I go
Getting drunk off of liquor and smokin this dope
Put tha green in tha Swisher I'm gettin blowed

(Chorus x4)

(Juicy J)
You know who you are you hatin ass bitch
You tried to change yo name but you can chew on my dick

Wanna walk up to this pimp and get a hole in ya tensions
Always talkin 'bout the Juice ho I been on tha town

[DJ Paul]

That was my style as a juvenile
I ran with gangs nigguhs I slanged
But in the meanwhile
I hang with b.a.z rockers rockers on twenty-three chrome
You got your gun on you

Cause six is blasting nice and fast
And better clean your glasses

And put you to sleep like a certa mattress
You soft like pussy
So i guess thats why you smell like one
Bitch fuck alone
You better go and get your fucking gun
I'll have you begging for a double dose of percoscent

Snortin all your dope up claiming that you in the game

Round the way with the sk edward norten lay

But when my tones in your face you say bye bye

[Project Pat]
Nigguhs love to see this hate on the ten o clock news
Project pat got arrested by them boys in blues
He must be guilty of sin  send his ass to the pen
God have mercy on his boys so i'm back here again
Nigguhs lie to they dawgs bout the shit that they do
Point blank range one in chain when i aim staraight at you
When i squeez on this trigguh its uh ooh spaghetti o's
The holo hit you and the bloody run down your nose
Kidnap a suckuh put the duck tape around his mouth
A snitching fucker and he knows whos i'm talkin bout
The nina popping and i'll put you permandisly
Push you in river with some bricks wrapped around your feet
Cause when its ana' best believe we gon' bring the heat
With extra clips cause we do not except defeat
I'm busting rounds and your chest will see cave'uhment
Then get on down when your body hit pave'uhment

[Chorus]

Backseat action riverside relaxin'
Flick in the DVD that ass I'm waxin'

[Hook]

Oh I, I choose you baby

(Project Pat)

Hundred spoke rims sittin' slick on the Escalade
Couldna been the king of heart mane baby got me paid
First of the year tax time keep me wit' a smile
I'mma get a extra couple g's claimin' yo' child
Yeah that's why I know
This is the world that we living in
Don't get hot, stay up off my game, and quit meddling
Pedalin' in these weed sacks
Nigga give me feedback
I don't need no stems dog
You can get the seeds back
Always been a hustla
That's were shit is diggin'
Do just like I tell her to
And wit' no renegging
Her lips and my brain
We can go a long way
On her arm my name
Got that for her birthday
I say that's the only way I gotta have it
Branded for life
All the ass I'mma grab it

[Hook]



[Hook]
Smokin out like Chief Wahoo hoo
Chase it down with the liquor and brew brew
Pass it round that's the way we do do
Somebody get this dope cause I'm through through

[Project Pat]
Roll up a blunt like light up the green
Eyes red as fire I'm on promethazine
Roll up another one dipped in the sizzurp
Save it for later mane cause it wouldn't h-izz-urt
Soon as the thunder enters my lungs-ah
I start gettin hungry wheres that bologna
Crackers and cheese zuzus and whams
Icy white honey bun ooohh there I am
Go an light another one constantly smokin'
Turn up a 45 drankin and chokin
Started smoking weed real young with my peers
So full of dope smoke comin out my ears
Burnt fingernails ain't made no sales
Ya'll might be short an ounce or two on them scales
To hell with that fool go an take a pull
We cheefin all night and we stay gettin food

Chorus x2

[Lord Infamous]
You ask if Lord were a drug a drug
Ay what drug would Lord be he be
Yo Lord would be a pound of weed
But no stems no sticks no seeds
It's just because I believe-ah in cannabis sativa
In my L-U-N-G-S I keep the sticky green-ah
Puffahontas puff a peace pipe ridin on my peet-ah
Whats my favorite flower? It's that marijuana leaf-ah
I keep-ah, uh, the L the O the R the D
I be on the B-L the U-N-T
I brew a cup of shrooms and break down the B-A-G ah
Purple kush pretty bush Cheech n Chong in me-ah
I'm the Scarecrow me in the Ville protecting acres
Smoke it out the bong, a swisher leaf, yes even papers

Chorus x2



[Hook 1] 2x
Northside ho, Southside ho
Eastside ho, Westside ho

[Hook] 2x
Where dem gang, gang signs (show ya golds, show ya golds)
Where dem hood, hood signs (throw some 'bows, throw some 'bows)

[DJ Paul]
It's the return of the gangsta - like my niggas OutKast
Smokin' on the dank-a - shut ya mouth, I might pass
Niggas off the heezy, fuck all at the fuckin' bar
On the floor or in the parking lot they throw it out the car
If they throw the wrong sign - niggas better handle it
Fuck goin' outside - right here you gettin' wet
I'm glad for this here, all I know is this here
And you thinkin' I'mma let you disrespect this shit here
Before I blow a nigga ass off - him and his ho
Ready to rob me a bitch and get the fuck out the do'
This shit is real dumb nigga, who fucka say we playin'
Boy you in the wrong land, fuckin' wit a grown man
It's: "MAFIA, MAFIA" from the beginning into ending
While you grinnin' I whoop yo ass, bitch in one inning
You know the biz, Three 6 is the name boy
You heard my sign now won't you show me what you claim boy

[Hook] 4x

[Juicy J]
We up all night, we smokin' that shit
Somebody run they mouth and then we bop on the bitch
They called us niggas, we run in packs
Some playa hate this skin because the color is black
We sag our jeans, the ride be clean
Them twanky-twin-twins make them rims be mean
We bracing ahead, we trust in the lead
The fool we don't like is police and the Fed.'s
And if you violate - get that tone to the head
And if ya girl approach us - we'll see her in bed
I'll probably own her flick cause she ain't nothin' to us
A neighborhood chewer-hut, hoodrat, slut
We people on the left - and we folks on the right
We throwin' up them thangs - and we startin' them fights
The swinging we be doin' is a ugly site
We sleep in the morning and we come out at night

[Hook] 4x

[Project Pat]
Fuck around and get gun end, straight up out the pen
From the mane with the sawed-off, lay up off the Gin
You can win if you squeeze first - hollow points disperse
You may leave in an ambulance or inside a hearse
Niggas curse when they get caught, then they go to jail
Took a purse with the gold watch - but I can't make bail
Yeah its sad, but I did the crime, I except the time
Just another broke hood nigga - cheese up on my mind
Grab the nine, wanna make change
Suckers lay it down, Project Pat and them Three 6 niggas who get down
'Bout that loot, let the bullets shoot - get across your grill
I'm a North Memphis dinner thief - all about a meal
And I will still retaliate, all you ones that hate
I'm a rider for Hypnotize, move or wrapped in tape
A survivor so realize, catchin' you on late
In the bushes don't be surprise, you gon' meet your fate

[Hook] 4x

[Hook 2] 2x
...show ya golds, show ya golds
...throw some 'bows, throw some 'bows
...show ya golds, show ya golds
...throw some 'bows, throw some 'bows



Talking...

[Project Pat]
Ho I know you got this loot
Fuck around make me shoot
Up I'm like I'm a rocket
Yea I knock it when I hit them boots
Make that pussy wetter then
Running like a faucet tap
Though we get ya stupid then
Yo face is gonna get a slap
Thorough breds are on the map
Pimps are riding checky tramps
Prostituting straight up looting table dances in ya lap
Keep a cough drop in ya cap
Like the way that booty flap
Nine hundred every night so you know that pussy snap
Take me off the weight of fame
Im'a let you run ya game
But if it don't profit us that'll bring a pimp to shame
Swang a fist bout a her eye
Kiss my dick never good-bye
Fuck around and break ya leg ho if ya tell a lie
Biggest booty in the club-ah
I'm the dad you the mother
Out here corning like no other
You's a freaky muthafucka
What they used to say to ya
Hooker now they paying ya
Me & you done falled off broke yea thats what they praying for

Chorus (2x):

You don't never wanna try (This Pimp this pimp)
I'll bust ya head you tell a lie (Don't trip don't trip)
Im'a look you in ya eye (And take grip and take grip)
You get wrong you recieve (A fat lip a fat lip)

[Verse 2]
I'm bout to whip on this maggot means nothing bitch
Got a cute little face and a tight little switch
Getting rich off the chick'ill never happen in a milli-ion
Tired just from now cuz she a civilian
Not a soldier to this army'ill make ya change
Come up shorter and your face Im'a re-arrange
You was looking strange but your pockets looking stranger
I was bumpin me some ruffin in the changer
Swollen eyes busted lips but you know I'm loving you
In the club shakin hips everyday I'm cussing you
Bitch I'm never trusting you thats because I'm smart ho
Other niggas give ya cheese they ain't got no heart though
Ho I'm gonna start yo ass with empty purse
Break you like a cash register then put in hearse
Conscience to the grave and I hope that you can see
That I must get paid if you wants to fuck with me

Chorus (2x)

[Verse 3]
Peter pipper beat the bitch
Sweeped her in the conflict
Through the town spit his game
Introduced her to a trick
Make-up ho like a queen
Cooking cakes candy rings
Feeling up her pussy hole
Rub her for the dingalings
But the ho didn't meet her quarter
So I walked out in an order
Break away from getting slapped start running for the border
Known to whip you out your draws
Bitch done went & told them laws
Got domestic violent charge in the morning out them bars
Duck niggas hate this shit
Catch'em going quack quack
Try snitching to a bitch trying to hold the mack back
But it ain't gone happen cuz the playas out here rapping
To these hoes laying down the law while I get the cap'n
Head cracking in a brick wall
Got me in a midst brawl
Showing out infront of folk
That'll make me kill ya'll
Muthafuckin ass beat ya down like ya stole something
Turn right around hey ho let me hold something

You don't never wanna try (this pimp this pimp this pimp)



[Intro]

Rising in years we together in this hood life
Struggling together straight praying for the good life
Yo life means more to me then my own do
When you had some beef I went and shot on that whole crew

You's a-lot older then me I'm yo little man
Mane time fly's now we old to older
You done came up flippin pebbles to bolders
Told ya that I'm down with you until the graveyard
Me and you got caught with some work in the same car
You were facing more time then me if behind bars

You got larger heard now you own a crack house
I did two years and they let a nigga back out

Chorus (2x)
Since you's a on nigga on nigga fuck which ya boy

[Verse Two]
Back out on the town and you riding in the jag clean
Hit me with a pound then bought me a chevy thang

You know I got heart and I know you very scary
Carrying alot of weight put in plenty work
Always was down for ya dawg did plenty dirt
Looking like a jerk and ya living like a kingpin
That ain't showing love
I'm about to stick this tone inside ya fucking face
Blow ya brains to the other side
38 dumb dumbs cut like a butter knife
But inside the walls you be soaking up game quick
Fuck that gurellia shit trick I done got slick
Remember ya kept ya dope backyard dawg house
Over there hold gun lap
North Memphis momma house
Looking for the cross that will come up from behind ya
Muthafuck the laws cuz I'm taking what's mine-ah

Chorus(2x)

[Verse Three]
Mom's went to church so I'm jumping over gate fast
You mane was outta town handling buisness
Blew both rockwilders out they misery
You got it fist in good so they coulden't see
Yea it's kind of obvious what I came for
Herion and that white-dust ain't no shame boy
A real robber robs a trick and don't say a word
Got'em for a pound of herion and bout eight birds
Mouth slurred cuz a nigga blowing on some good shit
Celebrating cuz a playa done made a phat lick
Any trick do this to me hollow points fly
Dead in the face right between muthafuckas eye
I be's the nigga busting if we in a brawl
I'm my niggas back up so who we call
Me damn fool cuz he knowing that I buck'em

Chorus(2x)



[Hook x4]

That drank, that drank
That drank will make ya think, sizzurp

[Verse 1]
Sippin' on some purple
I'mma call it yurple
Leaning to the sizzide
Cool like I'm Urkle
Weed got me percule
Eyes tight like girdle
Cruising through the hood slow, something like a turtle
Strapped with them triggas
Hanging, hanging with my niggas
Errybody flossed out cause we stacking figgas
Hoes getting nothing but some of this nutt in-side
Their esophagus bitch you give me something
On this hydrocodine
Or promethazine
Sipping on the sizzurp
Sipping on this leazzing
Macking in my mizzind
I'm staying hizzigh
True to the shit I do & that's till I dizzie
Suckas wanna stizzeal

Do watcha gotta do mane to get a meazzal
Never was a hater
I'mma stay a player
Sipping on this good drank doe everyday

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
Per-per-percocet, xanax I got the best deals
I likes to get powered up off them x-pills
Something to get my swerve on codone dranker
Straight out the North Memphis, Tenn' on them chrome twenkas
Niggas that hate always end up with hot lead
I'm with them killas hanging out and we ain't scared
Just like my niggas down in Dallas mane we already
Swanging that work drink that purple with that erky-jerk
My grill is gold when I smile but ain't shit funny
Like U.G.K. we be hustling for that dirty money
We got them hoes that are pros shaking big booties
Down with their mane getting that dough doing their damn duty
I'm on this drank & this drank got me straight mellow
Most niggas love purple 'surp I prefer yellow
We been on this, on the town since the 70's
Some trill players out the south is who we be's

[Hook x4]



[Project Pat]
Hen hen hen-o-sin
Make a playa sin
Mix it in with the white gin
Here we go again
Project Pat, gotta keep a strap
Haters know I rap
Wanna shoot me in my gold teeth, blow me off the map
I attack like a shark would
Represent this hood
North Memphis nigga, Hollywood
Make it understood
In my blood, ain't no traitness
Or no fakeness
And no hoe couldn't break this
You can hate this

[Crunchy Black]
This bitch that bitch, nigga here's the deal
Crunchy ain't runnin round here fakin deals
Crunchy runnin round here tryna get a mil
While you fakin a deal, it don't cost nothin to be real
All you gotta do is keep that shit real
Don't be runnin round here hollarin you got deals
Don't be runnin round here hollarin that you will kill
It don't cost nothing to be real
But it cost when you kill

[DJ Paul]
I'm bout to crash into you suckaz like the world trade
I'm ridin green Escalade
Full of green grenades
You hoes always hollarin that we be some bitches and shit
But every time I turn around you got our name on your shit
I used to be with them
Mane i'm still with them
You wish you was with them
How the fuck you hate them
When you always claimin them
I think its funny cuz yall faggots be still, callin my studio
Tryna get back, stay who you with, cuz I don't need you hoe

[La Chat]
I call up my niggas, we buck and toss with no mercy hoe
We packin this gauge and decorating you with bullet holes

That leaves me no choice, to grab my Glock and fuck up your wig
You think killa talk
But ain't no kill in your blood boy
That infrared be beamin i got ya scopin behind ya door
You niggas can't take it, you hate the fact that we runnin it
You ain't gotta love it, but you gonna learn to respect it bitch

[Lord Infamous]
Got some syrup in my cup, got some smoke in my mouth
Got some white in my nose, got your bitch on the couch
Got her head in my lap, trick I gotta keep it South
Got a problem with Three Six? gotta blow your brains out
Got the South sewed up
Got the guns, load up
Fuckin with the Scarecrow, that'll get ya blown up
It's a hold up
Everybody fold up
Niggas talk like they tough
But they ain't got no nuts, bitch

[Juicy J]
I'm shootin a dyke in her breast-o
Coward in his chest-o
And this police nigga what we call him Donnie Brasco
If you bitches want war, you can bring it, lets go
When i put this tone in ya face, presto
A killa in a black coat, gonna make a mess tho
Leave ya in the street with a bloody Willie Esco
Drankin on some scotch, and we choppin down that cocoa
Tryna roll some pot in a fuckin optimo (mo)

[Frayser Boy]
Dont you make the wrong move, and you get your ass killed dog
A fake ass nigga but he claimin that he real dog
You ain't got to lie to kick it actin like he down dog
Always lookin like tryna wear a murder frown dog
Don't you get smacked and be gettin off the pavement dog
Don't you make me act a fool with some bad behavior dog
Hypnotize Camp Posse got my fuckin back dog
Frayser Boy'll leave ya stankin pop you with the gat dog

[Project Pat]
I'm watchin out for you polices niggas we tight
This unit rip your head in pieces, I know you feel it
These lyrics just like Mona Lisa's cuz you can sell it
The Posse click tight like feces, I know you smell it
This ghetto hood shit is crucial, just like a murda
You step hoe then we shoot ya, we quick to serve ya
You hate us, then it's mutual, so don't be scared a
The H-C-P'll do ya, mane we gon hurt ya

Verse 1:

Know we keep tha best of green so you know i'm Smokin'
Lotta niggas out here clean so you know i'm scopin'

I ain't wit that scuffin' shit, or wit being broken
Waitin' for a sucka' to slip, yeah that's what I was hopin'
Spotted me a nigga, candy paint, a hundred spokin'
Sippin' on his liquor, wit that blowface on that cokin'

Bullets they will burn, just like lava that is molten
You victims will learn to resist'll get ya croakin'
Always kept a thang and bandana never knowin'
When i have ta git my mane, pull em out and poke em

All up in ya gril,l ya drops it off, cuz I have spoken
I know that you're sick, but lets not git ya momma mopin'
Snatched him out tha car, hit tha gas, dawg it's hissin'
He done came on down, but out his head a patch was missin'


Chorus (2x):
90 days at tha Penna farm, (That ain't shit!)
3 bags and a firearm, (That ain't shit!)
Bogus tags and a bench warrant, (That ain't shit!)
Police all at my mommas home, (That ain't shit!)


Verse 2:
Left tha car on bricks behind Cypress Garden projects
East Memphis where we make the stang, and that's to far bet
Nigga hit up Fred for some rims, he said "whatcha like?"
Sold em to our nigga Bigga Mayne out at Mitchell Heights

Made tha quicky change then we went and bought a pound-pound
Straight ta gangsta's house with no remorse we broke it down-down
20 dollar bags all in north Memphis servin' em up
Ridin' wit these bogus tags, mane, we ain't givin a fuck

Map core, on Chelsea Ave, seen tha sucka that we got
We done sold a bag to his patna' now he lookin hot
Raisin up a pistol dawg and nigga started blastin
I returned tha favor you know me no questions askin

Donuts in tha lot tha niggas pulled off we got blocked in
I hopped out tha car seen tha police and threw the Glock in-
To the Garbage can, they didn't see me but they caught a nigga, Wit them three bags, Gangsta fred wit his steel trigga


Chorus (2x)



Shut ya mouth shut ya mouth shut shut ya mouth bitch (8x)

Went in your jaw and throw these bullets straight at'cha grill
Commits to walking from the scenary I keeps it real
I do no talking just stupitity I let ya squeal
You get the squaking up in yo yard with the wood dogg
38 barking see yo tounges and the root of evil
Thats in the bible dig and dirt there should be no sequel
Thats to your title rumors leakin out like a faucet
Stank like a burger with some onions or some hot gossip for that I murda

Chorus (4x)

[DJ Paul]
See I'm the king of the M slash C.E.O of Memphis
Riding hundred thousand dollar cars and feeling so damn pimpish
I'm the reason why you boys went back to your old style
I'mma hit you were it hurt cuz Dj Paul so damn wild
I know a bullshit nigga that should of been born dead
Fake as a superman movie I put some led in his head
Bogus as counterfit money my police nigga did hunta
Dropping dimes is his hobby now I want his ho I hit

[Juicy J]
I used to ride with the illest straight killa niggas D-boys
Rape his fellas but I seen the bigga picture
Like if ya on ya last bag sprinkle little bit of weed
In a blunt cuz a nigga had to stretch the figgas money
Don't grow on trees so we had to stack the cheese
Niggas out here phonie have ya spooked to slang the keys
Mane I'm like a diner thief asking niggas pass the piece
Cowards out here hating on me
Check the hook this ain't a please faggot

Chorus (4x)

[Crunchy Blac]
What's the buisness what's the buisness

Ain't no fucking with me ain't no fucking with us
And if ya fucking with us we put ya body in dust

[Frayser Boy]
I got my Glock in my hand I got my hand on my Glock
So if a nigga get wrong mane then a nigga get popped

So when you out in the public best hang around you a cop

Frayser Boy I unload on one of you bitches though
No understanding when you try to play me like a little ho fasho

Chorus (4x)



[Project Pat]
She's a freaky young gal, a bi-sexual
But a hustler though and will sell some snow
Wit dat' juicy fat thang I can't let you go
What she doing mane wit' all that I bet you know?
Baby girl takes dem trips down to Mexico
Get dem birds and dat herbs and will see her doe
Clock ticks like her brain when she sceme a plot
Set playas up for change and receive alot
My thang staying on hard make that coochie pop
Suck me up til she get the last goosy drop
The shake club never had much to offer her
A dyke broad get none cause it's boss wit her
And it's boss wit' me why you be asking when twerking
She don't claim pimp but she'll have ya' working
All it's certain she been there and did dat'
Could be corporate lawyer or a hood rat

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
She's a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
Catching me wit' the doe and she'll take the charge

[Project Pat]
Razor blade in ya mouth green stuff in ya' stuff
Philly blunts in ya' purse but that ain't enough
Turning liquor bottles up cha' mane as we dip
Turn right turn left each corner take a sip
Say wassup to the big pussy click in Hine Park
Learna and Leonara and those who got hard
Staying down wit your dogs till they let your dogs go
Jail house like a dog house dog y'ain't know
Everbody need somebody real on there team
No letters no visitation make you mean
Make you wanna think everybody left you for dead
And ya' gal dat' you love out there giving head
What the past don't be thinking bout the things that I did
I need money for some commisaries can ya' dig
Taking chances with us so we can live
Put some rims on my car shoes for the kids

[Chorus] - repeat



(Chorus)
I don't wanna go to county jail no more more more
Its a big fat policeman at my door door door
He'll snatch you by yo collar make you pay a dollar
I don't wanna go t county jail no more more more

(Project Pat)
Where is Project? Where is Project?
Here I go here I go
Suckas wanna take me suckas wanna break me
Yeah I know yeah I know
Here they come tha policia servin me a warrant
Blastin off my piece-ia that's how I responded
Eyes redp off this refia stangin like a hornet
Hood slang what I speak to ya thugs get up on it
Hoppin out like a frog ribbit ribbit ribbit ribbit
Horny toad dodgin laws let me feel it can I hit it
Freak ones wit tha curly tongues sturdy givin puns
Early birds came to put the worm right down they lungs
Gimme some little incident when them blues'll flash
Jump and grab on the atf then I mash tha gas
They just love mane to pull me ova cause I'm ghetto star
Any weapons any drugs sir searchin in my car

(Chorus x2)

(Project Pat)
Sugar me timba dog and blow me down
Pullin out tha tone tone and yall don't make a sound
Lay it down for tha mista twista bottle caps

Chitty chitty bang bang nuthin but cheese mane
Nitty gritty what I get to wit my thang thang
When you try to come around-a don't try to down tha

Po-pos they be watchin chickens are flockin
I'm game for some brain we call Doc and lockin
Tha green is inhaled-a drunk like a sailor
Did you see tha whale-a mane on her tail-a
Tha jail I was locked up hell what I went through
Went just like a chef cause I kept a Ginsu
Project doin time now that's just a no no
I don't wanna go to jail no a mo' mo'

(Chorus x2)

(Project Pat)
Ba-ba-buka chickens don't be kissin me
Like Alfred Hitchcock this really ain't no mystery
Tha game don't stizop to hell wit suckas dissin me
A burnt up  blizock will send you penitentiary
Get caught by tha narcs for slammin on tha con-a-crete
Charge partna talk for straight killin on tha street
You need to wa-watch tha company you keepin wit
Tha tones p--p-pop tha bullets goin for a snitch
A North Memphis veteran I ain't scared of nann
Keep my hand on tha metal friend and that's off tha wam
Understand where I'm comin from playas flexin
Crown Vics, trucks, Chevy, Max, and them Lexins
You can keep it on tha lowsky or get you some time
All these hatas gettin nosey you stay on tha grind
Like Aaliyah robadowsky knockin suckas out
Ain't no goin back to pokey what I'm talkin bout

(Chorus x2)

Don't let your mouth write a check that that ass can't cash
Don't let that finger pull the trigger and that ass get blast
Don't let them niggas pump your nuts and now you thinking you bad
Don't let me run up on yo ass and you end up in the past

[Verse 1: Frayser Boy]
I know this nigga and he always be talking that bullshit
But little do he know he gon suffer a wig split
Like fucking with the realest the illest will fucking kill him
A straight up headbuster and also a real nigga
There's gon be consequences so niggas just run in here
I'm unloading the tone and popping an extra clip
A bitch nigga talking is something I can't stand
Or every last will pick up the mess that's gonna land
The I.V.'s in his arm the bullets up in his chest
His shop about to close he shoulda had on a vest
Don't fuck with me nigga that's something I have to stress
Keep talking shit boy your gonna end up with one less
I'm out the Bay nigga that's something you gonna respect
And stay out of my business before you feel the Tech
Don't give a shit bout you I treat you like my hoe
Gon wake up one night and I'm kicking up in your door hoe

[Hook: Frayser Boy]
Don't let your mouth write a check that that ass can't cash
Don't let that finger pull the trigger and that ass get blast
Don't let them niggas pump your nuts and now you thinking you bad

Don't let your mouth write a check that that ass can't cash
Don't let that finger pull the trigger and that ass get blast
Don't let them niggas pump your nuts and now you thinking you bad
Don't let me run up on yo ass and you end up in the past

[Verse 2: Frayser Boy]
When I buck em, touch em, fuck em, now you clutching laying down
Got you ducking muthafucker, turn that smile to a frown
I will pop em, drop em, bullets launching, resting all up in your chest
I'm guessing letting bullets wet ya
Shoulda been drenched down in vest hoe that's fasho
I'm most definitely bringing pain to you niggas
Like some bitches when I step up in this thang
All you niggas do is gossip like some lil' hoes
You might as well go down to the Shake Junt and slide down poles
Now you running while I'm gunning
Stomping hoping to get close to some shelter
Better catch up with some polices, hope that they can help ya
Help to ? you just better get some younger quick and fast
I'm holding the match and your body's drenching down with gas
Got the tone to ya head yo life flashing right front your eyes
Blow yo ass off  ??????????
Me and Project Pat toting gats we do this for sport
Have you made lights, camera, action on the news report

[Hook: Frayser Boy]
Don't let your mouth write a check that that ass can't cash
Don't let that finger pull the trigger and that ass get blast
Don't let them niggas pump your nuts and now you thinking you bad
Don't let me run up on yo ass and you end up in the past
Don't let your mouth write a check that that ass can't cash
Don't let that finger pull the trigger and that ass get blast
Don't let them niggas pump your nuts and now you thinking you bad
Don't let me run up on yo ass and you end up in the past

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Now fuck this goddamn talking

You insane if ya think I'ma still let ya breathe
I got Anna on my chest with some tricks up my sleeve
I'ma blast on ya hoe give a damn who was looking
Blow the top off your skull then your life has been tooken
You was cooking up a scheme tryna put me in the beam
But the jokes on you jack slapped his ass with the gat
Beat 'em down to the pavement squealing like a pig
My nigga I don't save 'em beat em like a bitch
Ain't nobody tryna help ya, what they finna do
Hollow lead's gonna melt up, you and your crew
Superman stick your chest out
And watch this 38 slug blow your back out
Bout to bust on you boys shoot you till you dead
I love playing with them toys pocket full of lead

Right across yo lips, work your hips on the trackula
Fuck 'em til you sense-u-less, captin so ridiculous
Never hear, what you say, cause you speaking gibberish

You done got your walking papers, now its time for you to walk
Step on off and be a mom, dem yo kids I got none

Riding clean smelling good, dipping in ya neighborhood
Saw you at the mattabus, looking hard, wish ya could

Ain't buying shit for dem rats, ho dem ain't my kids

You drink some gasoline, I'm a bout to strike a match-a

If you boys got beef we can

In da club or da street we can
Go wit it

Blow for blow wit it
Crack his head wit a gun

(Project Pat)
In Hollywood at the stop sign
Watchin out for one time
Clean on them things
Niggas hate cause I'm bout mine
I'm on that weed
So the car's kinda smokey
The Glock's in the stash
Cause I'm dodgin the pokey
Its hard on tha street
Niggas livin like a catfish
A project killa, four kids
And a fat bitch
Try to flip e'ry quarter ounce
Ain't no credit barred
We accept cash, merchandise
Or ya ebit(EBT) card
Like to start shit
At the club we be flexin
And we'll kill a bitch
At these hoes we be beckin
North North to the full
My game they respectin
A rope to the bumper
You get drug by yo neck-in
Don't come around here
You'z betta reckin
You get ya ass blowed off
For playin and jeckin
Down in this dirty
Only real muhfuckas rule
Hoes wearin flirty skirties
Young niggas act a fool

(Chorus x2)

(La Chat)
If there's some ana to handle
I'm gonna take care of my biz
I got a scope on ya body
I'm aimin straight for yo wig
I love to show out on hoes
I love to cut up wit niggas
These bitches always get wrong
So I love pullin tha trigga
And since you hoes won't learn
I got some lessons to teach
You betta call up the pastor
He got a sermon to preach
I ain't wit that arguin and cussin and fussin
Bitchin and fightin
I'm buckin choppas off top
Committed to takin yo life'n
La Chat a mac slash killa
Only speakin the real-a
I'm tryna let you know its on
For you violate a nigga
A bitch be quick to talk shit
But do you mean what you say
A real killa don't be talkin
They just be on they way
I don't think you wanna get down
You boys ain't ready for beef
There ain't nowhere you can hide
I called out an APD
This ain't game that ya playin
These bitches comin up slayin
I keep my ears to tha street
So hoe you watch what ya sayin

(Chorus x2)

(Project Pat)
They lock me up just like 2Pac
And I went platinum
Layed it down for a calendar
Now right back at em
Took my game weighed it up
On a triple beam
Niggas rob, kill, murder, steal
For that ghetty green
U.S. Marshal at my folks house
Wanna kill me dead
Wanna see me in a pine box
Bullet in my head
Police mane I ain't did shit
Why you hatin this
Ghetto thugs love my rap songs
They relate to this
Swingin fists Knock ya eyeball
Clean out ya face
Shoulda known it was shit starters
All in tha place
Young niggas on that powder
Gon off tha bay
Sneakin tones in da club
You could get blown away
Its a muhfuckin clique thang
Represent ya hood
Slangin cane makin plenty change
All to the good
Smokin blunt after blunt
Pound after pound
Throw a dead body in tha trunk
High weave ya down

(Chorus)

Fuckin' wit T-R-I-P-L, E-S-I-X
Niggaz be talkin' but in the end I like fuck 'em up
In the beginnin' they could've survived but they had no nuts
Bitch where you graduated from, I said a school of hoe-in'
'Cause in yo face, off in the streets aint nothin' but hoe is showin'
Too fuckin' light, too fuckin' light to try to fight
Stick you with knives, shoot you with - nines and take yo life

Yea we know you niggaz are fuckin' scared 'cause we don't play around
Never wanna step 'cause Three 6 Mafia put you in the ground
People say you buck but we all know that's just that liquor bro
Niggaz swear you hype but all that hyper is from hittin' that snow
If a member call me then I'm gonna pack my yawks and roll
Ride down on yo block and close up shop and leave yo body cold
Foo this ain't no game so tuck ya chain and coward hide yo grill
High cappin' and dissin' in yo rappin' just might get ya killed

They don't fuck wit you like ya fucked with them
Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb
You got no ends, now you got no friends
Now its time to get the strap and go and do they ass in

They don't fuck wit you like ya fucked with them
Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb
You got no ends, now you got no friends
Now its time to get the strap and go and do they ass in

Whachu doin' round hea? My nigga I gotta get ya
Fresh outta jail-ie, my mind on bailin', so I split ya
Head to the meet-ie, give to the needy so fuck the rest
No understandin', Projects the greedy, ya could be next
I'm robbin' victims with of the face of a?
No hesitatin', I come out buckin' so watch the nine
Off in East Memphis transactin' bizness I know you straight
I'm buckin' you fakers who ain't got cheese, the ones I hate

Could it be me, could it be somethin' in the fuckin' air
Im seein' niggaz, them niggaz bodies flyin' everywhere
You wanna know if the Lord is mackin' or a fuckin' player
I'm keepin' all of you muthafuckas in my fuckin' prayers
Everywhere that I go I'm gettin' all these evil stares
I'm sick of all of these hatin' muthafuckas in my hair
All in my bizness, God is my witness I don't even care
Cause all you bitches you get the *blaah* died hell yeah

They don't fuck wit you like ya fucked with them
Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb
You got no ends, now you got no friends
Now its time to get the strap and go and do they ass in

They don't fuck wit you like ya fucked with them
Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb
You got no ends, now you got no friends
Now its time to get the strap and go and do they ass in

Deep deep in them trenches of Memphis where I'm seriously pimpin'
Da Koopsta da Knicca breakin' mo bitches than London got bridges

Touch me and you'll die see you can burn wit me in hell

Witness this wicked bit whipped up outta the Six riders

My nigga CB he be back out here on these bricks again
He kickin' in doors, he lookin' for him some dividends
He kidnappin' hoes so he can make him some money mane
And fuckin' wit him is like fuckin' wit somethin' different
Ya gotta be tough, nigga ya gotta be rough

In gats we trust nigga, it really ain't much nigga
'Cause talkin' to us nigga, we blowin' ya up

Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb
You got no ends, now you got no friends

[Verse 1 - Project Pat]
Hypnotize camp got a answer for you hoes
Inhale the weed blow the smoke out your nose
Crack open bottles of that liquor, pour it in
Gonna take a swallow of that vodka and gin
Hoes making cheese off of tricks who'll spend
Up all they money, ho you gotta check em in
Game recognize, eyes lit like a match
Blaze up this fire, paranoid like on crack
Riding with my dogs, dodging laws when we roll
Through the Dixie Homes me and Toby on a stroll
See a short skirt and we looking for a ho
One that'll suck dick, one that'll go
Coward ass niggas get wrong and we blast
Never knowing who always wear a mask
Talking that smack, then reach in the stash
Dumping them slugs then mash on the gas
[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Crunchy Black]
All I do is smoke on bud
Break the Swisher down, nigga, fill it up with drugsRiding through your neighborhood with my cuz
Looking for us a freaky little slut
Found us a slut, so we pick the bitch up
Smoking on that 'dro, nigga, pouring in her cup
This bitch right here know she gotta fuck
Fucked me, mane, and she sucking on my cuz
Fill her up with X, mane, we don't give a fuck
Get this little freaky bitch for some drugs

[Hook]

We chain-smokers taking drags, no slack up
Then take shots of that liquor intox-o-
Cated mane, hand on trigga, let it blow

You look around and you could be victim

He thinking Project was cool, you damn fool
Mane I got Memphis in my blood, I cross too

I'm a sleepy head cause I'm a weed head
I'm a hammer head when her knees spread
Walking like I'm talking till my teeth bled
Till my feet red I'mma need meds
I'mma need mines I'mma need theirs
I'm a blind head I'm a bleach head
She a xan head she a beach head

Tunechi, I am the Sensei
Money Money Money Money team hit the funny team with the trick play
Touch down celebration
Wait, go crazy

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Slob on my knob like corn on the cob
Check in with me, and do your job
Lay on the bed, and give me head
Don't have to ask, don't have to beg
Juicy is my name, sex is my game
Let's call the boys, let's run a train
Squeeze on my nuts, lick on my butt
The natural curly hair, please, don't touch
First find a mate, second find a place
Third find a bag, to hide the ho face
Real name Rover, I said bend over
I started to knock, then came the odor
Smelled like mush, should've had a woosh
Told her to stop and take a douche
While she did that, I didn't want the cat
So I bounced out and never came back

[Hook: Juicy J]
Suck a nigga dick or something
Suck a nigga dick or something
Suck a nigga dick or something
Suck a nigga dick or something

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
My nigga D-Magic said he had to have it
I said, "Just forget it, it's too crabby"
Know a little freak, in Hollywood
Sucks on dick, does it real good?
She'll give you money, fill up your tummy
House full of kids, parents all schummy
Once had a down, backyard ground
Hit it from the back, enjoy the sound
Lay on the cover, always use the rubber
Till I got caught, fucking with her mother
She blamed it on me, we fought in the street
She pulled out a knife, so I had to flee
Called up the boys, went to her house
Charged the whole place, threw the bitch out
Police busted in, where the niggas at
We left just in time, and never came back
Roll through the hood, waving at the freaks
Who's sniffing all the rocks, and smoking all the geeks?
Made another stop, police station
Saw a few cops, drove by and sprayed them
License tag number, a nigga said he saw...
Bogus all the time, never get caught



[Music Video Intro: Juicy J]
Ride with the gang, ride with them things
Put a nigga thoughts outside of his brain
Got a bomb on the gas, Garrison Lane
For these kinda bags, you gon' need a crane
I remember comin' up from Memphis in the trenches
Northside, hoppin' fences to ride Benzes

[Chorus]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Verse 1]
Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'mma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo hoe if yo bitch keep eyein' me

[Chorus]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Post-Chorus]
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'

[Verse 2]
I'ma explain why you probably never seen me
I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D

[Chorus]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Post-Chorus]
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high (high, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust (all we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I'm alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Verse 5: Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
How you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up
(All I want is, all I want is)

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Outro: Rihanna]
It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby



[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I know 'round the world I be gettin' to the money

It's a dirty world and my cup too, it's so muddy
Long story short, I be gettin' to the money
My lady talkin' crazy, I done listened to the money
She crazy bout this dick and I'm addicted to the money
I gotta watch that bitch, she must be in it for the money
Long story short, I'mma pimp before a dummy

I ain't got high expectations I'm just expecting my money
If I don't get my check, I'm gonna be chin-checkin' for nothin'
If I don't get my check, I'm gonna be chin-checkin' in public
Long story short, I'm just gettin' to the money
Long story short, I'mma keep it short and sweet
I get to the money, I don't let it get to me
All my niggas ballin', it's the way this shit should be
I pull up on my darlin' and I lay the dick and leave
She'll thank you for comin'
I'll put that dick in her stomach
You put that cash on the dresser for her
You take the bitch out to restaurants
You took the bitch out the reservoir
And took the bitch straight to the fuckin' mall
I get higher than cholesterol
I see money in my crystal ball

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I see money in my crystal ball
Only answer when my niggas call
Hello, what up nigga
Ringtone 2Pac, Soulja Slim, or Biggie Smalls

Got steph walkin' round in the house

But niggas got their hands out and I don't read no palms

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know these niggas is pussy

I know these bitches got bad intentions
But I just want my money

Started from the bottom, nigga

[Bridge: Stephanie Acevedo]
Tryna break me off, you better break me off some money
Talkin' bout you love me? Better show me with the money
Show up at my door? Better show up with the money
Take me somewhere nice? It better be private and sunny
I got what you want, you got what I need
I just take the check and let you take the lead
I might take some shots, I might hit the weed
Put a dollar sign at the beginning of Stephanie
Mula

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I see money in my crystal ball
I'm bout to bust open this crystal ball
What up nigga?
Ringtone 2Pac, Soulja Slim, or Biggie Smalls
Countin' money, listenin' to 2Pac, Soulja Slim, or Biggie Smalls

And I'm a dog and I'm in my drawers

But niggas got their hands out and I don't read no palms

[Verse  3: Stephanie Acevedo]
Spendin' spaniel, wasted cause my nigga hustle for me

So close with all my brothers and so far away from ugly
Racin' in my new car, I see new friends actin' funny
Spendin' spaniel, wasted cause my nigga hustle for me

All these niggas round me are my brothers, are my brothers
They'll kill anybody if they fuck with me, I love 'em
They'll kill anybody if they fuck with me, I love 'em

Oops, I guess I'll shot ya

Click-click

[Verse 2: Madonna]
I'm a sex pistol
My love should be illegal
Real deal, baby
I'm no counterfeit
Click-click

[Bridge: Madonna]
Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
E-o-e-o
My body's fully loaded
And I've got more ammo

Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
If looks could kill
E-o-e-o
You're an accessory to murder, 'coz

[Chorus 1: Madonna]
My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy?
I let it bang bang

[Verse 3: Madonna]
You've been hit by a smooth criminal
A bad girl, I gotcha crying to your mumma
Saying "I can't believe it" (I can't believe it)
I've seen your type, bring a knife into a gun fight
Caught up in the law right
I think I'm in love and I

[Bridge: Madonna]
[Chorus 1: Madonna ]

[Post-Chorus: Madonna ]
I let it bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I line 'em up and watch them fall

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Bang
Tha shooting name is Wayne
The victim didn't complain, she just screamed "shoot again"
I gave her extra rounds, my barrel twist around
I am Mr. shoot 'em down, I leave hearts on tha ground
My love: using weapon, and yes I use it well
Then I let the rose petals cover up the bullet shells
I never shoot and tell, I only shoot to kill
And the vest ain't gonna help it even if you're laying still

[Chorus: Madonna (x2)]
[Post-Chorus: Madonna & Lil Wayne]

Do you wanna die happy?

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, hoe, pull your panties up
Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

[Hook: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
Till I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Hook: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

While I got more cards than a psychic, I'm good
Black credit card, nigga swipe it, I'm good

[Intro: JAY-Z]
(Ha-ya) My nigga got on
(Ha-ya) My nigga got on all white, no socks
(Ha-ya, ha-ya)
My nigga got that cocaina on today
That's how he feel, turn my vocal up (Ha-ya)
That's how you feel, Emory? (Ha-ya)
Turn my vocal up some more
Turn my vocal up, Guru! (Ha-ya)
Turn the music up too (Ha-ya-ya-ya)

[Verse 1: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Super Bowl goals
My wife in the crib feedin' the kids liquid gold
We in a whole different mode
Kid that used to pitch bricks can't be pigeonholed
I cooked up more chicken when the kitchen closed
Uh, we gon' reach a billi' first
I told my wife the spiritual shit really work
Alhamdulillah, I run through 'em all
Hovi's home, all these phonies come to a halt
All this old talk left me confused
You'd rather be old rich me or new you?
And old niggas, y'all stop actin' brand new
Like 2Pac ain't have a nose ring too, huh
Nobody wins when the family feuds
But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit
I'm clear why I'm here, how about you?
Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute
(Mmmmm) Pretty much
If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us
Fuck rap, crack cocaine
Nah, we did that, Black-owned things
Hundred percent, Black-owned champagne
And we merrily merrily eatin' off these streams
Y'all still drinkin' Perrier-Jouët, hah
But we ain't get through to you yet, uh
What's better than one billionaire? Two (two)
'Specially if they're from the same hue as you
Y'all stop me when I stop tellin' the truth

[Interlude: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Hahahaha (Ha-ya)
I would say I'm the realest nigga rappin' (Ha-ya)
But that ain't even a statement (Ha-ya)
That's like sayin' I'm the tallest midget (Ha-ya)
Wait, that ain't politically correct , forget it (Ha-ya)
Can I get "Amen" from the congregation?
Amen, amen (Ha-ya)
Can I get a "Amen" from the congregation?
Amen, amen (Ha-ya)
Ha-ya-ya-ya

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Yeah, I'll fuck up a good thing if you let me
Let me alone, Becky
A man that don't take care his family can't be rich
I'll watch Godfather, I miss that whole shit
My consciousness was Michael's common sense
I missed the karma that came as a consequence
Niggas bustin' off through the curtains 'cause she hurtin'
Kay losin' the babies 'cause their future's uncertain
Nobody wins when the family feuds
We all screwed 'cause we never had the tools
I'm tryna fix you
I'm tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official
Y'all think small, I think Biggie
Y'all whole pass is in danger, ten Mississippi
Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies
How is him or Pill Cosby s'posed to help me?
Old niggas never accepted me
New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin' Dos Equis
We all lose when the family feuds
What's better than one billionaire? Two

[Interlude: JAY-Z]
Hahahah
I'll be damned if I drink some Belvedere while Puff got CÎROC
Y'all need to stop

[Outro: Beyoncé]
(Ha-ya) Ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya
(Ha-ya) Ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya
(Ha-ya) Ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya
Ha-ya-ya-ya
Ha-ya, ha-ya
Love me like, love
Yeah yeah yeah
Like.... yeah, yeah, yeah
Like.... yeah, yeah, yeah
Like.... yeah, yeah, yeah
Like.... yeah, yeah, yeah
Like.... yeah, yeah, yeah
Like.... yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'm a do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyeing me all hard
And lying to they girls and driving the same cars
Sitting there wishing they problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothing in common since I done became star
I done became bigger swerving writing in my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
‘Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doing them shows
Getting everyone nervous, ‘cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm going off, like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out I hope we can agree on
Making enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'm a do is free Weezy, go

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm going to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fighting the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheese head, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the red sea parted
My gun go crazy, like it's retarded
Red light on it, like it's recording
I ain't recording, I'm just C-4ing
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm going get money, money I'm gon' get
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, "Fuck the world with a long dick!"
Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! Then you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, head butt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shuffling the cards, 'bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches, like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger just screaming, motherfucker, do you hear her?
Drizzy Drake what the lick read
We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried

[Intro]
Yo, bro, I think I had too much Hennessy, man
This Hennessy gettin' to me
I ain't gonna lie, I'm a little smizz
I'm a little drizz
But we in the club, man, OOOUUU

[Verse]
Yeah, they hate, but they broke though
And when it's time to pop they a no-show
Yeah, I'm pretty, but I'm loco
The loud got me movin' slow-mo
Ayo, Tweetie, where the hoes, bro?
Ayo, Keys, where the hoes though?
That other nigga, he a bozo
It's M.A, you don't know, ho?
We got liquor by the boatload (that Henny)
Disrespect the Lyfe, that's a no-no
All my niggas dressed in that rojo (Redlyfe)
I ride for my guys, that's the bro code
Baby gave me head; that's a low blow
Damn, she make me weak when she deep throat
I need a rich bitch, not a cheap ho
They be on that hate shit, I peep though
My brother told me: "Fuck 'em, get that money, sis!"
You just keep on grindin' on your hungry shit
Ignore the hate, ignore the fake, ignore the funny shit
‘Cause if a nigga violate, we got a hunnit clips (grrrrrrrah!)
And we go zero to a hundred quick (ooouuu)
We just them niggas you ain't fuckin' with (oh no)
Pockets on a chubby chick (ah)
And still go bag a thottie in some bummy shit (ooouuu)
Yerr, Eli, why they testin' me?
Like I don't always keep the hammer next to me
Like I ain't got a hitter to the left of me
Like we ain't in these streets more than Sesame
If that's your chick, then why she textin' me?
Why she keep calling my phone speaking sexually?
Every time I'm out, why she stressin' me?
You call her Stephanie? I call her Headphanie (OOOUUU)
I don't open doors for a whore
I just want the neck, nothin' more
Shawty, make it clap, make it applaud!
When you tired of your man, give me a call
Dyke bitches talking out they jaw
Next minute, calling for the law
This 9 will have 'em calling for the Lord
They ain't getting shmoney, so they bored
I could never lose, what you thought?
M.A got it on lock, man, of course
They say I got the juice, I got the sauce
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
Pussy, I'm a bully and a boss
I'm killing 'em, sorry for your loss (R.I.P.)
I just caught a body; Randy Moss
Now this year I'm really going off

[Outro]
OOOUUU, OOOUUU
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
OOOUUU, OOOUUU
Ah, these haters on my body, shake 'em off
OOOUUU, OOOUUU
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
I could never lose, what you thought?
What they thought?
I could never lose, what you thought?
This Henny got me, it got me sauced
This Henny got me, oh, it got me sauced
I could never lose, what you thought?
M.A got it on lock, man, of course
OOOUUU, OOOUUU

Export, import checks on deck
Once the DJ drop this shit

Smoking on the top floor, I'm as high as I can get
Lean in the baby bottle, I try not to babysit
So I had to take a sip, if I like it then I buy
Got so many damn rides I put my garage on a diet

[Hook]
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic

[Verse 1]
On my way to Aspen, I forgot to do my taxes
Call up my accountant, he gon' make it do magic
Had to get a driver just to drop me at the airport
Way I smoked the blunts man I burned 'em up like Newport
Fifty thousand dollars on superstar attire
K.E. and Young Future bringing them fire
All this damn cash make a bitch wanna retire
Gotta drop a half a brick if you wanna put me on a flyer
Excuse me but my lingo crazy
See these diamonds ain't none of 'em fugazi
Two bad bitches wanna fuck me to Grady's
A young G in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot I'mma do a 180
For the haters I'mma go ahead and do it 360
Drinking on a Sprite got lean all in it
I'm a Astronaut nigga better trust my pimping

[Hook]
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic

[Verse 2]
Billionaire boy that's true inspiration
Learned the Astronaut Kid, no such thing as limitation
Flying down 20 in the motherfucking spaceship
Just left Magic in the motherucking basement
Two bitches trailing in a Beemer out of Germany
Gotta thing for me, they wanna sing for me
They like my energy, I'm an embassy
I know tricks like Criss Angel
I don't trick but I could make you famous
You could disappear from your past life
You will re-appear and go outta sight
I'm Pluto talkin', Jimmy walking when you walking
I used to be fly but now I'm hawking
I was an Earthling now im SciFi
Wallah, I stay high
My bitches on they high horse
I double back like two cups
And crawl out in that new Porsche



[Produced by Mike WiLL Made It & Zaytoven]

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]

Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton
Lil Kodak, bitch, I'm Polo'd down like Carlton

Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper

She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father

[Hook]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much too hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change

[Hook]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 2]
I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her, "Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout"
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners
I’m thinking about it right now
I’m holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air

[Hook]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Outro]
Thought it was a drought, thought it, thought it was a drought
We thought it was a drought, we poured an Actavis
Bitch, I'mma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you

I'd rather be realer than you

[Intro]
Ain't this what they've been waitin' for?
You ready? Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
In a matter of time I spent on some locked-up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game, and I said: "Yeah, I do."
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said 'achoo'
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lion-hearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm a artist
No crawlin', went straight to walkin' with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches ménagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me "Get 'em!", I got 'em
I did it without a album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga, I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari – hater, rest in peace
Hater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga!

[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait a minute! Y'all thought I was finished?
When I bought that Aston Martin, y'all thought it was rented?
Flexin' on these niggas: I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant
I’m the type to count a million cash, then grind like I’m broke
That Lambo my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
‘Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
‘Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
‘Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
All I know is murder, when it come to me
I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's
Every time I'm in that bitch I get to throwin' 30 G's
But now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins
They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin'
We young niggas, we mobbin', like Batman and we're robbin'
This two-door Maybach with my seat all reclinin'
I'm like real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?
If you ain't about that murder game then, pussy nigga, shut up!
If you diss me in your raps I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood; no, that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA, at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet, like that little engine I could
Boy, I slide down on your block, bike on twelve o'clock
And they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch
And I'm the king of my city ‘cause I'm still callin' them shots
And these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say, "remember me!"
So much money, have yo friends turn in yo enemies
And when there’s beef I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go for 40, ain't no 10 a key
Hold up! Broke nigga turned rich, love the game like Mitch
And if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was somethin' about that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone



[Intro]
Turn the music down in my headphones, yeah
That noise in the background, that's my skateboard
That nigga Mack crazy
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
I put my shooters on they feet
I just give 'em your address, then go to sleep
The money turned my niggas into monsters
The white done turned my niggas into Nazis, Lord
The money turned my face into a stocking
Don't make me turn your baby to a hostage, boy
Don't make me turn the kid to a foster
My woman turn my dick into a Mazda, Lord
Body parts in the duffel
The bullets turn your body to a puzzle
The money turn my bitch into a monster
She know how to get a check and turn a zero to a comma, Lord
The money turn my niggas into killas
The sugar turnt the cocaine to vanilla
The money turnt the bitches into hoes
The money turned my niggas into foes, Lord
I put my shooters on they feet
Give 'em your address, then I go out to eat
Had that snowman in the hood like Jody Breeze
She from the hood but look like she from overseas
I said, "Girl you know I love you and I care for ya
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya"
She say, "Fuck these other niggas, they ain't half of ya
Just keep laughing to the bank, it's hilarious"
I got a stay-at-home gun and a travel gun
Boy, we could sell white, in Africa
It's like, I can't explain, y'all asked me to spit
And now I'm drooling on my chain
What happened to Wayne?

[Verse 2]
I'm like, hold up, wait a second
Y'all thought I was second?
Hating on a champ
Throwing salt and not confetti
We pull up and we shoot
Then we park the car and edit
Watch me pull up with no roof
That's cause I walk the dog and pet it
I'm like, hold up, wait a minute
Y'all thought I was finished?
Shoot you in your head
Then just walk off like I didn't
Let my money talk so much
Put my jawbone outta business
Doing numbers in this bitch
I'm like a smart phone with the digits
Bitch

[Verse 3]
Riding 'round with the volume down
With the windows up and the choppers down
Soon as we get to your block
It's the motherfuckin' other way around
My bitch say I'm too wild
She don't even know why she stay around
I get  home and I dick her down
Now she talkin' bout exchanging vows
If these bullets was paintballs
I could fuck around and I could paint a house
You could tell I'm pimpin'
The way I hit the blunt with my pinkie out
I bring wine to Amy house
We smoke it out and we drank it out
And talk about these pussy niggas
That ain't about what Wayne about
I'm hangin out a Mulsanne without a brain, it's out of its mind
I pull over, I push a button, it change like Optimus Prime
Speaking of change, it's a shame how these lames droppin' them dimes
We aim at your grape, knock it off, now you just vines
Blood Gang, red rain on these niggas, hot if you dry
My gang top of the line, hollerin' out "Squad, take it outside"
I'm a tax payer, I'm a axe player, gettin' in through the back well
Red devil to the blue collared, un-enveloped black mail
Fed up with the fed shit and Fed-Ex lost my package
My white girls say "Yeah, nigga," my white homies act blackish
Ain't tall enough for the NBA, I ain't big enough for the NFL
Should've  been in N.W.A., fuck the police, Five-0 and 12
One time for your mind, bitch, never say nevermind, bitch
You a penny short of a dime, bitch, no nonsense, had a nine since
I was nine, bitch
Yeah, born to murder
Bank account on fat, bustin' out the girdle
Tell 'em boys ain't nothin' sweet, it's sauerkraut, ya heard me?
They find ya body in New Orleans on Mardi Gras on Bourbon
Like, oh, Lord, Humphrey Bogart
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a crowbar
For the most part, I'm the southern coast guard
AK-47 spittin' flame like a blow torch

[Outro]
Sorry 4 The Wait, woo



[Intro]
I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action
You want action, you get turned into past tense
Your boys deep? Well, let's get to subtractin'
Smith & Wesson made my 9 with some compassion

[Chorus]
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (skrt, skrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (skrrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (skrt, skrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (skrrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face

[Verse 1]
Pimp gon' be eatin' good noodles every day
Bitch I'm drawin' doodles, Tay-K paint the way
Choppa tear your dudies into fish fillet
I woke up too moody, who gon' die today?
Shoot a fuckboy in his motherfuckin' face
We cookin' up, boy, you don't wanna go dat way
Gotta go dat way, you get robbed for your rackades
Gotta go dat way, boy you not gon' be happy
I tote 50s, I'm a shooter like Young Pappy
Bitch try to rob, we make her dance, Michael Jackson
We was plottin', y'all was tryna get the pack in
Get the pack in, you get robbed for a fraction
I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action
You want action, you get turned into past tense
Your boys teeth? Well, let's get to subtractin'
Smith & Wesson made my 9 with sub-compaction

[Chorus]
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race
I'm gon' shoot bitch, without a debate
I'm gon' shoot, you can see it in my face
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case (grra, grra)
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (skrt, skrt)

[Outro]
See it in my mothafuckin' face



[Intro: Faith Evans & Bryson Tiller]
Oh, my inspiration comes from you, oh
So you think you got what it takes
To be my ride or die?
Okay
We shall see

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I been out here soul searchin'
Ayy, say you still got it, girl, what makes you so certain?
Hit it, quit it, then went cold turkey
You been committed through this whole journey
Got a girl that don't expect as much from me
That's why she gets so much love from me
She just might be the one for me
Ain't no need to question, down bitch

[Chorus]
She 'a pull the gun for me
Pop 2, she 'a take one for me
Set it off, if a bitch come for me
Set if off, if a nigga come for me
She 'a pull the gun for me
Pop 2, she 'a take one for me
Set it off, if a bitch come for me
Set it off, if a nigga come

[Verse 2]
Do you remember them days, I would cut school and come to you
Ma' was cool so I got comfortable
Sleeping on the couch, sneak up to your room, ayy
I found out you was a freak too soon, ayy
Your family thought we had baby too soon, phh
I told your family not to speak too soon, ayy
Three years later, I'm on TV
Now your brother, he envy me
I don't know what the fuck he be on, ayy
Cool with me cool, we was never friends
He put your mama under stress, I put her in a Benz
Even though she put me in the streets, she made amends
Watchin' over my babies nigga
'Case her son wanna go back to his ways and be a street nigga
Plus my girl just copped the heat, nigga
And she gon' kill almost any nigga
Including me, nigga
Ain't nobody who could be with her, 'cept for me
That's my down bitch

[Chorus]
She 'a pull the gun for me
Pop two, she 'a take one for me
Set it off, if a bitch come for me
Set it off, if a nigga come for me
She 'a pull the gun for me
Pop two, she 'a take one for me
Set it off, if a bitch come for me
Set it off, if a nigga come for me

[Outro: Bryson Tiller & Unknown]
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ayy, think she'll fuck with this song?
Yeah, I hope so nigga
She ain't call me back for some reason
Oh well, I love her



[Intro: 2Pac]
Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body
That blows like a 12-gauge shotty, feel me!
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

[Hook: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me
And my diamonds, when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

[Hook: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart; now hail Mary, nigga!

[Hook: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

[Verse 3: Kastro]
They got a APB out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

[Verse 4: Young Noble]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that mothafucka, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, 60 seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice gat, but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond; when I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up

[Bridge: Kadafi]
If it's on, then it's on, we rape break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

[Hook: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

[During Hook: Prince Ital Joe]
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, hail Mary!

[Outro: 2Pac]
Westside, Outlawz
Makaveli the Don, solo
Killuminati, The 7 Days



[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Bridge]
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay



[Verse 1]
Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not
Ready for you
Every part
Of my aching heart
Needs you more
Than the angels do

[Chorus]
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?

[Verse 2]
If you could
I know that you'd stay
We both know
Things don't work that way
I promised I
Wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin
And my voice gets thin

[Chorus]
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?

[Bridge]
Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't
See you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar

[Chorus]
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?



[Verse 1]
Love, I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah
(Fuck!)

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined

[Verse 2]
Love, is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against you
And you just stay lined up, yeah
(Fuck!)

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces (bitch)
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (bitch)

[Bridge]
My rose garden dreams, set on fire by fiends
And all my black beaches are ruined
My celluloid scenes are torn at the seams
And I fall to pieces (bitch)
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
(Why?)

[Outro]
'Cause I love you so much, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (bitch)
Are ruined (bitch), are ruined (fuck!)



[Verse 1]
Finally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For... and for... (shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)

[Verse 2]
Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's no more chasin' rainbows
And hopin' for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (touch, touch)
There's nothin' to hold on to (hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (ah, ah, ah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)



[Verse 1]
Up all night on my mind got me thinking
Wanna stay, can you give me a reason?
I don't think so, I don't think so
I'm in love with someone, but I'm not sure
She can love someone back the way they love her
I don't think so, I don't think so

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't be mean, if you wanna go
You can leave and leave my heart alone

[Chorus]
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

[Verse 2]
Give it time, c'mon babe, it's been ten months
You should know, do you know, know what you want?
I don't think so, I don't think so
Make it work, know it hurts, but I'll go there
Do the same, can you show me that you care?
God, I hope so, but I don't think so

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't be mean, if you're here for good
I'm gonna need a little more from you

[Chorus]
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you
But my heart is so invested, I don't wanna face the truth
I'm not happy, and you know it, and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you
But my heart is so invested, I don't wanna face the truth
I'm not happy, and you know it, and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it



[Verse 1]
It could change, but this feels like, like the calm before the storm
Not that I don't wanna try, but I've been here before
Friends in town, phone's at home, I tell myself it's fine
Can't remember how you taste, slept alone too many nights

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?

[Verse 2]
Half my clothes are at your house, and I don't want them back
The smell of you is way too much, not gonna put my heart through that
I don't know how much time we got, I don't know how much to say
I don't know, tell me what you want, I want you to want me to stay

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?

[Bridge]
La la la la la la la
La la la la oh yeah
La la la la la la la
Ooh ooh ooh

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?



[Verse 1]
All I know is (ooh ooh ooh)
We could go anywhere, we could do
Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in
All I know is (ooh ooh ooh)
Getting lost late at night, under stars
Finding love standing right where we are, your lips

They pull me in the moment
You and I alone and
People may be watching, I don't mind ‘cause

[Chorus]
Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town
Or bottles that we can't pronounce
'Cause anywhere, babe
Is like Paris in the rain
When I’m with you
When I’m with you
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain

[Verse 2]
I look at you now and I want this forever
I might not deserve it but there's nothing better
Don't know how I ever did it all without you
My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest
Feelings they come and they go, that they do
Feelings they come and they go, not with you

The late nights
And the street lights
And the people
Look at me girl
And the whole world could stop

[Chorus]
Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town
Or bottles that we can't pronounce
'Cause anywhere, babe
Is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain

[Bridge]
Oh
Girl, when I'm not with you
All I do is miss you
So come and set the mood right
Underneath the moonlight
(Days in Paris
Nights in Paris)
Paint you with my eyes closed
Wonder where the time goes
(Yeah, isn't it obvious
Isn't it obvious)
Come and set the mood right
Underneath the moonlight

[Outro]
'Cause anywhere with you feel right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
Walking down an empty street
Puddles underneath our feet



[Verse 1]
Running from the morning
Think I hit a wall
Late nights, not you
Running from the moment
So I don’t recall
Late nights, not you
Waking up in a cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
I’d do anything to not be alone
All alone with the ceiling
All alone with this feeling
And I wonder if I’ll ever let go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried spending my nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

[Verse 2]
Drowning in my coffee
To wash the alcohol
Out my bloodstream
Sitting here I wonder
If we hadn’t been at all
Who would I be
Waking up in a cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
And I wonder if I’ll ever let go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried spending
My nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried spending
My nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

[Chorus]
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you



[Verse 1: Rita Ora]
In your eyes, I'm alive
Inside you're beautiful
Something so unusual in your eyes
I know I'm home (yeah)
Every tear, every fear
Gone with the thought of you
Changing what I thought I knew
I'll be yours for a thousand lives

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
I'm free as a bird when I'm flying in your cage
I'm diving in deep and I'm riding with no brakes
And I'm bleeding in love, you're swimming in my veins
You've got me now

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't lookin' for love till I found you (oh na-na, yea)
For love, 'til I found you (oh)

[Verse 2: Liam Payne]
Skin to skin
Breathe me in
Feel with your kiss on me
Lips are made of ecstasy
I'll be yours for a thousand lives (for a thousand lives)

[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne & Rita Ora]
I'm free as a bird when I'm flying in your cage (so lost)
I'm diving in deep and I'm riding with no brakes (no no)
And I'm bleeding in love, you're swimming in my veins
You've got me now (now now)

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't lookin' for love 'til I found you (oh na-na, yea)
For love, 'til I found you (oh)
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't lookin' for love till I found you (oh na-na, yea)
For love, 'til I found you (oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
I'm free as a bird when I'm flying in your cage
I'm diving in deep and I'm riding with no brakes
And I'm bleeding in love, you're swimming in my veins
You've got me now

[Chorus: Liam Payne & Rita Ora & Both]
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you (Ooh na-na, yea)
For love, 'til I found you (oh)
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya (oh yeah)
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you
(Ooh na-na, yea)
For love, 'til I found you (oh)

[Outro: Liam Payne & Rita Ora]
Wasn't lookin' for love 'til I found you (Ooh na-na, yea)
For love 'til I found you (oh)



[Verse]
Shoutout my label that's me
I'm in this bitch with TP
I'm in this bitch with 4trey
I just poured up me a 8
Real nigga all in my face
500 racks in my safe
500 racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love
What you know 'bout pullin' up, in Bentley trucks
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no hoe
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together we came from the bottom we used to wear each other clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain’t my niggas no mo'
Hold it down for the 4
In the 9 with the woes
Marlo my dawg that's for sho'
We won't fall out about shit
Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain’t gone fallout bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads
We let 'em go for the low
I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both my ears on froze
I been gettin faded I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties I pay for 'em
Get outta there when I wake up
I pass the ball I don't layup
I'm a big boss I got say so
They’ll wipe you down If I say so
Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos
40's, on 40's, on 40's
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina shout out New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz Truck
Hop out fresher than a mento
Lil nigga but I'm big dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Hit a nigga block, two calls
Cross a nigga up, hot sauce
Ooh I got 'em mad, my fault
Talking bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these percs I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangsta but they won't approach me
I know they'll never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the game to the fullest
I run with some real ones I don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer don't push me
I see how you niggas be lookin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a vert with a uzi
Twelve get behind me I lose 'em
They tryin' guess what I'm doin'
They tryin' guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits
Yeah



[Intro: Moneybagg Yo]
Ugh ugh ugh
Fed shit
Ayy, gangster shit only nigga
Lil Baby what's poppin'?
DMac got me too bangin'
All four of my pockets full now

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo & Lil Baby]
I can't be totin' no handguns (Glock)
Unless that bitch come with a thirty (with a thirty)
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy (with a friend)
I can't be drivin' no regular cars (skrt)
That bitch gotta come with a button (a button)
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of a sudden
I can't be rappin' for free, they gotta send me the budget (send me that)
I can't be fuckin' these hoes raw, I had to slip on a rubber (slip in that)
I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my cups be muddy
I just came home with nothin' (woo)
Now I'm up all of a sudden (hey)
Now I'm up all of a sudden (hey)
Now I'm up all of a sudden (hey, hey)

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Moneybagg, Moneybagg (fuck with it)
I'm in the booth with a money bag
Here go the bricks, where the money at?
Give me a load, I ain't comin' back
I make 'em shoot where your stomach at
We gon' pull up where your mama at
Runnin' through hoes like a running back
We can fuck but you can't call this number back
If you knew better, baby you'd do better
I got plenty hoes, call me Hugh Hefner
I'm with MoneyBagg, we went four federal
Four Pockets, Bread Gang, who better?

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo & Lil Baby]
I can't be totin' no handguns
Unless that bitch come with a thirty
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy
I can't be drivin' no regular cars
That bitch gotta come with a button
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of the sudden
I can't be rappin' for free, they gotta send me the budget
I can't be fuckin' these hoes raw, I had to slip on a rubber
I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my cups be muddy

[Verse 2: MoneyBagg Yo]
If I said fuck you I meant that
I'm whippin' this coupe, I ain't rent that
The shit that you savin', I spent that
And if you want smoke you can get that
I just want proof of the backend
Any time I fuck her I hit from the back end
I'm pullin' her hair while I dig in her
She like hold up baby, keep my tracts in
I can't hit that bitch raw, got a glove on me
I'm in the trap with the drugs one me
I just went bonkers all up, Exclusive Game
Fly as fuck like a dove on me
Diamonds wet like a tub on me
Hurricane Harvey, flood on me
Left the spot with a dub on me
Walk in the spot, bitches tug on me

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo & Lil Baby]
I can't be totin' no handguns
Unless that bitch come with a thirty
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy
I can't be drivin' no regular cars
That bitch gotta come with a button
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of the sudden
I can't be rappin' for free, they gotta send me the budget
I can't be fuckin' these hoes raw, I had to slip on a rubber
I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my kush be muddy
I just came home with nothin'
Now I'm up all of the sudden
Hey, now I'm up all of the sudden, hey
Now I'm up all of the sudden
I just came home with nothin'
Now I'm up all of the sudden
Hey, now I'm up all of the sudden, hey
Now I'm up all of the sudden



[Chorus]
Don't wanna pretend with you
Talking India
I wanna do everything under the sun

[Verse 1]
I can't lie, I can't tell my guys

And we both turnt up we from the Chi
But I don't ask about her other guy
I just wanna eat you alive
Be seen with you just put me in your line
These niggas be hating don't want me in your life
You gon' hear stories about me that shit ain't right
The way you lick your lips
The way you bite 'em
The way you answer your facetime I like 'em
I don't got no hoes no more, I'm show you
When she make me go down low hear my vocals
She just think I'm talking

Them perks I swallow make me want you I'm just honest
I can't lie no more
Late night don't hang out with my guys no more
And you fine ain't gotta be finer no more

It started in her DM I had to get it

[Chorus]
Don't wanna pretend with you

[Verse 2]
I wanted you and you knew this shit
Won't brag you with no money cause you used to it
I say I want a wife they say I'm losing it
Before we move too fast we was cooling it
Durkio, I'mma make you scream my name, Durkio
This shit ain't for the fame, Durkio
Too real, too real for games, Durkio
I never been a lame, I just stay in my lane
She can get designer she don't want it
She just wanna stay too plain
I like her she not goofy, she only like real niggas not no goofies
She about her paper, that blue cheese
She tweeted about a nigga and it blew me
I know what I gotta do

I just know what I gotta get

See I had that young mind young mind

[Chorus]
Don't wanna pretend with you

Square I don't ever wanna see yo ass
Yea, I know imma dog that shit ain't fair

Diamonds in the air like chandeliers
If she around then I'm aware
You say ''only him'' you lyin' again
Bluetooth in the coupe you need to pair
That hoe shit was in the air
If yo friends a hoe then you's a hoe
Wherever you go I know they go
Don't follow your dream you follow bankrolls
Yo ass so fake thought you was ten toes

[Verse]
Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous
So much more than perfect (yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I can work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't ever asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone the family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

[Chorus]
Look at the sky tonight, all little stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all little stars have a reason



[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback
For the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other mothafuckas'
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growin' sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?

[Refrain]
Nothin' like them other mothafuckers'
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
Nothin' like them other mothafuckers'
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)

[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback
For the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other mothafuckas'
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growin' sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?

[Bridge]
Down another lonely road, I go
Just another lonely road, oh
I just wanna know, I just gotta know
Do you wanna glo? Baby, we could glo

[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback
For the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other mothafuckas'
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growin' sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?

[Outro]
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?
Nothin' like them other mothafuckas'
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)

[Intro: Lil Skies]
CashMoneyAP
Aye, aye, aye

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a fuck, I keep it real I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me fuck
Want me to cum inside
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was saucin' down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But niggas don't stick to the G-code, balling on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose
Do 'em like I'm Deebo

[Pre-Hook: Lil Skies]
Aye, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking shit girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really fuck with nobody (I can't really fuck with nobody, so)

[Pre-Hook: Lil Skies]
Aye, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin



[Intro]
Menoh

[Hook: Lil Skies]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
I roll up the Mary Jane, no they can't feel my pain
I'm still trapping everyday, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a porn star, a rock star
Trying to skirt off in that fast car, like NASCAR
Girl you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki and she like it sloppy
Oh you got a hotty body, come ride on my Johnny
Imma go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights I'm flying, no you can't see me
Say you need me but you deceive me

[Hook: Lil Skies]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I ain’t never forgotten, not a soul worth remembering
Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a god damn rock star
That blunt ash on the floor
Well she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know
Toke
Took a drag out that wood now she goin for my wood
So we going to my hood
Yea she gonna get it good
And she know who we are
She want this rock star life and she said I'm going far
And she off a bar
And she can't feel her face no more
Yeah she off a bar and she can't feel her face no more
She said she can't feel her face no more



[Intro]
Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right

Countin' them bands
All way to the top 'til they be fallin' over
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
Countin' them bands
On my way to the top 'til we fallin' over

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

[Verse 1]
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out (hey)
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "I am not afraid to die."
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge (yeah)
All my friends are dead, yeah, ooh
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

[Verse 2]
That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (ooh, yeah)
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some (yeh, yeh)
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge]
She say: "You're the worst, you're the worst."
I cannot die because this my universe

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge



[Pre-Chorus]
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
Hello I was listening to this song
It goes like

[Chorus]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

[Verse 1]
Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only trying to show you things
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring
I had to get a me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii looking at the rain
She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame
(broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi)
That just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
Oh get over it

[Chorus]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

[Verse 2]
I tied up my RAF you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'ma let her
Go over there with that broke fella
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather
My new chick I swear that she better
Want me back, never (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

[Chorus: Oh Wonder & Lil Uzi Vert]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (woah)
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it (you'll get over it)
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (no,no)
You'll find another life to live (you will)
I know that you'll get over it (oh)

[Outro: Oh Wonder & Lil Uzi Vert]
You'll get over it
You'll get over it
You'll get over it
You'll get over it
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her



[Intro]
Huh? Ayy
You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson beat
What? Yeah, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Pop the trunk, I open up, I sold my soul for a good price
Outta sight, and my hoe got talent, right?
Whole squad ran through that shit, yikes
Ayy, I’m a business man, I did my business, damn
But I'ma bend it down and I'ma lick her up, then dick her down
She gon' turn around then I'm gon' kick her out
She gon' talk that shit but say
How you make it up? How you fake a love?
Holy son, I was the chosen one
I'm sippin' out the grail, she gon' kiss and tell
She keep my wishes well (but) I don't need her, well
How my enemy a friend of me?
Why y'all feed off my energy? Like I ain't dead yet
Higher entity, foreign bitch that think she into me
Whip the foreign very viciously
Why these dudes wanna take pics with me?
She said she gay but still into me, said she gay but still into me
Said that she hates that I'm in the streets
And said that I hate that I'm in the streets
I wanna blow up or make history
And she said that she hate my Insta feed

[Chorus]
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
And Xans gon' betray you
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you

[Verse 2]
And her pussy tastes like Skittles, what?
Yeah, ayy, and you can really taste the rainbow, what? (hah, no)
Yo' bitch just like a crayola (what, ayy)
You can draw her on the table, flip her like some yola
Heart shaped kisses, I really miss my mistress
666, evil bitches want my mentions
Heart shaped kisses, I really miss my mistress
And it's 666, evil bitches want my mentions

[Chorus]
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
And Xans gon' betray you
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you

[Intro]
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, damn

[Chorus]
Poppin' a bean (ooh, yeah)
I lost my spleen (oh, yeah)
You ever been so fucked up? (damn)
I lost all my friends, they broke trust, yo (yeah, yo)

Crashed the whip, I'll see you later
My whip red, it stay Darth Vader

So y'all gon' act like I'm not big
Like how the fuck I get this far?

Heartbreak soldiers
Xanarchy militia

So y'all gon' act like I'm not big
Like how the fuck I get this far?
How the fuck I drive this car?



[Verse 1]
Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can't keep

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

[Verse 2 ]
The reminders, pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

[Instrumental + Bridge]
(I do)

[Chorus/Outro]
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do
Well I do



[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, they didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter



[BURR]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross’ flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who’s unafraid to step in!
He’s constantly confusin’, confoundin’ the British henchmen
Ev’ryone give it up for America’s favorite fighting Frenchman!

And so the balance shifts

We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[LAFAYETTE]
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there is someone else we need:

Ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean—

Oh, Alexander Hamilton

The world will never be the same, Alexander…



(Lights up on Aaron Burr & the company.)

[AARON BURR]
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[JOHN LAURENS]
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter

[THOMAS JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[JAMES MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name. What’s your name, man?”

[ALEXANDER HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there’s a million things I haven’t done
But just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA HAMILTON]
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick

[FULL COMPANY EXCEPT HAMILTON (whispering)]
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

[GEORGE WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin’ but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying

[WASHINGTON]
“You gotta fend for yourself.”

[COMPANY]
“Alex, you gotta fend for yourself.”

[WASHINGTON]
He started retreatin’ and readin’ every treatise on the shelf

[BURR]
There would have been nothin’ left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin’, clerkin’ for his late mother’s landlord
Tradin’ sugar cane and rum and all the things he can’t afford
Scammin’ for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin’ for the future see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[COMPANY]
Scammin’

Plannin’
Oooh...

[COMPANY]
In New York you can
Be a new man—
In New York you can
Be a new man—

[HAMILTON]
Just you wait!

Just you wait!
[COMPANY]
In New York you can be a new man—

[WOMEN]
In New York—
 
[MEN]
New York—
[HAMILTON]
Just you wait!

When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?

[BURR]
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him

Another immigrant
Comin’ up from the bottom

His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him

Waiting in the wings for you

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore



[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking her cheek

[Chorus]
They say, "You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Verse 2]
The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

[Chorus]
They say, "You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Outro]
They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun



[Verse 1: Lorde]
A couple rebel top gun pilots
Flyin' with nowhere to be, oh
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lines
Seeing me rollin', showin' someone else love
Dancin' with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?

[Chorus: Lorde]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Verse 2: Khalid]
I wanna feel the light, pushin' our limits
Unbuckled for the ride, mhmm
We're way too far from home
Let's be honest with ourselves
We're way too high to drive
So let's take on the night
If the light is in the air
Open, finally, we're goin' and we're free

[Chorus: Khalid & Lorde]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Verse 3: SZA]
I checked your girl at the door
I sent your friend to the store
It's only me and you, finally us two
And I don't regret drinkin' this liquor, makin' you listen
Yeah, I know you don't know me well
My girl's at the door
And I left my pretense at home
And it ain't no goin' back (goin' back)

[Chorus: SZA & Lorde]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Verse 4: Post Malone]
Walk, never fall, but we still run
So pour up, pour up another one
I know, I know we on to somethin'
We got, we got a loaded gun, yeah
Go and shoot me the look in your eyes
And you're here, I'm yours, you're mine
Find each other when we're losin' our minds
Then we take it all off
You're a runaway train, yeah
And you got me so faded
And I don't wanna chase it, no
You know I think you're awesome, right?

[Chorus: All]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite, yeah, yeah
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowin' shit up

[Outro: Lorde]
Now you know it's really gonna blow



[Jenny Lind]
I'm trying to hold my breath
Let it stay this way
Can't let this moment end
You set off a dream with me
Getting louder now
Can you hear it echoing?
Take my hand
Will you share this with me?
'Cause darling without you

All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the nightsky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough
Never be enough

For me
Never, never
Never, never
Never, for me
For me
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough
For me
For me
For me

All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the nightsky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough
Never be enough

For me
Never, never
Never, never
Never, for me
For me
Never enough
Never, never
Never enough
Never, never
Never enough
For me
For me
For me

For me



[Chorus: Jenny Lind]
All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the nightsky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough
Never be enough





Letra del remix de "Despacito" con Justin Bieber, Luis Fonsi y Daddy Yankee[English Translation]

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Comin' over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

[Verso 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

[Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi / Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Verso 2: Daddy Yankee]
Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee & Justin Bieber / Daddy Yankee]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!

[Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi / Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Puente: Luis Fonsi]
Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, "¡Ay, Bendito!"
I can move forever cuando esté contigo
¡Bailalo!

[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee, Luis Fonsi & Justin Bieber]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (D.Y.)
Despacito
