Reminiscin' 'bout the trap, playin' the first Carter
My life changed when I had my first daughter
Got my first quarter flippin' fifty-dollar slabs
Your nigga's lookin' at the bills, askin' you for half
Cut from a different cloth, take pride in results

You keep playin' with me, I end up signing your boss
Drop an EP on a nigga for the free-free on a nigga
Yeah you ZZ on a nigga, king like BB on you niggas

All that bullshit is up under me
Smokin' gas ain't no tumble weed

[Chorus: Pharrell WIlliams]
You, you, you, you, you
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth
Maybe your friends are confused
I'm gonna tell you the truth
Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
All week, keeping on, my mind is...
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe now, but not next time
Going in, going in, going in, going in
There we go, that' it for sure
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe just a little more
Going in, going in, going in, going in

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Juicy, squeeze it, then juicy
Sipping on the D'usse
Rocking some Medusa, give a fuck what you say
Give a fuck what you say
In the club, I wrote this for the plug
I wrote this for a hater that was looking for some love
A DJ competition, I'm mixing in the kitchen
Now who gon' do the dishes
Bankroll thicker than Deelishis

[Chorus: Pharrell WIlliams]
You, you, you, you, you
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth
Maybe your friends are confused
I'm gonna tell you the truth
Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
All week, keeping on, my mind is...
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe now, but not next time
Going in, going in, going in, going in
There we go, that' it for sure
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe just a little more
Going in, going in, going in, going in

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Drug connotation in my population
I want a conversation, don't want no confrontation
Pull up in a hardtop, watch how I race it
Trap to the wrap like watch how I embrace it
Louis Vans on, they don't come with laces
And we talking straight shots, we don't need no chaser
Tell her I don't chase her, swap her, I replace it
Bracelet, this is Rollie, Rollie, this is bracelet
Pass the medication
Rounds upon rounds, I am nowhere around
I'm nowhere to be found
I'm on flights over lights, I'm so close up to Christ
I might ask for advice, I might ask for it twice
Look at my ice, I'm so nice, it's like Mardi Gras
Mama I shot me a man, please go hide the gun
When she ask me my number, I say I'm the one
Rushing summer to summer until someone come

[Chorus: Pharrell WIlliams]
You, you, you, you, you
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth
Maybe your friends are confused
I'm gonna tell you the truth
Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
All week, keeping on, my mind is...
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe now, but not next time
Going in, going in, going in, going in
There we go, that' it for sure
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe just a little more
Going in, going in, going in, going in

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Go ahead and touch the sky
Go ahead and touch the sky
Dancing where you are
Go ahead and touch the sky

Lean, soda, cream, soda
Shawty thick, small waist
Fat ass, gon’ shake
Money tall, Tyra Banks
We everything y’all ain’t
Couldn’t believe in Santa Claus ‘cause I ain’t have no chimney
Soufside with a F and the F for Fendi
I’m the type of guy to buy a extra Bentley
Had two SS’s like Mississippi
One phone call and I can get some pussy
One phone call, I know you niggas pussy
This the shit you play when you in the bushes
This the shit you play when you hit the bookie

This that clique you hate, but this that here to stay
This that shit you play, this that clique you know
‘Bout that trigger play, trigger finger roll
But this ain’t NBA, this the CEO
And this ain’t MMA, but this a TKO
Rolls Royce Wraith, I park that bitch and skate
I talk that shit, she caught that line, I call that fish filet
And all of my niggas is A1, and y’all lil niggas look like steak (well done)
And all my woes is athletic, and none of my hoes is getting pregnant
Don’t dab, don’t dance
Do me, own swag
Leather soft, you niggas softer
What’s that smell? Rigor mortis
South Beach, socks off
Money, drugs in the sock drawer
Fuck her good, get a round of applause
This the shit I play when I go to drop a bitch off

Whole lot of money that my BFF
Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt
Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet
You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage
Young street nigga coming from the pot
Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict
They say that money talk so don't you make a comment
I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Done it, done it, done it man I'm runnin' up
Tity Boi 'bout to fuck the summer up
Order some new things for the Wraith
3rd chain on to get her naked
I'ma poster child for the hustle
You a poser child for them bustas
Game up for grabs, I'ma take it
Try to stay down like the pavement
Live by the code, keep it true
Anything and everything to get a loot
Nigga think they trill but I'm triller
Nigga think they ill but I'm iller
Nigga think they big but I'm larger
Pussy you ain't nothin' but a target
Smokin' on joints, gettin' massages
Keep dodgin' me and I charge up

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
In first class they ask me what I do
Had a stove, microwave and a blender too
Pull up on your set in a 62
Pull up on your set just to send em through
Shittin' on them niggas like an enema
Fuck the bitch, had to say I'm into her
Nigga know I know I been winnin'
Niggas I know I know I don't give any fucks
Sold my Monte Carlo, bought a Cadillac
Sold my Cadillac and went and got a Beamer
I used to put my drawls in the cleaners
Trap down the street from Phillips Arena
Spend a lil money you can't take it with ya
They said the feds out here takin' pictures
Well I'm the freshest nigga on their Instagram
Hashtag making bands, yes I am

[Hook: 2 Chainz]

I'ma tell you, I'ma tell you this right now
If you, if you woke up this mornin', nigga you winnin' for real
(Buddha Bless this beat)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I got a big amount, I took a different route
I am the pick of the litter
I was in juvy, they gave me community
I had to pick up some litter
I want it easy, please do not tease me
I wore my Yeezys to dinner
This is the season, I got the seasonin'
Don't make me sprinkle you niggas
I got my reasons, you wanna please me
Send me the pussy, not pictures
Met her this week and fucked her this evenin'
She turn a freak on the liquor
Yeah, I am a boss on these bitches
Yeah, I pour some Voss on these bitches
Yeah, I have no thoughts on these bitches
Yeah, rock double cross on these bitches, yeah
Dearly departed, gather today
On some Prince shit
You know what they say
Me and my safe, got a friendship
Ten on me, thin weight, flip weight, gettin' paid
Gettin' laid
Bitch made, took off sick days
6 trey, 6-4 bounce, bitch, bounce
Hood nigga, favorite spot was the Waffle House
Patty melt with the hash browns
Tryna avoid all the pat downs
Tryna avoid all the lame hoes
Weirdos in the background
Black out when I back out
Blow the horn for a pedestrian
Shawty ride like an equestrian
I bought the dress that she in
Red bottoms in his and hers
Got a Rollie in his and hers
Got a car in his and hers
Walk in the zoo and say, "Pick a fur"
Last night was a blur to me
This mornin' I got two with me
I don't know what to do with me
Goin' ape like the zoo with me
Got a tool with the screw missin'
Two girls in the pool kissin'
Everywhere I go, the rod with me
'Cause these niggas actin' too fishy

[Interlude: Drake]
Fuck y'all niggas on, man?
Duffle bag forever
Just left V Live
Atlanta could never die as long as Tit alive
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I got a big amount
I think I'm the biggest out
Got hits and I ain't even put 'em out
Lit and you can't even put it out
Got the Billboard melodies
Rap is somethin' I do on the side
Crossed over to the other side
And I didn't even have to die
Got the money and I never show it
Let a nigga try to play heroic
Michael Jackson talkin' to me in my dreams
And he say, "You bad and you know it"
Better shamone with my check then
I'm a J. Prince investment
Niggas love to talk reckless
Then see me like best friends
Got the sand-colored FN
And I've never seen the inside of a Marriott or a Westin
Five stars, nothin' less than
Fuck niggas on your payroll
And you let 'em know the safe code
And you knew him for a month though
But you call them niggas big bro
You could move in the Hidden Hills
And we still don't live by the same code
I'm respected everywhere I go
Nigga, long live Bankroll
Skip the rainbow, funny style shit
And it's straight to the pot of gold
Somebody, everybody know
6 God with the god flow
Yeah, yeah



I think I may have to take it back to like, like 10 years ago, you know
BIG MEECH ERA (you feel me?)
Real Real Motivation for a street nigga  *2

VERSE 1
Pull up in all color Ferraris
Bitches in Tiaras
Gettin' head while I'm steering
Everybody else starving
Everybody else starring
Shawty got the Mclarian and I had the 7

Pulled up at the Compound, clothes smelling like gun powder
Salute all the real niggas and real bitches who got they own bottles
I was snapping before fabo my raps come wit aHalo
Went out with Jeezy we spent pesos like J-bo
Took E’s to the 20 grand he got a pistol on him and 20 grand
A couple things I ain't glorifying is the kids dying and the mommas dying (Scarface)
Everybody need to calm down stand right by your homie  side
Gunshots in this motherfucker turn this bitch into a homie-side (yeah)

CHORUS
Over a million sold they say Im crossing over..
Oh yeah the club packed, I should’ve brought a rubber
My whole body inked, my family hardly know me
You know I put that work in just to get a Rollie (I did)
BIG MEECH ERA
Japanese Dinner
Trap in these denim  (damn)
Ain't stuntin these women (naaa)
Wood Grain steering wheel I just might catch a splinter. (
If this a flexing contest I think we found a winner
I think we found a winner
Pull up in some shorts middle of December

“Put this shit down, that shit, I can smell that moon rock “
I got  to tell you how that shit started
Verse 2
Trapping off the court on the back porch (I DID)
Had that pack ordered. We was back door. (We was nigga!)
That’s that good shit that’s that hood shit (WE HOOD)
You a cute bitch and your crew thick (I LIED)
Got a chopper on me the size of pool stick (this long)
With a blu davenchy, dog food bricks (Heroin)
Snowman on repeat, Rest In Peace Nando
I see Jigg in here I see Quazy too
When brawl witchu we send them bottles through we send the marters through
Im on the Carter 2
Like Tyrese was on the Marta too
They start calling too
They starting falling through
Got them chickens boy like a barb b q (tell em)
Talk to lame niggas something we hardly do
I sip the PJ bottle I rock the AP on them. (okay)
I think my rollie harder this an AG PARTY

CHORUS *2



[Intro]
Yah! Tru

[Hook]
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
If I know you, I'ma bless you
You my folks, I'ma bless you
If I love you, I'ma bless you
If I trust you, it's a blessing
If you flexin', then it's a blessing
And if they test you, then it's a blessing

[Verse 1]
When I'm alone in my room, sometimes it look like the mall
In the back of my mind, I ball harder than y'all
I used to have an old school that I sat on some dubs
For the first time in my life, mama knew I sold drugs
There it was, hustlin' across the way
Went in on my first ounce with Big Shay
AG had orange, DC had white
Lil cuz got murked, you ain't seen that life
I done bought at least two chains more than twice
Count money from the night 'til the mornin' light
Had a convo with God, I told him, "Thank you, Lord

[Chorus: Quavo]
50,000 on me, I'm a walkin' lick
She fuck with the squad, she gon' grip the stick
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
I've been drinkin' codeine all night
Got your bitch out her DM, put her on a flight
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
My side chick got pregnant by her main dude and I'm offended
I called, she ain't pick up, I text her back, bitch you stingy
I'm in all black like a ninja, chain got influenza
Walk in the traphouse, use my Cartiers for credentials (God damn!)
I'm going wildebeest, all on my enemies
Negative energy, I could do anything, I got the guillotine
Off with they head
Known to pull off and get head
Drippin so much sauce on your bitch look like she wettin' the bed
I could do more than just say it, strip club veteran head uh uh!
I am still gettin' this bread, bought her a Birkin bag uh uh!
Everyone look at the tag, I do the digital dash uh uh!
I can do more than just brag, I can back it up UH UH!

[Chorus: Quavo]
50,000 on me, I'm a walkin' lick
She fuck with the squad, she gon' grip the stick
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
I've been drinkin' codeine all night
Got your bitch out her DM, put her on a flight
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs

[Verse 2: Offset]
Blue cheese, no ranch, all hunnids
10 racks on me that's mall money
I just bought a Lamb Ima crawl on it
Get on top, she act a dog with it
I'm on this drink need to slow down
Racks in back it won't slow down
You had a sack but it's gone now
Safari diamond, money long now
Better wake up, smell the coffee
Black man with a lot of money, got the white man wanna off me
You was my mans but you lost me
Poppin xans, I'm exhausted
Cookie smellin like a mosh pit
Pop a perk, kinda nauseous
50 pointer, shit colossus
Hey, With this money I could stay up and survive
We go live, smoke this dope and ride
We too fly, bad bitches in the archive
Oh so high, money make me so high

[Chorus: Quavo]
50,000 on me, I'm a walkin' lick
She fuck with the squad, she gon' grip the stick
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I'm havin blue cheese
And I'ma get it by any means
Flexing on niggas like Hercules
Fucking on bitches with double D's
I met the plug, got 100 keys
Give me that block and I gotta seize
These niggas sick of me, wanna get rid of me
I'm at the top and they under me
I hit the lot and don't ask for the tag
Racks in my pockets, they lookin like kneepads
Flex in my Off Whites with Benjamin Franklin
Put the rest of that blue cheese in the bag
My life I'm livin it fast
One thing I cannot do is go out sad
They know me but don't know my past
And if you know me you know I'm about my cash
The Nawfside, call it Baghdad, make a nigga 40 yard dash
The Nawfside, where the bags at, I was breakin my wrist in the glass (Whippin it!)
Smoking on Barry Bonds in the Huracan, spinning work like I'm Taz
Migos and Chainz in the city, go to your girl car
Had to bring out that bag

[Chorus: Quavo]
50,000 on me, I'm a walkin' lick
She fuck with the squad, she gon' grip the stick
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Came from the rags to riches, now we got bags and bitches
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
I've been drinkin' codeine all night
Got your bitch out her DM, put her on a flight
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
I've been drinkin' codeine all night
Got your bitch out her DM, put her on a flight
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs

[Bridge: Quavo (2 Chainz)]
When you wake up in the morning
When you wake up in the morning
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
Blue cheese in my Off Whites
(Uhh, uhh)

[Outro]
Boy, my uncle 12 shawty
I had to take my uncle to school this morning shawty
And he got suspended
'Cause he smelled like weed when he got there



[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I mind fucked an intellectual
Had sex with her on my sectional
Slowed it down, take it extra slow
Bust on myself like Plaxico
Oh alright here I go
Shorty got my love in the finger fold
I got a manicure, pedicure
I got her hair done and credit card new
I'm balling on her big time
Told shorty I'm 6'5"
Stand up on my bankroll, make me look like I'm 6'9"
She look like she been fine
She always call me big time
Pinky ring on, you should see the way I sip wine
I'm maestro in the main suite
Make a side chick out your main squeeze
Better hop on board 'fore the train leave
Shorty outta place cause I slang D
And I'm changes need my chain freeze
Meant to say my chain froze
Everytime I change clothes

[Hook: Betty Idol]
Cherish the game
When we fly far away
Sky dive in a puddle of mud
Make it rain blue dolphin
All I see is blue dolphin
(x2)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I like when she smile
She like when I make her smile
She like when I put it down
She like when I come in town
I like when she on the brown
She like when I'm on the loud
Seen her take some coke then smile
Seen her take a perc then pow
Birkin bag see no salt
All on the beach with toes out
All on the beach sea gulls out
All in the jeep windows down
Where I come from the Regals out
She knows I turn up on the molly
She doing string thing for money
I'm trying to put it in her tummy
I might whisper in her earlobe
I'm blowing kisses in her earlobe
I'm telling things she ain't built for
Money long as Lincoln Continentals
Codeine with a touch of Sprite
Geeked up for a hundred nights
I'm a roll had a Cuban link
In a figaro this a finger roll

[Hook]

(Musical Break)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
3 chainz, owww
Caught up in my bullshit, put your head on backwards
And skate off after, engage in laughter ‘bout what just happened
Fingers in napkins get sent to mammies; is that too graphic?
Catch you in traffic, you sitting daffy like stealing candy
My ceiling’s absent, my wheels are massive, my friends assassins
All of us bastards, our mothers queens and our women dancers
My rivers rapid, my fins are splashin’, my gills are flappin’
I bit some matches, then sipped some gas and went, kiss the dragon

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I’m really rappin’, no finger snappin’, I’m pistol packin’
Y’all niggas slippin’, my swag is drippin’, so here’s a napkin
What’s really happnin’ bro?
Verbal attackin’, I’m showing passion
Know what I mean, see I’m the king like I’m from Akron
I’m going overboard, somebody call the captain
And when it come to getting checks, I always want the fat ones
I’m so high I can sing to a chandelier
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Too many bitches, too many blunts, too many buttons
Not enough bullets, them niggas buggin’, the swat is comin’
AK on shoulder, no shoulder shruggin’, aim at ya nugget
My weed sticky like acupuncture and magnets, honey
Knock on the side door three times and have your money
Or get to steppin’ like Kappas stompin’, I’ll slap a junkie
I’m having lunch with Italian Sonny, don’t ask the subject
Lord, why you took Rabbit from me? He say "don’t ask me nothing"
Too many bodies, too many bangers, too many bundles
Not enough bullets, these niggas buggin’, I heard they stung you
It’s gon’ be trouble, we come through and catch you while you cuddle
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga, don’t even mumble

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
I’m back to ballin’, I’m in the back full of magnums only
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy
Our weed ready, turkey spaghetti and caster oil
That’s codeine turn your guillotine to a fashion show
In 4 minutes I’ll turn this into forensics
In a foreign car with a foreign broad that’s long winded
Paper long, and you taking long, you just don’t get it
Hung the phone up on Satan, told me he want a song with me
Hotter than Mississippi in summer of 1950s
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches
Get pulled over for swervin’ like “Hi, officer”
When he ask me why I was swerving, “I’m high, officer”

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Got a mansion, a condo, a cabin, I sleep in my Phantom
So high dancing with the stars to the Star Spangled Banner
I change your channel, I change your pattern, I ring your Saturn
I bang your madam, she get on top and I shake the ladder
I make her straddle then gather and calculate the data
I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle
I play the shadows, don’t play no games, I straight get at ‘em
I’m on the chronic all day like it’s my favorite album

[Verse 6: 2 Chainz]
A plate of salmon, the Cayman Islands, a stripper dancer
If I don’t get the car first, I’ll have a temper tantrum
I’m innovative, I demonstrated, this nickle plated
I don’t care if you owe me a nick, nigga you need to pay me
I kiss ya lady, eat her pussy, then kiss the baby
Get situated, get keys off table, then leave her 80
I really made it, get it maid, Schwarzenegger
Won’t wrestle niggas, I spatula all you action figures

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
I’m so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell
These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail
I feed it to my fun girls, they say fuck yeah

[Verse 8: 2 Chainz]
I’m doing this shit like whatever
When I go I’mma leave for the better
I told her you dig like a shovel
I want a Ferrari in yellow
Just so I can match all my yellow bitches
I been a playa since elementary
I got more bars than a penitentiary
I got a clip that hang several inches

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself



[Intro: Louis Farrakhan & Monica]
As I met 2 Chainz a few minutes ago, as I gazed into his face, I felt that I was in the presence of royalty. There's a certain power presence that he gives off
I tried to be, everything you want and need

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
'Cause you got a deep title don't mean that you deep
Substance shallow on shit creek, I heard Cole speak
About the bricks, Kendrick got Compton lit
And I've been lit ever since I sold nicks
Never fabricated about my fabric, the scale, that's my apparatus
I give a fuck about the sorriest rappers
This actually happened, path in the back pathogenic
Moved that blow out like we were afrocentric
I had a front row entry, I had the codeine kidney
I made up the Bentiaga truck, you owe me a Bentley
This the rap Ken Griffey, got at least 10 with me
Got at least 10 on me, I'm anti-phony
My girl anti-bony and she get that money
I bought all this shit, don't go acting anti on me
It's Mr. Epps in the bank, I give a F what you think
I bought a Tesla today, there's nothing left in your tank
I did everything except a fucking song with Jay
But I murdered every song I fucking did with Ye
See my verses are better and my subject is realer
See my mom was an addict and my dad was the dealer
And their son is that nigga, I'm no Black activist
I'm a Black millionaire, give you my Black ass to kiss
We used the tree for a fence, I used to land in the trench
Used to dust myself off, then I eat me some shrimp
Coulda did anything, I coulda been me a pimp
I coulda went to the league, I took it straight to the rim
I took it straight to the block, I got Xans in my sock
I got plans for the pot, I got bands, you do not, huh

[Interlude: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, you a miracle. Right now, if you hear this, you're a miracle, I want you to know that. If you're able to hear this right now, you are a miracle. Straight up, no kapp

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I'm more Gucci than Vans, give you a Gucci advance
This the chance of your life, you ain't prepared for your life
See the man without a mic is just a mic gimmick
Anyone, Jordan, Jackson, Tyson, Bivens
Phone number unlisted
Gave her the digits to a number that is long distance
She on the wrong mission and got my palm itching
I had it on me, you can see it in my prom pictures, ugh

[Interlude: 2 Chainz]
I'm telling you, niggas like me fall out the sky. You don't just bump into me. I'm a real blessing, bro, nah, for real, bro

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
You know the times is rough, you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors, so we got burglar bars
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars, Lord, yeah, okay
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars, Lord, Lord

[Bridge: Monica]
Lord knows
Woke up today, gave thanks
Grateful to see another day, then the storm came
As the night falls, I shed my blood, sweat and tears
Let the rain fall, let it fall, let it fall
One day
Your love will take me right over the stars, Lord knows

[Outro: 2 Chainz]
That soulful trap music, man. Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout Section 8, I'm talkin' 'bout the 'partments. You stay in the middle, someone stay on top of you, someone stay below you. What you know about grabbing a broom and shit and hitting upstairs like, "Y'all stop fucking stomping! Y'all stop walking so mothafuckin' hard!" Then the people downstairs, they doing the same shit to us. Tru, trill shit



[Intro]
Yeah man, you know
I just gotta get this shit off my chest, I do, I do
I'm tired of it, I'm sayin' this shit all the time
Like niggas takin' the style, niggas takin' everything a nigga do
I'm 'bout to get an alarm for my shit
Nigga get close to my shit, I'm puttin' a chirp on that shit
Shit gon' go off on niggas
Brr brr! You dig what I'm sayin'?

[Hook]
Try to take my style, nigga, brr brr
Try to take my bitch, nigga, brr brr
Damn, try to take my swag, nigga, brr brr

Yeah, try to hit my gas, nigga, brr brr
Thumbin' through the cash, nigga, brr brr
Thousand dollar pants, nigga, brr brr
Shit, try to take my dance, nigga, brr brr

[Verse 1]
I got Bloods in Savannah
I got Crips on Old National
On your ho like a fashion
Pinky ring on Alaska
Illest nigga in Nebraska
Nigga fake like wrastlin'
Got cash or plastic
Big cash, cappin'
Six Flags, lotta rides
Turn the beat to a homicide
Microphone look mortified
Lyrical bullets is a .45
I'm doin' 75 on the 75
85 off of 85
200 on 285
None of my cars take 89
Down to get money any time
Life a bitch with no panty line
Us versus the other squad
Stash spot is my boxer shorts
Just stickin' to the protocol
Weed smellin' like underarm
Turn you suckers into bubblegum

[Hook]
Try to take my style, nigga, brr brr
Try to take my bitch, nigga, brr brr
Damn, try to take my swag, nigga, brr brr
Yeah, try to take my bag, nigga, brr brr
Yeah, try to hit my gas, nigga, brr brr
Thumbin' through the cash, nigga, brr brr
Thousand dollar pants, nigga, brr brr
Shit, try to take my dance, nigga, brr brr

[Verse 2]
I just might stand on the car
Stand on the wall
Logos on my bag
Logo on my scarf
Yeah I met her tonight
Fuck her tomorrow
You know how we are
You know who we are
Yeah the trap is my workplace
You know I came from a hurt place
Had to reverse it to first place
To father, hustler in first place
And I said word for word
I usually smoke at work
I either smirk or flirt
Took it from hard to vert
I got some word to off
Them bitches bumpin' soft
Young niggas stealin' sauce
I'm tryna drill 'em off
I'm tryna kill this off
I bring the women out
I'm 'bout to build a house
Then I'ma rent it out, woah!

[Hook]
Try to take my style, nigga, brr brr
Try to take my bitch, nigga, brr brr
Damn, try to take my swag, nigga, brr brr

[Outro]
You already know that's me though, stay drenched
Every time you see me, I'm drenched
I'm the freshest nigga in the room, you dig what I'm sayin'?
I'm soaked, uh
We gon' need some wet floor signs in here, people, please
It's the drench god, we don't want nobody to fall
Slip up on this sauce, mane

We having fun, we just doing stuff, we don’t even care about
(Go get my shit)
Young Money, we care

[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
If it wasn’t for Wayne, it wouldn’t be
A lot of dudes in the game, including me
We was smoking that gas in ’03
Was gon’ sell a few bags to Lil Fee
Couple years removed from HBs
Tatted lyrics from Jigga to Jay-Z
I went to Eastover before Katrina
Remember going to Magic riding in my Beamer
And this was way before FEMA, and you was rappin’ and singin’
And I was slanging the Ps and smoking nigga like Newport
Comin up off of Too Short, my underwear was my hoop shorts
And then I went on tour and recorded songs on your tour bus
And that was ’08, that’s the first time I met Drake
When I hit your cup with that drank, had a nigga stomach like wait

[Hook]
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
Yea, that my dog, that my dog uhh
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
That my dio, yea that my dog..........

[Verse 2]
You relocated to MIA
You told me shawdy this where I stay
I came down to pay a visit
You told me Zoe Pound and them was trippin'
And you, you wasn’t dippin’
Had the M-16 and with the extra clip, ready to act ignorant
Ridin’ off in the Phantom, and Mr. G he was driving
Pumpin’ that Playaz Circle, you told me that we was riding
And I told you that I was rappin’, I told you I wasn’t writing
You said Luda was foolish because he wasn’t excited
That was way before Tyga, I saw Nicki with Gucci
You said, “You can make a million rappin’ ‘bout some pussy, I did.”
T, Fuke, Mally Mal, shining like Armor Oil
You can ask Mack, I was YM ‘fore all of y’all
Stunna said I reminded him of Johnny
In this world you either selling or you buying

[Hook]
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
Yea, that my dog, that my dog uhh
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
That my dog, yea that my dog..........

[Verse 3]
You tatted your face and changed the culture
You screamed soowoo and them gangstas loved it
You bought a Bugatti so you can flex
And most of the bad bitches your ex
Ride ‘til the wheels fall off and they got wobbly
Duffle Bag video, we shot that bitch on Godby
You was holding a sty-ry, I had more gold than a pirate
They said it ain’t about stylin’, what they tryin’ to kick knowledge
Duffle Bag Boys, yea I can’t forget Dolla
In going to get the money, it’s some words that I follow
I swallow my pride, smoking endo outside
Straight from Collegrove, I’m reporting live

[Hook]
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
Yea, that my dog, that my dog uhh
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
That my dog, that my dog, that my dog
That my dog, yea that my dog........

[Intro: DJ Bigga Rankin]
Don't matter how far the road takes you
Nothing in this world can refresh your soul like being home
But a lot of niggas done sold they souls and made the wrong decision
So they can't come back home
So they try to find another source but it ain't nothing like love from the streets
I cherish these motherfuckin streets



[Intro]
I wouldn't even...
I wouldn't even be here without that mothafuckin' door
We doing numbers, holmes
5540, we doing numbers, holmes
You can look that shit up, you can research that shit

[Chorus]
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging

[Verse 1]
No doorbell, we had the cameras included
No hibachi, all we had is some tuna fish
Moved up a level, then I stepped up my grind
Got to the top, ain't nobody around
When I look down, all I see is some sucka shit
And I'ma run shit, I put that on my bucket list
Adidas streetball, all the foreigns with the straps
Before the dreadlocks, I had the cornrows to the back
Used to sit on a broke down Camaro with packs
Told her, "Turn around," even though she had his name tatted
That's the way that it was, had a way with the girls
Had a felony before you knew what a felony was
You was taking the shots, you was feeling the buzz
Got so much in the stash spot, I could fill up a bus
Got gorillas with us, got chinchillas with us
No pretenders with us, got the winners with us, yeah

[Chorus]
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging

[Verse 2]
Somebody watching the front door
Yeah I went to college and sold dope
Sold narcotics, a boat load
And all us felons and can't vote
Yeah I'm from the cut, I'm cutthroat
All up in the crowd, Frank Lucas fur coat
Yeah, sipping muddy like a mothafuckin' Merlot
Under the influence, I stayed on the first floor, first floor
Wait, first 48, hard to see my face, diamonds in the way
This is MMA, I just beat the case
In and out the hair salon, she got her nails polished
Turn up in tennis shoes, turn up in red bottoms
Turn up in red bottoms, turn up, turn up in red bottoms
She turn up in red bottoms, yeah what?
A nigga a hustler, now the feds got him
You bring the rubber bands, I bring the money counter

[Chorus]
Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Choppa kinda old, but a new clip
Shoot your ass, put yo ass on a news clip
Hope her two lips smell like tulips
Put you in the ground right next to the tulips
Nigga talkin' shit on the other side
Tell that pussy nigga I pull up
Used to sell work to his aunt, he ain't push weight
Nigga did pull ups
By the time ya look up, nigga done cook up
When you turn away, a nigga done took her
Got her in the suite, looking like a hooker
Jumpin' on the bed like Jimmy "Fly" Snuka
I take her to the mall and I pocketbook her
You tryna' spend time, nigga probably book her
Yeah, I'm tryna' fuck her, fuck her like I used to
I don't believe in karma, but I believe in Kama Sutra
Put one leg on the other leg
Then I skate away like Winnipeg
And I'm through fucking with these lame niggas
You a zero like a Easter egg
Got a lotta shooters in my repertoire
Got a dope spot called Escobar
Member when I used to play basketball
Now I'm out here playing ratchet ball, ooo!

[Hook: Future]
2 dollars a zip for some Actavis
Purple that Sprite in, then you pour it, you know we want it
Mollies and roxies you know we want it
Trap out that house with the doors open

Rims on my car got it bowlegged
Took your bitch back and got store credit
Still drinking Actavis, niggas is slackin'

Everything I do immaculate
House full of marble, no vacuuming
Charges consist of the trafficking
Trappin' I had the bitch bumpin' like Acne
Gettin' some head on the balcony

Walked in the store left my doors open
All my Rolls Royce got 4's on 'em

Uh, talkin' bout bruh let me hold some

Lookin' for a cup so I could pour some

Pocket full of money that's bluer than the sea

Drop the top off the whip, hair-line receding
High last night so I woke up this evening
Can't pimp me so don't you tip me
Rims on the car make it six feet
So I can park the car wherever the blimps be
I want a bird for my birthday, I drink syrup with no pancakes

When the beef is really on, ain’t no texting
Pull up real slow in a taxi
Gunshots turn em into athletes
I was hungry for a mil I gotta have it
Drove a couple couple cars up the mansion (Nah foreal at one time)
Smoked a whole seven sitting in the traffic
And niggas couldn't beat me if they practiced
Used to use my safe for a mattress
Used to use my mattress for a safe
See I could count a hundred thousand backwards (99, 98, 97.)
And I'm just tryna get it every day

Ain't nobody hollin' at you!

I had a dream that rap wouldn't work
I woke up on the block, had to hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork

So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold

Then we aim at your people
I be higher than a eagle
When I'm sipping on that codeine
Free my nigga Sigel
Ridin' on a jet, headin' to that Costa
Soon as I land I be in that Testarossa
If I die tonight, you gon' see some flexin' ghostas
I'm the man in my city, same thing in South Dakota
Man I'm running up that check, show you how I do it
I drink red bitches, I don't drink Red Bulls
Man they tried to give me wings, but I already had some
I'm all that and then some, my trap house is my income
And it's booming

[Hook]
I had a dream, rap wouldn't work
Woke up on the block, hit it with the fork

Climax! Make your main ho my side-chick
I'm so high, your whore get hijacked
And my vision is Pyrex
I do it big like a 5X
Killed they ass with the eyepatch
I got bad bitches on my side
I done fucked around and got sidetracked
My first night, I spent five stacks
Next night I forgot to count
I'm so hot; who gon' put the fire out?
I'm the fireman, I put fire out
Got a pole in my basement
Tipped your girl like Maliah now
Ridin' on these motherfucka's until they blow my tires out, uh

[Bridge]
My wrist deserve a shout-out, I'm like "What up, wrist?"
My stove deserve a shout-out, I'm like "What up, stove?"
All this jewelry on then I'm out cold
So much money on me, it won't even fold!

Been 'posed to stop drinkin'
Pocket full of Ben Franklins
Y'all niggas been hatin'
Balmain mixtape
Surround the booth with yellow tape
Zip the kush then meditate
Your ladder straight, you featherweight
You heavyweight, it's Saturday
Gladiator, tell your neighbor
Gun on table, Buick LeSabre
Do you now, do you later
Dice game, pool table
Two flavors, too anxious
Got to kill these niggas
I don't feel these niggas
Them some stealin' niggas
Them lil' bitty niggas
On Peter St. at my buildin'
Nigga, Keisha's daycare was half a million, nigga

[Hook]
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle

Fell off, came up
Fell off, came back up
Pulled a doolie in Magic parkin' lot
Came back up
Go to the door, don't get searched
Don't have to pay
Walk in, get ones, order wings
Nigga, this the A
AP, Hublot, Patek, Rollie, gold teeth
Niggas stealin' so much sauce
Them niggas damn near stole me
They stole the swag and they stole my license
You don't know about my sacrifices
Today I worked out on my triceps
Bought a room just to shoot dice in
Whip same color Cicely Tyson
Smokin' gas one of my original vices
Made a mil' off my phone devices
Listen to your own advices
I'm laid up, but I'm prayed up
You a handful, you a A cup
Might rock a jersey and a Jacob
Y'all young niggas need to wake up

[Hook]
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle

Yeah, I came from the mud
Came from the bottom
Spot 'em, I got 'em
I bought a bandana for 600 dollars
Mr. Miyagi
I like that pussy real soggy
I bought her noodles and sake
Favorite meal used to be chocolate
I used to stay with my cousins
Heat the house up with the oven
Airport tried to make us move without payin' us
We told 'em we ain't budgin'
We stole our cable from next door
It was still a finesse though
I'm still here, where the rest go?
This right here manifesto
I got some gold on my front tooth
And my hair grow like it's kudzu
Told her take a hike like hut two
I was raised by the Huxtables
I was raised in apartments
Right up under that yellow light
Right on top of that bando
Stand on the couch when I feel like, yeah!

[Hook]
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
Yeah, I'm ghetto, excuse me
Can't make no excuses
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
My life is a movie

[Verse 2]
I'm ghetto, excuse me
Please accept my apologies
This a biography
See through you niggas like radio-ology
Yeah, I'm ghetto, excuse me
I dip my bread in the Kool-Aid
My partner wrecked the new car
He only had that bitch two days
When you was rockin' the new Js
I was servin' some new Js
Went to the prom in a J car
He had just bought a new Mustang
Now I walked around with a digi scale
Paraphernalia in fingernails

[Hook]

Back on that crazy shit
Me and Ruth Chris, we got a relationship
Yeah I'm ghetto as fuck
I told 'em I got that strong
Tell 'em meet me up the street
For Christmas I want me a stove
For Christmas I want me a scale
For Christmas I want me some sandwich bags
If I go to the hospital
Better put rims on the ambulance
Better put lean in my IV
Nurse better have double Ds
Rest in peace to Double D
I'm from the ghetto, we a hundred deep

[Hook]
I'm ghetto, excuse me

Yeah, I'm ghetto, excuse me
Can't make no excuses
I'm ghetto, excuse me

[Outro]
You know, as kids we don't choose where we grow up at. You know, it's a living arrangement, it's a living situation. You know, but I'm thankful for everything that I've been through, for every seed that's been planted. You know, everything that grew on me. You dig what I'm sayin'? I come from that. I'm goin' this way, though. You dig what I'm sayin'? Yeah, straight up, a ghetto child, though, man. Super duper blessed, man, super duper blessed. Really anointed, anointed by the Lord so you know, I'm supposed to be here, you know what I'm sayin'? But excuse me, please, excuse me. I'm tryna go that way... that way

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I treat Goat like he was tata, dealin' up at Popeyes
In the fastlane, I move him over to the right side
Mac-11 life style, burrrt then I hop out
Dem burrrt, then it's lights out, I'm spazin' on you right now
Mama's only child, the crack house was my daycare
Being front to god, grey hair, see that's that old money
Kenmore stove money, packs on G rouge money
Ridin' down in that foreign whip the color of snow bunny
Pull up right to the beach and left the boat runnin'
So Sonny, you a comedian, all your flows funny
Dope funny, walk through the door, she like "Oh honey"
Plus I got a whip and a lock, they call me 4hunna
Tryna come clean off the spot, I'm talkin' detergent
Fuck her then answer my phone, I gotta leave urgent
Everythin' I did in the past was intellectual
Now it's Mr. Gimme-your-section-with-a-extra-booth
Show you what the extra do
Want a four door, so I bought me an extra coupe
One for me, one for me, really ain't no effort to it
Mr. Impeccable, turn you to a vegetable, fuck her on the sectional
Pull on her hair while she's lickin' on the testicles
Sixteen carefully, swag sold separately
Aimin' for the stars, so I fucked her on the balcony
Laid on the floor and I made your hoe come vacuum me

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
I'm on my Bobby Brown, babe
Put it on me tenderoni
And I got one of you in every town
To put it on me, I'm never lonely
Swimmin' in your hits, babe

Show out, show out, show out

[Bridge: The-Dream]

[Chorus: Quavo]
Good drank, big knots
Good drugs, I put a four on the rocks (lean!)

Put the dick in her rib cage
Whips out, Kunta Kinte
Diamonds clear like Bombay
Take your babies, no Harambe
Play with keys like Doc Dre

And your girl, call her, come through

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci! Huh (brr!) huh!

Well check this out my top in the trunk

Then check this out you’re poppin' the trunk
Three mil in a month
But I just did three years on a bunk
Oh, you in a slump
I'm headed to Oakland like  Kevin Da Runt
What is your point?
Square with the stamp, for Kevin Durant
Lay on on my trap
Play with my cap and I'll knock off your hat
I'm taking the cheese and killing the rats
Gucci Mane, call me the cat with the racks
I'm swervin', but I'm in back of the 'Bach
I'm Persian, man I got hoes from Iraq

He nervous, ain’t got no words for that
He hurt and want all of his purses back

She perfect and she got perky breasts
I just want some of that turkey neck
Trapper of the year, I'm from Bouldercrest
You snitch of the year cause you told the bis'

[Chorus: Quavo]
Good drank, big knots
Good drugs, I put a four on the rocks
Drop top, no hot box
12 tried to pull me over, pink slips to the cops

Who was real? Who was fake?
It was hard to keep it separate
And my bankroll big, this big, need Excedrin
And excessive marijuana in my motherfuckin' prison
We would wrap it like a present
We would act it like the preset
You was actin' like a peasant
I hold an eagle in the desert
With the Rollie and the bezel

Yeah I am so slick, bitch you better hit your hazards
And I bought a Versace plate just to eat my salad
And I can count money til I get a fuckin' callous

Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero
Walkin' like I got a kilo
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo, I'm walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero

[Verse 1]
I come in this bitch so fast, let me slow up on niggas
I fuckin' that bitch with the ass, and she hold up on niggas
You know that I'm drinkin', I pour up on niggas
My style, and just like I throw up on niggas
I don't fuck with niggas especially a ho nigga
VIP, I pour Moët on niggas, ayy
Triple beam to a digital scale, I got work in the mail
Clientele, I need a tractor trailer and a Ms Griselda
And I ain't into failure, and I don't even know what to tell you
I ain't got no work to sell you
I got hope to sell you, got me a boat to sail in
Ain't no joke like Rakim
Got the trap house rockin', you ain't get that shit
I got me a half, that's a split when I flip it
And whip it 'til I get me 36s
I get it, I got it, I'm slangin' narcotics
I sold dope in college, I'm semi psychotic
Might put the semi on niggas
Never keep bricks in mi casa

[Hook]
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo

Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero

[Verse 2]
I do this shit for the A
Y'all get the fuck out my way
I bought a car just to race it
I pass the car just to chase it
This is a standing ovation
The trap was my standin' location
Hit the strip club in the day shift
Give a lil' bitch a donation
Fresh to my bootlaces
I just beat me a few cases
I just told myself...
"Self, I need me a new bracelet"
Who the fakest? You the fakest
Lose or take it, rule to bacon, rude awaken
You forsaken, you replacement
Got me a jacuzzi in the basement
If it was a real nigga party
You couldn't get an invitation
You niggas is basic, you bitches is basic
I'm fuckin' two hoes in two different locations
You sittin' adjacent, you need a rotation
You need a quotation
Oh my medulla is mula
That pussy so close I can taste it

[Hook]
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero

[Verse 1]
Atlanta shit, I'm a fashion lover
Virgil Abloh did my first album cover

Nigga, I don't sleep, no NyQuil

I let Rico Wade hear my last album
Then them boys in the dungeon, ain't no band wagon
Man, I looked up to Dre, he my fuckin' favorite
And Yung Joc still owe me a lil' paper
Served Big Gipp and Cee-Lo, lethal
I was mobile, they was peephole, but we was equal
We were trappin', they were rappin'
That's why I fuck with Dolla, he was always snappin'
Started from apartments, ended in a mansion
That's the definition of growth and expansion
A slope and a ramp and a envelope full of hope
She gon' lick the stamp and I'm the main attraction
Lamborghini fast and I'm too tall for that shit
I tried to get in, I had to crawl in that bitch
But they 'bout to make a truck so I'ma call 'em
Ask 'em, "How many y'all gettin'? I want all of 'em"

[Chorus]
Lamborghini truck, Lamborghini truck

And I'm like the Snowman when I'm holdin' on a fork (skrrt)
And I'm like Dro when I'm rockin' Polo Sport
I feel like Gucci when I'm walkin' out of court
Rest in peace Lo, rest in peace Bankroll
One time for Rocko, Tip, and Roscoe
One of the top flows, on the top floor
Get it wholesale like Costco
You know I got that glow, Bruce LeRoy
As far as the rappers, I'm startin' to eat more
2 Chainz

[Chorus]
Lamborghini truck, Lamborghini truck

See I could wear black in the summertime
And I could wear white when its snowin'
I could show you where to go like a local
Order 20 bags out of Oakland

And use your girl for a chauffeur
I'm the realest nigga and the illest nigga
Fuck you lil nigga and your lil sister
Try to use a nigga when it's beneficial
Free all my niggas out the penitentiary

Cause the trap house don't got a swimming pool
Money piled up on the counter
Got a hundred round drum in the other counter
Got Ziploc bags and a digital scale and rubber bands all by the money counter
Got raid spray you know how the bugs be
Got a fan in the window by the love seat
And I know it was slow at work tonight
So bitch you better act like you love me

Told her to bring it here shawty
Told her to drop it there shawty
I'm from the belly of the beast

Now that my weed is so loud you can hear it down the street
Pull up 10 cars deep, you can't get rich off sleep

Had sex in a few places
Bedroom, living room
Bathroom, kid's room and the basement
Straight shot, no chaser
You'll always be my lil baby
Wanna know how your day been
Can't wait to go bare skin
Stretch you out by the bear rug
Give you hugs by the fireplace
Going down like the fire escape
Estate with the iron gates
All the diamonds got a ping on 'em
Living life like a king don't I
Walk around with your dream on me
Never front on your team homie
They say sex a weapon
Shit mine got a beam on it
My spinach got cream on it

[Verse 1]
I been on the road so long, I forgot what kind of cars I got
I rap so much I forgot what kind of bars I got
Rose in the concrete, grows to the top
Son of a gun, raised by a Glock
Georgia Power was  off  I was raised in the dark I don't know if it faze me or not
No telling
If I didn't turn 15 I wouldn't have been a felon (I bought it)
I bought the violence in my stick shift
If you don't shoot or get shot at you ain't go through adolescents
If you ain't go through all the pressure, You ain't get all of your blessings
What you know about not being able to re up going through depression
What you do about aggression, What you do about confession
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing

[Hook]
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing

[Verse 2]
Crunching numbers with [?] heads
7 figures in Buckhead
I get dough till its enough bread
Money tall so it's enough said
It was toom poom, Baby amp and big U stand for upset
I can tell you where the plug at he over there where my cuz at
Say I'm under the influence I was down stairs where the drugs at
40 cal, 50 cal, even my momma tote a pistol now
They call on that Crenshaw only thing we need is a mister child
You already know what this about, I shouldn't be riding around with this amount
Cause I can take your bitch with this amount
And take her on a trip with this amount
I look like a lick, act like I'm rich
Talk like a whip, walk like a brick
Fly like a blimp, right over the public
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing

[Hook]
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing
If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing

Got Chanel on her body

[Outro]
Thousand dollar shoes on your sofa
My other trap nigga watchin' Oprah
My other trap nigga watchin' Ricki Lake
I'm a trap nigga servin' shake and bake
I'm a trap nigga, serve you shake and bake
We in the back of the bando
Ammo like "Commando"
Pit bark in the front yard
Ain't no key for the top part
I'm allergic to cop cars
All these F's on my rims, fuck report cards
Reporting live straight from College Park



[Intro]
Sunbathing with a Rollie on, tan all on my tattoos
All my 16s cashews, V12 when I pass you
Reminiscing about the Motorollas
Weed stronger than a Coca-Cola
Wait up, bitch, hold up, hold up
You ain't there to hold the pole up

[Chorus]
OG kush diet, OG kush diet
OG kush diet, OG kush diet
My partna just died, my partna just died
Nothin' else to do but get high, fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm 'bout to pour out some liquor
I'm 'bout to pour out some lean
I got blue cheese in my jeans
I bought my queen Celine
I got my team Supreme
It ain't no in between
You either in or you out, I took a different route
I had to figure it out, I went to picking them out, you, you

[Refrain]
Fuck what you think, fuck what you think
Come to the bank, come through like Brinks
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house

[Verse 2]
Presidential prolly tickled, laughing 'bout who popped the pistol
That's the issue, just got a rental, just for instrumentals
I'ma keep the bitch 'til December
And park it on Broadway, away from the hallway
Away from the 'partments, away from the arcades
We don't play games with them boys
We bring the pain to them boys
I caught a plane with them boys
I taught the game to them boys
I am ashamed of them boys
Blame it on fame, blame it on whatever you wanna blame
I'm smart and insane, imagine a genius that don't have a brain
That live off of resources, that learned off of geek sources
I do play with 3 persons, I got it from researching
I'm fresher than detergent, I'm fresher than each person
I walk out and eat Church's, gig without rehearsing
Watch how I resurface, watch how I rework it, gas

[Chorus]
OG kush diet, OG kush diet
OG kush diet, OG kush diet
My partna just died, my partna just died
Nothin' else to do but get high, fuck

Fuck what you think, fuck what you think
Come to the bank, come through like Brinks
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house
I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house

[Verse 3]
Yeah, your favorite rapper's got no talent
Homeboy got coke habits
Used to drive a Porsche 'til I found out it was made by Volkswagen
This here is a toe tag 'em, Tity Boi gon' and toe tag 'em
Go ahead, hook they ass up to the tow truck
Let them know this a throat slashing
Your baby mama got no passion
Her best friend act old fashioned
Tell her take them panties off when she walk around my boat laughing
I'm V.I.P. at the yacht club, nigga you look like you not loved
Stars in my double R so clean I drive in white gloves
Sea bass with the white sauce, hopped out, get wiped off
Presence been felt everywhere
Except let me see, yeah the White House
Space age like 8 ball, MJG, Nate Dogg
Sippin' quavo, ridin' offsets, guess I'm 'bout to take off

[Chorus]
OG kush diet, OG kush diet
OG kush diet, OG kush diet
My partna just died, my partna just died
Nothin' else to do but get high, fuck

Fuck what you think, fuck what you think

[Hook]

[Bridge]



[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do
(My mama always said)
I said close your mouth and eat
You make some paper, then you make your own rules
(My mama always said, ayy, damn)
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do
I said close your mouth and eat
You make some paper, then you make your own rules

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm from the hood and it's evident
Used to sell drugs out my residence
Stayed in section 8 with relatives
Opportunity knockin', I let 'em in
I done put Forgis on everything
I left the mall like Ginobili
And if I'm not successful, ain't nobody gon' come console me
I pray my mama quit smokin'
When my dad died, I got focused
I gotta table full of Ace of Spades
I don't fuck around with you jokers (ooh)
Ain't heard a word from my old friends
Heard they wanna kick my doors in
I done loaded up the 2-2-3
I'm so high they might call a goaltend, yeah
Lord knows, stashed work in the console
So many autos in my garage, I can't open my car door
Bond on me like the sun on me
Gettin' this bread she say, "You dropped crumbs on me"
Walked in the club and got ones only
Need a tat on my stomach that say prawns only
Raised by single parent Black woman
They call me Tity Boi 'cause she used to spoil me
She always told me

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do
(My mama always said)
I said close your mouth and eat
You make some paper, then you make your own rules
(My mama always said, ayy, damn)
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do
I said close your mouth and eat
You make some paper, then you make your own rules

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Smoking on a yacht, call me Ricky Steamboat
Bags full of gas, used to serve them through the screen door
Tryna flip a brick, Shaq at the free throw
Taught by Scarface, Brad Jordan, Al Pacino, wooo
No rules, most of my partnas homeschooled
Most of my partnas got charges
And I ain't talking about no mothafuckin' dodges
Trappin' up outta the college
I'm addicted to the rice at Benihana
Raised by a single parent Black woman
They call me Tity Boi 'cause she used to spoil me
She always told me

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do
(Yeah)
I said close your mouth and eat
You make some paper, then you make your own rules
(My mama always said, ayy, damn)
Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do
I said close your mouth and eat
You make some paper, then you make your own rules

[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, do it for the hood, nigga, rep

I'm just tryna make my mama proud, uh
I ain't fuckin' 'round with you (uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
T.R.U. University, I pull it up and murk a beat
Mama house was filled up with bags of Hercules (strong)
Soon as I finished pissin', I put the seat down
Or my mama'd be cussin' my damn ass out
Only child, no siblings, no besties
I couldn't do nothin' right like a lefty (woo)
Bought my mama's first house with the juug money (alright)
Bought my mama's second house with the club money (show)
Me and mama used to trap out the same house (same house)
Used to eat and go to sleep on the same couch (same couch)
Me and mama got busted at the same time (same time)
Went to court and told judge the damn same lies (same lies)
I can tell mama proud of her only son
2 Chainz, I have always worn more than one

4Hunnid! My mama ain't raise no ho (no ho)
'Cause my mama ain't no ho (no ho)
My mama ain't raise no ho (no ho)
Drop a pin and in ten we at your door, nigga
Ho bitches gettin' fucked on the floor
They cold-hearted so you gotta do 'em cold
These hoes and my mama can't get along (why?)
'Cause my mama ain't no ho
I was runnin' up a check with the homies on the disk
I was fuckin' up the pork, I ain't ever do the feds
Got some YGs from the gang, they'll do you for a check
And you know I'm gang gang 'cause that's the only thing I rep
Ayy, mama
When I leave the house it's for them dollars
You are the reason I bought that choppa
'Cause I know you wanna see me come home proper
Soon as I get right I said I gotcha then I gotcha
4Hunnid!

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]

Mama taught me how to get that bankroll (mama)
Yeah, vault up in my loft in case the bank closed (vault, yeah)
Mama ain't have it all, we wore the same clothes (have it all)
I kicked the door, I kicked the door, I risked it all for dough (kicked the door)
I found that .44, it turned me to an animal (4, 4)
Got that wide load, niggas wasn't even compatible (wide load)
Choppa firin', it soundin' just like a rattle lure
.223 caliber, you ain't in my caliber (oh, oh)
Mama told me pray 'cause they'll keep givin' me these bucks (bucks)
Sit on that G6, I'm flyin' high, Aladdin on the rug (mama)
I put Goyard on my mama (Goyard)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm gonna cause pandemonium
Pick up the paper, custodian
This how Prince met Apollonia
Tryna fill up California kings
Hydrocodeine with the Visine
Master bedroom on the right wing
This a Philippe not a Breitling
Fuck her to sleep, she had pipe dreams
Yeah, this is the king of the trap
Yeah, I pull it straight out the hat
Yeah, everyone better take cover
Yeah, got rappers under attack
Uh, my daughters inherit arrogance
And they intelligent, that's a fact
Bought me a car February 1st
You already know it was black on black
I cover my scars with the tats on tats
You better back back, rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
I pass you a joint, better pass it back
I went to Montgomery, with packs on back
Sent her to the store for some plastic bags
Sent her to the store for some rubber bands
I started pitching so easy
I throw the work to you underhand
Underworld, underground, underline
I'm underdog and you under mine
This here ain't no once upon a time
This really happened for real
Can't even trust our own government
Aw man fuck all that humble shit
Mumbling
Man fuck all that mumble shit

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Realize
A lot of these niggas tell real lies
They not about shit in real life
And thats something that I had to realize (Realize)
I had to reco-reco-recogni-i-ize it
(reco-reco-recogni-i-ize)
They see me winning and now they dont liiike it
(Yeah, I know they dont like it)
Act like the love me, but hate me in pri-i-vate
I had to reco-reco-recogni-i-ize it

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo
I went and copped a ring
I call this rock, Dwayne
Johnson, stop the playin'
Man, I cannot complain
I left my shades in Atlanta so I told my pilot to stop the plane
He bust a U in the air
She say she doin' it, where?
She wanna sit in my chair
But she could never be my heir
Checks, clear, Bible, swear
They ain't buggin', I go off
Asahd Khaled with the cloth
Dwayne Carter of the north
Dwayne Wade in the fourth
New dream house for mommy
Keep 'Caiah in Armani
Putting my nieces through college
This for Kellise and Imani
Look at these niggas I put on
All of these niggas I'm good on
My own two, what I stood on
That's why their necks what I'm keepin' my foot on
I've been winning 8 years consistently, at least respect it
Papoose wrote a Ether record
But I broke Aretha record
See this is chess, not checkers
You can not check the checkers
Did Nas clear that "Ether" record?
Nah, but I broke Aretha record

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Realize
A lot of these niggas tell real lies
They not about shit in real life
And thats something that I had to realize (Realize)
I had to reco-reco-recogni-i-ize it
(reco-reco-recogn-i-ize)
They see me winning and now they dont liiike it
(Yeah, I know they dont like it)
Act like the love me, but hate me in pri-i-vate
I had to reco-reco-recogn-i-ize it



[Intro]
Yeaaaah, turn that maafaka up NOLAN. Woah, know what I'm saying, I wanna feel like I was in some muthafakin' danger. I got my mothafuckin' pistol in my pocket, ya dig? Yeah, in the booth, on some 5540 old national shit, you know what it is, nigga. We in the back, nigga, way in the back, nigga, serving sacks, nigga and serving Act. Mane, c'mon with the Kap, bruh. AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

[Chorus]
Riverdale, he was there, she was there, you wasn't there
I was the same ol' nigga
Yeah that trap had raised a nigga
How could you blame a nigga?
Gold everywhere, gold over there, Trinidad James you niggas
Came on the set with hundreds to bet
But I still changed you niggas, yeah

[Verse 1]
My first foreign car, it was a Bimmer
My second foreign car, it was a Bimmer
My third foreign car, it was a Porsche
My fourth foreign car you can't afford
My pocket pregnant, don't want no abortion
My draws got them horses, my car got them horses
Rocking some Pradas like they was Air Forces
We had no choices

[Chorus]
Riverdale, he was there, she was there, you wasn't there
I was the same ol' nigga
Yeah that trap had raised a nigga
How could you blame a nigga?
Gold everywhere, gold over there, Trinidad James you niggas
Came on the set with hundreds to bet
But I still changed you niggas, yeah

[Verse 2]
You wasn't there when mama was struggling
You wasn't there when mama was fussing
Told 'em ketchup, you too far in the mustard
I had a Chevelle and wanted a Cutlass
I went to work and I made an abundance
Gucci flip flops with the corns and bunions
Counting blue hundreds and smoking an onion
And she got an onion and I wanna rub it
We hanging off the Nat, see that's where my office at
We dressed all in black
We got 'em calling back, just went to the mall and back
When you was the quarterback, I had the quarter sacks

[Pre-Chorus]
Riverdale, Riverdale, Riverdale, Riverdale, Riverdale
Riverdale Rd., nigga
He was there, he was there, you weren't there
He was there, she was there
Riverdale Rd., nigga
Abracadabra, I turned myself into a millionaire
I wore some Gucci to your mama house just to leave it there

[Chorus]
Riverdale, he was there, she was there, you wasn't there
I was the same ol' nigga
Yeah that trap had raised a nigga
How could you blame a nigga?
Gold everywhere, gold over there, Trinidad James you niggas
Came on the set with hundreds to bet
But I still changed you niggas, yeah

[Bridge]
I know something you don't know
I'm gonna get some bands, yeah
I know something you don't know, yeah
I'm gonna get some bands

[Verse 3]
Okay, from grams to Grammys
Okay, from fans to family
I went from trips we tryna plan
To cribs in South Miami
They got my vision fancy
My trigger finger antsy
I told the bitch she got to sit down
Just to understand me
They asking, "What's the plan, B?"
I don't have a Plan B
I told 'em this shit got to work
It's just like candy to me
I mean it's hard but it's sweet
I'm Drench God in the streets
I break the law in the sheets
I make her cum on repeat

[Outro]
I know something you don't know
I'm gonna get some bands, oh yeah
I know something you don't know, yeah
I'm gonna get some bands
Riverdale, Riverdale!



[Intro]
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah

Who else gon' believe in you? Who else gon' believe in you?
Believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you?
Who else gon' believe in you, who else gon' believe in you?

[Verse 1]
Believe in yourself, health is wealth
Gotta get mine, faster than a step
I can make a hundred thousand just sitting by the steps
I can count a hundred thousand with my feet in the chair
I can pull the baddest broad in here
With my hand pulled behind my back
One hand on the steering wheel
2 Chainz with the ponytail, got the bodyguard concealed
Ill meaning of sickness, I use the pharmacy as a witness
I mean anything around me that's against us, they can't be
I got God on my side, that's all I need to ride
See that's all I need to vibe, asking what I do tonight
That's really none of your business, unless you wanna get in this

[Chorus]
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way

Oh man, look at me now
Used to have a killer crossover

So many chains on I give you the cold shoulder
So many chains on, I tell 'em move over
Big shit over here, boy
100 acres on my property, man I might hit a deer, boy

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I sip drank with my dinner, smoke some gas before breakfast
Bitches know my name and I don’t have to wear a necklace (2 Chainz)
Bought a Wraith for Winter and a vert for the Summer
'Member twelfth grade I sold some work to undercover
Mama only child we stayed in a one bedroom (tru)
Used to ride MARTA ‘cause it had more leg room
I'm a ghetto boy, I came up on Brad Jordan
First lick I made, I bought five pairs of Jordans
Make it so bad, two pair were the same
I see the old me in new cats in the game
Drop some loose change on some clothes I can't pronounce
Gun so muhfuckin' big you gotta crouch
I like pretty girls with some business about theyself
Bring your best friend, you don't need nobody else
All about that mula, Netflix, and the Moscato
In my sex drive, I ride over potholes

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I just got a text message from wifey, nigga
I scroll down, the next message from Nike, nigga
I’m just doing it too big on these tiny niggas
I been lost my fuckin’ mind, I never mind these niggas
Pockets deep and I’mma get in depth like like Johnny nigga
Acting like they on the edge, I’m a step behind these niggas
Outthink, outshine these niggas
Eyes chink like Chinese niggas
Fast lane, fast life, you blink you probably miss us
You thinking 'bout your missus
I'm thinking about my missions
We think you outchea snitching, that’s why we ‘round here whispering
I think my palms are itching, I think my bomb is ticking
I keep that Maggie on me, I think I'm Homer Simpson
Money over bitches, should be a Bible scripture
Bitches, hoes, and women, I don’t know the difference
All I know is this shit, I don’t owe them bitches
I do me and love it, Lord I done overdid it

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
All I know is this shit, I don’t owe them bitches
I do me and love it, I done overdid it
I don’t owe them niggas, I don’t owe them niggas
I do me and love it, I done overdid it



[Intro]
Y'all niggas lame for that, y'all niggas lame for that
Shoot a man in his back, should be ashamed of that
Young niggas banging back, young nigga banging back
Then we gon' fade to black then we gon' fade to black

[Verse 1]
I left the crib walking, drove a Mercedes back
You wasn't blessed with ambition so who you gon blame for that
Tried to get off the Act, still didn't know how to act
Still pull up in the back, sit my ass right in the back
Tell my driver when he open my door to take off his hat
Double saran everything so that you know its a wrap
Double salute anybody that made it out the trap
Some of y'all probably still owe me from back
In the back in the back in the back in the back
I had that work right in front of me fuck all you niggas you wannabes
Most of you niggas is under mes, I'ma give ya ass some to see
My car don't have car keys, my crib got palm trees
Pussy smell like sardine you, need to get up of my lawn please
This a real nigga conversation, real nigga demonstration real niggas
No Cristal or Hilfigers, a bunch of ignorant lil' niggas
A bunch of red young tenders, dark skin queens, Puerto Rican princess's
Scratch my hand my palms itching, hit the dope start twitching
This a new kinda kitchen, marble countertops, see through fridge
3 thousand for the microwave, touchscreen stove lil biiiiitch!!
Please don't make me relapse, make me start back trappin
Everybody in the city, saying that boy Tity done started back snapping

[Chorus]
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
Tell her let's go have a bite, tell her let's go have a bite
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
Treat every night like it's Saturday night, like it's Saturday night, yeah

[Verse 2]
I sat in the trap no one cooked at night, I treat my third strike like its Kryptonite
I stopped serving sacks over qualified, have you ever seen a homicide?
Have you ever seen ya partna die? Have you ever been traumatized
Even at graduation i had a bookbag full of yams, tryna multiply
Enough of the negative actions, I got my paycheck off passion
I'm wearing 4 bracelets for fashion, don't think its a race when I pass you
Stop talking that mafia shit, you never met Meech, J-bo or Illz
Luda charged me just to dip, was there when Chaka was swung on by Tip
I'm like oh shit we goon tear up this bitch, pull out a stick when u put up your fist
I'm like these niggas done fucked up my fit, funny how heaven and hell co exist
Funny how life can put you in the mix, I sold the pounds and go hustle the bricks
I booked studio with the trap money, Lil Wayne used to come get the bags from me
You still asking niggas for gas money, I look at these rappers like crash dummies
I look at these bitches that fuck with these rappers like bitch you just fucked with my last homie
Kesha can come get the last from me, Heaven can come get the last from me
Harmony can come get the last from me, Halo can come get the last from me MAMA!

[Chorus]
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
Tell her let's go have a bite, tell her let's go have a bite
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
Treat every night like it's Saturday night, like it's Saturday night, yeah

You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hard work beats talent
Dope boy meets Khaled
Don P and eat salad
Walking around, my feet Bally
Sisquo and St. Ives
Six guns, eight knives
Potato on the barrel of it
Make you niggas hate fries
Been poppin' wheelies since 14
Sleeping with them, in them since 14
Ready to take one for the team
Ain't no discount, if ain't the one, we got a miscount
I am the truth, lil' nigga, shooting bullets from the booth, lil' nigga
BOOM

[Chorus]
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You too concerned with others
This for the single mothers
Might have a millionaire
Moving through Riverdale
Jacket on Rick Flair
Watch on Rick Flair
James Brown with the slick hair
Watch how she dance on it, dance on the work
If the pussy squirt, put her name in a verse
I am so high, I'm scared to jump
Keep the gas on me, I'm prepared to pump, alright

[Chorus]
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah



[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Here I go, here I go this that C5
Bitch I’m back, with that crack like panty lines
Asinine, I get blow like dandelions
Fuck more hoes than advertised
They say Tune you’re dead wrong
I say wrong, had to die
Pussy nigga don’t keep it real no more
Drug dealers changed but the high stay the same
Prices go up but the high stay the same
Gotta watch for undercovers like crying in the rain
Chillin’ in the crib with the lock on the door
Layin’ on the couch with the Glock on the floor
Within arm reach, security, alarm breach
I just cut off the lights, hope I don’t shoot my hoe
I eat so much shrimp, I smoke so much hemp
The world too small it feel like 4 walls
You see I got holes punched in
My chances are cold cut thin, but I still took ‘em and nigga we made it
T roll that killer, weed up in the swisher, and make it as fat as a pig in a blanket
My BFF is Benjamin Franklin, they cry for help we get ‘em a hanky
Ain’t nothing sweet but the shit that we drinkin’, the bitches we bangin’, the cinnamon danish
The penalty's pending, shit is restraining
It is a shame but niggas is shameless
Niggas is assholes, or enemas, finna get anal
Injury, time out, I just blew my mind out
But still I’m maintaining
Real gangsta shit it get dangerous
You talking money and guns, 2 languages
I throw niggas from off of the plane I’m in
Oh my god, it’s raining men
Said the weatherman to the anchorman
I send hella cash to the bank I’m with
What you do it for if it ain’t for this
I watch my step so much, I’m starting to feel like my ankles’ wrist
Cold hearted, starting to feel like I’m in Anchorage when I think of this
And rude awakenings get taken in like fragrances

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Bitch I smell like money, dope man cologne
I say bitch I smell like money, that’s that dope man cologne
And if he ain’t getting money, don’t love him, leave his broke ass alone
I say if he ain’t getting money, leave his stank ass alone
‘Cause bitch I smell like money, I smell like money
When you this rich they call it wealthy
Shit they gotta call it somethin’
Lord I done got too rich for stuntin’ (damn)
But not for thuggin.’
That’s right bitch I smell like money, money
You smell me coming

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz
Totin’ double barrels in a horse and carriage
Ain’t scared of nothing except God and marriage
Through the concrete grew a rose petal
If trapping was a sport, I’d have a gold medal
I steal her like Jerome Bettis
Call me Trill Cosby, I might spike my own beverage
Parallel park in front of Neiman Marcus
He ain’t never fly nigga, like an ostrich
They say ain’t nothing for free, but please free my partnas
Might have a swag contest and give out free Versaces
Yea, lobster rolls for an appetizer
Bad red bitch give me a lap-etizer
I’m in my Rolls Royce because it’s black and wiser
And don’t get in the way, my nig this rapid fire
Brrr stick ‘em, I’m a victim of being a victim
Codeines, Xanax and liquor
Prescriptions and couple pistols
Got clean molly with the crystals
Middle finger to the judicials
Fork and a pot is my utensils
Had a threesome with 2 sisters
I get head and you kiss her
I don’t never call and you miss her
I got every gun except a missile
I paid attention to the minister
My silhouette is sinister
Only child with trust issues
You couldn’t walk a mile in my hoop shoes
Me and Tune 2 loose screws
2 parts in my box cut, my pop wouldn’t even pop up
Last night I prayed to God and asked for him to make a drop truck
Polo T and ice watch, moccasins without socks
And I smell like money, I can count a hundred thousand with the lights off

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I say bitch I smell like money, that’s that dope and cologne
And if he ain’t getting money, don’t love him, leave his broke ass alone
I say if he ain’t getting money, leave his stank ass alone
‘Cause bitch I smell like money



[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Interlude: 2 Chainz]
I am smoking on exotic, my girl ain't got no stomach
Every time we have sex she always ask me for a hundred
I ask her is she working, she ask me do I want it
I say when I went to school bitch money was the subject

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around on my side of town, boxing gloves I beat the trial
I had the coke I had a smile, I had a coat for every style
Crocodile the gator type, I'm allergic to the hater type
I take ya wife, give her back, 9 months after that, SIMILAC!
Similar the saying, mama's baby daddy's maybe
When we had sex I was in a Mercedes
And I ain't crazy, but if that's my baby
Then we gonna have to name the little baby Mercedes
The money that I'm making I don't see you like I'm blind
I'd rather spend money baby I don't spend time
My pockets on full, and so is my gas tank
And all my cars got gas in the ashtray

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm riding around on my side of town wit' my dubs up and my window down
It's the king homie I'm on one, them suckers know they don't want none
Steady repping that one son, Bankhead, Cedar Hills
I'm on Simpson Road and I'm going over to pick up some dough from in Adamsville
My seat white, my paint tight, spray candy red the same at the wheel
Got a bag of pills in my stash spot, steady whipping them racks out
Got a quarter-mil in my Louis bag if you wanna know what that sack 'bout
Still rep for them have-nots, try me homie you assed out
I got Striver's Row in my denim tag and Akoo shit, new kicks
Supersport on deuces, bumping that Trap Muzik
I'm super-paid, I'm Gucci, 2 cute chicks who do tricks
Stay out of my business, when I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it

Come on, come on, come on

I am in rare form, I had to get it on
You never feed me, I use my own seasoning
Autograph cleavage, how many girls believe you?
How many girls you tried, I know a girl you lied to
She wants your ass to die, I look you dead in your eye
It’s real nigga season, it’s right after Easter
Might buy me a Regal, put that on my Visa
I need me some singles, don’t care if you’re single
Take you and mingle, take you to Neiman’s
We hit the bars tonight, look at the roof on the Wraith
It look like the stars at night, yeah

Go to the dealership, fishtail off the lot
You know I'm comin' straight out the block
You know I'm comin' straight out the top
Shawty said she want 5 million
'Cause I told her to leave and call her a thot
Shit, you can like it or not, damn

Look at the watch on my wrist

Nigga watch the assist (swish)
I run the trap like the marathon
You niggas softer than silicone
You know what it's like when the feelin' gone

Turn the White House to the Terror Dome
I used to serve at the Chevron
I used to serve with my necklace on, bitch

Damn, girl, what happened?, what happened?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She said ''oh, you got that comeback'', she said my dick is a necessity
Drop my drawers, and pull out my longevity
She just hop on it, and then she forget everything
Oh she so open, who’s obsessed with me, when she leave me, she come back like she ain’t never leave
She talk bad about my new bitch, cause we got chemistry
She said ''it ain't jealousy'', allegedly
I thought you weren’t fucking with me no more
Girl, what happened?, you act like you don’t miss me , oh my god you suck at acting
I am like I thought you don’t fuck with me no more, girl I’m laughing
She said, she get real, when that vibrator out of batteries
She be talking about how she moving on with her life, she tired of my shit and she can do better
She told herself; she ain’t fucking with me no more
She lied to herself, she'll lie to who whatever
Talking about, she seen me with such and such
I say it’s nothin', just fuck and duck
She said ''yeah, right, nigga, what I look like?''
I said ''just like my next daughter or somethin'
So she said ''ohh, you make me sick
I love you, I hate you, I’m leaving, I’m lying
Cause none of them niggas, can never be you, they can never be you, the  "o" nor the "Y"
If she’s over me, I look up to the sky, I see her falling for me like a bomb
She said ''I know you'll miss me when I’m gone''
I just co­sign and we make up for lost time

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
She always say , this is the last time
(She always say , this is the last time)

Quit lying to yourself, retrace all ya steps
Fucking with them suckers, they gonna have ya playing with yaself
I’m a smooth operator; you don’t need a vibrator
Licking everything below, the navel, cause I’m able
Ball so muhfuckin' hard, tape my ankle
Ball so muhfuckin' hard , check my bankroll
First talkin' bout you don't fuck with a nigga, go outta town like you done with a nigga
Really ain't much, she ain't done with a nigga
Shots, straight liquor, make a nigga wanna lick it
I put the ''ex'' in the exceptional, put the ''ex'' in the extra­ho
I put the ''X'' in X and O
I got the game in professional, yeah
My dick is the antidote

Yo' lying ass, codeine in my wine glass

I get high and I fly past, I don't know nothing 'bout iChat
I'm working this iPhone, they need an app called iTrap
I trap, shining like a night lamp
I just hit my girlfriend and asked her where her wife at
White cup, white hat, laying on a white couch
Got that presidential in a residential white house
Nigga saying "who?" (who) like a white owl
You can see me shinin' (shinin') with the light out, come on

Turn five to a ten to a twenty to fifty
To hundred, my niggas get money, I want it
Ride through the city, my niggas got choppers

Everything on me, I shine like a trophy
Run up a check while they watch out for police
Versace my pinky, a brick on my Rollie
That Cali Ferrari, I'm feeling like Kobe
T-R-U, that's to the death of me, nigga
Killers on the right and left of me, nigga
My destiny, nigga, to get all this money
I can't, I can't share that whole recipe with ya
My nigga told me "Get 'em, get it?" I got 'em
Stand on that couch and just drink out the bottle
That .40 got hollows, that bitch, she gon' swallow
Get to that money, I'm King of Chicago
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in
Bought that Benz just to fuck your friends
Giuseppe's 900 with the gold bars
Everything about me raw like a dope charge

We might come in there and take, all the hoes
Like I could rob, like, everybody there

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
That Chanel shit, I like that
Got your own ride, I like that
Got your mind right, I like that
In a fantasy world, I'd wife that
At the blue flame with 2 chains on
8 rings on, maintain home
Got pulled over on the way home
Used to make juugs off the payphone
Left mama's crib with a thousand Nikes
Niggas know I had a thousand wifeys
Hood nigga, had a thousand vices
Hit Benihanas for a thousand rices
Garlic butter with the yum yum
You know the south side where I come from
Hit the dealership with a lump sum
Make her pump the gas with her pumps on
With some pom poms, that's Don Juan
Don Julio, trap house needs cuticles
Trap house need a studio
Trap house need a new sofa
These young niggas keep fuckin' on it
I do this shit so big I can get Puffy on it

[Hook: YFN Lucci]
I can tell you in love with her
Tell you in love with her
Yeah you can tell I'm just fuckin' her

Steady cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her
Yeah you be cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her

She undeniable underneath me
She told me that I can take the pussy

[Intro: 50 Cent]
I just want to chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions
And they all about us



[Intro]
Fifty, fifty
Fifty, fifty
Fifty, fifty
Ferrari, Ferrari
Ferrari, Ferrari
Ferrari, Ferrari
Shooter, shooter
Shooter, shooter

[Verse]
I was innocent then, I ain’t do no wrong
She said, “you mommy little man,” I said, “yep, uh huh”
She was everything to me, when she came, I just lit up
Sunday morning I was so sharp, all did up
It was welfare or hustlin', they killed her for that
The first shot, bullet wound in my back
I’m fucked up, look at my sneakers, I’m fucked up
Now I’m on my own, mommy gone
Sam said, “you a young boy, why your clothes look so old?
You don’t need fish, little nigga, you need a pole
You need no new kicks, you need an O”
Chop that, bag it, get right back at it
That touched me, it hit me in my heart
I’m a hustler, homie, you was giving me my start
I am what I am, Sabrina’s only baby
Practicing in the mirror, pulling out my .380
Oh man, I fucked up nana gonna kill me
Whenever shit can go wrong it always will, see
Seven grams of cocaine, three grams of dope
Saint Mary medallion hanging from my rope
Try to punk me and my gun smoke
Look, I’m outta control, my gun go
Off like it’s legal, call the cops, you need to
Give ‘em my description, I ain’t bullshittin'
My high school sweetheart love didn’t last long
Niggas start flashing that bread and she was gone
That hurt me like the bullet in my calf then
My next girl was a pain in the ass
I got two shots left, in case niggas try to get me
That’s nine shots, we just call it Fifty

[Outro]
Mama said the Lord gon’ bless us
Mama said, mama said
Mama said the Lord gon’ bless us
Then in came the landlord, beef, and the stresses
Mama said the Lord gon’ bless us
Mama said, mama said
Mama said the Lord gon’ bless us
The dope bought the shit the food stamps couldn’t get us
Mama said the Lord gon’ bless us
That’s what mama said, that's what mama said



[Produced by Jake One]

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Now if I give you all of me, what'chu gonna give me back?
Your body is calling me, got me feeling like a fiend on crack
Boy you gonna make me fall in love, now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me, tell me what'chu gon' give me back?

[Verse 1]
Let's start with the moon and the stars, whatever you into
The money I acquire, mama, make it all simple
Flashback '03, paparazzi flashing flicks
I moved away, hustle hard, now I got a sick stash
Tell me you miss me, baby come here and kiss me
Mwah - it just happened so quickly
Feels like I hopped off a bus and got in a Bentley
It's gangsta my music, even when it's the smooth shit
You can hate me cause I hurt you, but I ain't mean to do it
Em predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it
He said women from Hollywood, they liar-liar-liars
You fuck 'em they, get you heated, deny you like Mariah
Fast forward to '06, I'm still on fire
The world is still turning, my records are still earning
Dough come quicker and quicker, flow gets sicker and sicker
Straight up and down, baby, I'm a special kind of nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Life is short, baby, be a part of my dreams
I own Ferrari horses, my Lamborghini leans
So mean, I have niggas hating on me
God gave me a gift, I'm supposed to be rich
I'm supposed to ride through the hood and make niggas sick
When my homies put in work, they supposed to get hit
With a piece of chain thick and go and buy 'em some bricks
I ain't make that up, this is how it's 'sposed to be kid
You should feel like a lifer that get back that time
When I smile your smile should be as big as mines
Girl to know me is to love me, I'm one of a kind
Even when you hate me you love me, forever you're mine

[Hook]

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
What you gonna give me back?
You're gonna make me fall in love
What you gon' give me, what you gon' give me, what you gon' give me



[Produced by Dangerous LLC]

[Hook]
Shorty, you ain't gotta take your panties off, just pull 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster baby come on and ride
It go up and down and round and round, stand up or get on the floor
It's on tonight, I know what you like, I know just how to break you off

[Verse 1]
Good evening ladies, I'll tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
There's lots of activities, fun things to do
And I'll find my pleasure in pleasing you
Some rides go fast, some rides go slow
You fear heights when I'm high, hell yeah I'll go low
It tastes so sweet that sticky cotton candy
We get carried away, we be starting a family
It's a perfect time for a magic trick
Girl, you know it's no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat
Applause now, that's the first half of my act
I started out a pimp, now I'm more like a mac
I don't need your paper, just don't fuck with my stacks
(Oh, it's like that?) Yeah, it's like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now you can ride the horse around the carousel
Explosions, Trojans, all in the hotel
Put me to the test, girl, I don't fail
I work it out without a doubt
There's plenty water rides, I'm sure to get you wet in the park
Have your lusting seductions considered an art
Throw a hoop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like, you know I don't care
I really wanna thank ya for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak, but I'm being sincere
And your pass is valid all summer, my dear
So at your convenience you can always return
There's so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that, lick that, swallow that lollipop
Forget that grip, that ride it nonstop

[Hook]

The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see, just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking, all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype, and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you
Let's get it poppin', shawty, we could switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
(Let me talk to you)

[Intro]
Yeah! It's my tape man, listen to my tape
(I've waited I've waited, time went by
What I'll do is cry silly, silly)

[Hook]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend,
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time

Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 1]
First we get to talkin, then we get to touchin
If we get past the phone games we'll be fuckin
I kiss like the french do, I put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly

[Hook]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)

Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine
(Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 2]
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
That's the swagger you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

[Hook]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)

(Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time

You said that I could call you whenever I needed someone to listen to me

Glad you took your time and now I'm satisfied that's why I want you all to me

Cause if you were my best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me baby)
Can I be your best friend, I promise boy you'll be mine
(Oooh baby be mine)
I said he's just a friend, baby it's not pretend
Either he is or he ain't my man, I said he's just a friend

[50 Cent]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine
(Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate, come on

[Verse 4: Olivia]
I'm not afraid to explore my body - oooh, gimme that feelin
Now we can watch some TV or play a CD; baby that sexual healin'
You tried to sing to me; you're never on the key, but you do it just to appease me
I rather spend my time wastin' time with you; oooh wee you make it so easy

[Hook: Olivia]
Cause if you were my best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round all the time)
Can I be your best friend, I promise boy you will be mine
(Please baby be mine yeah!)
I said he's just a friend (Oh Oooh!)
Baby it's not pretend (No baby)
Either he is or he ain't my man, I said he's just a friend

[Bridge: Olivia]
We been better than friends, for a long time
Ain't no need to pretend, you'll always be mine
We been better than friends, for a long time
Ain't no need to pretend, you'll always be mine

[Hook: 50 Cent]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time

Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine
(Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend



[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, uh huh
So seductive

[Hook: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature rising, okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle
I break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasing you about how sprung I got you
When you show me what you working, baby, no problem
Get on top, get your bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm trying to explain, baby, the best way I can
I melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (uh huh)

[Hook: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa

[Bridge: 50 Cent & Olivia]
Girl, what we do, what we do
And where we do, and where we do
The things we do, things we do
Are just between me and you, yeah, oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
‘Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She kept pulling on my zipper
It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Dripping wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gonna sip that heavy bubble, man, every bottle is gone

[Hook: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa

[Hook: x2]
Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
They say he couldn't do it, look, now, I did it
I topped 'In the Club', I'm still sipping the bub
The drama, I'm with it, I get biz, you get it
I breezed on that shiddit, I split your widdig
That's why a nigga's bidded, I can't forget it
I said I didn't do it, witnesses said I did it
I'm fresh out on bail, my Benz is all kitted
Five TV's, my rims is so sidick
I cruise through, your bitch just fell in love with it
Baby, come in, girl, I want to give it to you
Once I'm in, it's on, I'm a freak with it
Money comes with it, hot shit, I spit it
G Unit kidicks, blue New York fitted
Shorty, want to cut, oh, yeah, I'm with it
She comes to my hotel room, she know she's gone get it
Its exercise, my homie, he's been waiting, he's next in line

[Hook]

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
People always talking about my reputation
I don't love them, I don't need them
I don't love them, I don't need them
I don't love them
I don't care what she do with him, it's all good with me

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
They can't do it how I do it, I'm number one, I knew it
I do, I do my thing and gangsters bop to it
It's hit after hit, damn, I'm on a roll
I'm like James Brown now, man, I've got soul
No, I ain't pimping, hell, yeah, I've got hoes
I was born to do this, when I breathe I make a killing
Think I'm bullshitting, my money's touching the ceiling
Ain't buying condos, I'm buying the whole building
I'm pissing on grown women, R Kelly do it to children
You bet against me, boy, I'mma hurt your feelings
Because over and over, I'mma keep on winning
My Rolls Royce's tinted, your Phantom's rented
That's why we never ever ever ever see you with it
Man, everybody knows, like everywhere I go
When 50 in the club, shit just goes out of control
You can blame it on Em, or blame it on Dre, okay?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I gave her books to read, fed her mind with knowledge
Gave her street smarts, shit you can't get in college
She's a reflection of me so you know she the shit
If I'm a star she a star, if I'm rich she rich
That's my dog
I tell her stay she wanna go, I tell her go she wanna stay
That's my dog
You know a bitch don't usually mean nothing to me, that's right
But that's my dog I go left, she go right, I go up, she go down
She couldn't listen that, she ain't around
So ungrateful screaming ''I hate you''
She must got amnesia, bitch I made you
Now just think, just think that could've been you
Just think, that should've been you
Yeah, with me, I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider so I ain't fucking with you

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, go
The reason you didn't get dick
Because you got your nose up your ass like your smelling your shit
But tonight you met your match
Cause I be smelling my shit too, now how you like that?
You could've had this dude and anything you choose
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fucking with ya
(Could've been you)
Shopping spree's, drop top hair blowing in the wind
(Could've been you)
Living lavish, instead it's your girlfriend
But you tripping while we sipping
In the back of the club big tipping

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
She say it hurts when you supposed to win then you lose
You were supposed to be sure, baby, you was confused
I had a thing for you, I had a ring for you
House, cars, kids and a pet name for you
Pussycat, told you I'd make it, you ain't believe
I guess cause coming up was hard it was easy to leave
Now think about it, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Either way shorty, life goes on
When you around, my smile's a grin, my thoughts are a sin
You ask me can we try again, I ain't fucking with you
It's on, the club jumping, I'm trying get my liquor and
You wanna suck the dick again, I'm staring at your thicker friends
I guess I'm like Will Smith in "Pursuit of Happyness"
In my hood, we all hustle and in pursuit of the same shit
Now just think, just think, that could've been you
Now just think that should've been you with me
I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider, so I ain't fucking with you

[Hook: R.Kelly]
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, go
The reason you didn't get dick
Because you got your nose up your ass like your smelling your shit
But tonight you met your match

You could've had this dude and anything you choose
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fucking with ya

Shopping spree's, drop top hair blowing in the wind
(Could've been you)
Living lavish, instead it's your girlfriend
And it ain't no other way to put it except
I know you understand it girl, it's so
But you see us in the back of the club
Popping bottles and it could've been you, but nope

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Said it could've been - could've been you, yeah
Said it could've been - could've been you

When the strap out, you know what that 'bout
We do it my way, cause a crime wave
Woah - wave - woah - wave
I wave the heat to eat, waive my right to speak
Plead the fifth y'all, don’t tell 'em shit y'all
Woah - wave - woah - wave

[Verse 1]
I'm not telling you to shoot somebody
But if somebody try to shoot you shoot 'em
Don't waste time, little nigga just do it
Any nigga out of order must be serviced
See now now you hesitating, boy, you making me nervous
The Feds know I clap heat, felonies on my rap sheet
Front on me, try to run from me, hollows be up your back, B
Pistol pop, copper top, burn, baby, burn
Revolver spinning again and again, you niggas never learn
Got a itchy itchy itchy itchy trigger finger, nigga
So if you hit me and you get me I'll be back to get ya
Man I might bring the homies in that's if it's necessary
See you might not be worried, but I think you should worry
Them bullets come in flurries, next thing you know you're buried
Yeah, I do away with nine niggas in nine days
My nine sprays when shit don't go my way
Hold it sideways, fuck around, cause a crime wave

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I talk about my arsenal, I rap about my infantry
Them crackers they be scared of me, the hood man, they into me
Yeah - I'm #1 on Forbes
Yeah - they can't fuck with your boy
Tax time is crack time, I flip that, get that back
Louie V. nap sack filled up with G-stacks
I'm sick in the head, me I'm all 'bout the bread
Go 'head fuck with the kid, see it's just what I said
See the stash, I'm making double, making kilos bubble
Gem star, boy, I cut you til' your ma don't know you
See when we play them warriors come out to play
You wanna play? Get your ass laid out today
See I'm back on the shit I was on before
So if a nigga try to stunt we gon' take 'em to war

[Hook]

[Outro]
Man, I be on some other shit, these niggas can't fuck with me

[Intro]
Ay, nigga tell 'em where you from
Southside, I'm a Southside nigga what?
Nigga stunt, you know I tear a nigga up

[Hook]
They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about

[Verse 1]
I was a snotty nose, nappy head, dirtball nigga
Saying I can't wait 'til I get a little bigger
After niggas jumped me bumping my head
Thinking I wish I had a gun, I fill a nigga with lead
Took a kitchen knife to finna poke me a nigga
Wishing I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga
Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley
Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the Caddy
Now those were the days, when crime really paid
The nine milli sprayed, I got the fuck out the way
From shootout to shootout, the bricks went fast
Robberies went bad, niggas got blast
Niggas kidnapped Drew grandpa kid
Came through and shot Ms. Leak in the head
You wonder why I got a gun? So I can get down for mine
You need that, out on the grind all the time

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It was Kangols, Cazelli shades, Pumas and corn braids
Doo-rags on the waist, brass knuckles, switchblades
Ski mask to get paid, new shells to get sprayed
Hoodrats to get laid, money to get made
Yeah, yeah I had a dream
I was rich, woke up broke, gun in my hand
Saying ''damn, dope cost sixty a gram'
I got to find me a nigga, line me a nigga
And say "give it up kid, before I put one in your wig"
Picture me thirsty, riding 'round foaming out the mouth
Saying "I don't get on, I'mma lay a nigga out"
Now diamonds are beautiful and pearls are precious
I hit you and your bitch both over your necklace
I'm wreckless, I spray the semi drunk off Henny
Wipe your blood off the shines, run and sell 'em to Benny
Fuck with me, y'all niggas know Boo Boo get busy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I gave Just a buck-fifty, ask him if I cut niggas
Shootouts in Bedford, ask them if I bucked niggas
In four-fifth they call me Boo Boo, the accident baby
Hennessy and cocaine helped to grime me and make me
My eyes don't cry, I'm a fatherless child
Got my ass whooped in Spofford, but never that now
When my name in your mouth you better watch how you talk
I'll send yo' punk ass to therapy to learn how to walk
I bust a clip, I'll hit ya hip, I'm takin your shit
Thats how the eses play, for that SSK
You probably heard through the grapevine, I'm good out in Watts
Bulletproof shit, cruising through them Compton blocks
I'm the beast from the East, but I play on the West
In the drop by myself with my nine and my vest
And you niggas best be on yo' best behavior
I was bred for this shit, front on me I'mma blaze ya

[Intro]
Dre, niggas think we're bullshitting

[Hook]
Nigga try me, son, he best have the heat on him
Whip him outta his clothes, get to mopping the street with him
Well, I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass
I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies

[Verse 1]
Nigga front on me, the goons and goblins come out
Bushmaster hundred shot, drums'll run out
They dumb out, you heard of me, they call me big homie
Me I make the register ring, I'm the cash cow
They make the hammers ring, they on ya ass now
Hair trigger, stare nigga, yeah, niggas'll flip
Six shot semi assault, let it off at your will
Here I is, where the money is, I still get biz
If D's know about the beef, you gon' still get did
It be your tombstone and your fucking grave they dig
Have that ass in the precinct trying to talk to the pigs
I'm like Damien, nigga, when I start getting loose on ya
Closest thing to Lucifer, you think you got a noose on ya
I make it hard to breathe
I come with your hustle, air it out, make it hard to eat
Have you lookin' both ways like you crossing the street

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, niggas send me the wrong message, we gon' fucking kill the messenger
Your whole clique, hollowtips'll tear up the best of ya
This ain't the "Carter" nigga, this is Sparta
It's harder, I die and be a martyr, respect me like your father
Let off a clip or let a case off
I have your pussy ass running like a race horse
Follow orders now, Yay' shoot his face off
You can have one, blast one, it's mad fun
See how when you listen to me all of the cash gone
I was born with the tech, it's a birth defect
I was conceived in the bins, ended up in a Benz
This is what happens when have-not's turn into Sasquatch
Let the gat pop, boogie down on the back blocks
It's horrific, nah, it's terrific
I got it if you sniff it, go 'head nigga twist it
Get lifted, goddamn I'm gifted

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I tell 'em ride on 'em then they ride on 'em
Get the line on 'em and squeeze the .9 on 'em
Headshot, .40-Glock blow his mind on him
It's a hit, not a jux leave the shines on 'em
Now you can watch me, nigga, like the police watch me
I move proper, go ahead catch a shell trying to stop me
That 430 Spider, carbon fibre
And my dog is like Al Qaeda, natural fighter
Rapid fire, you're sweet like apple cider
The Mack'll fire, mask like Michael Myers
It's off the wire when I get on my bullshit
No smiles, no laughs, you gets no pass
You can explain to my niggas while they whoop yo' ass
My hands itch when the money comes, it's hard to explain it
Last time I itched like this, a truckload came in
Get money, get bread, that's what I do kid

[Hook]



[Hook]
Lil' Mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it

Shorty hips is hypnotic, she moves it so erotic
Girl watch, I'm like bounce that ass girl

Don't start nothing, there won't be nothing, uhh!

Get my drink on, then get on the dance floor
Look homie I don't dance, all I do it this
It's the same two step wit a lil twist
Listen punk I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention boy I'll teach you how to do this shit
You mix a little Cris' wit a little Dom Perignon
And a little Hennessy, you know we fittin' to carry on
I'm hollering at these shorties in the club trying to get right
We gon be up in this bitch till we break daylight

Hands up on the dance floor, okay let's go

"Do you, do you, do you think about me?
Do you think, do you think, do-do-do you think about me?
Do you, do you, do you, do you think about me?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You think about money when you think about me, huh?
It's why my ex my ex, you don't wanna be her
She used to have the Beemer, now she own a sneaker
I had her eating lobster, now she eating pizza
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia
Shorty stay fly, that's why I keep her
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa
She good if I leave her, she got her own Visa
Think about them when you think about fronting
Think about stunting when you think about me
I'm the boss, Bentley or the Porsche?
Overseas see jet ski's slide across
I love the way you dress, now take it off
Put your legs high on my shoulders of course
I'm racing through your mind, but you already lost
I'm at the finish line and you're a friend of mine
Come on, let's ride

[Hook: Governor]
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, every now and then
(Do you think about me?)
Goddamn girl, we used to be friends
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I think like a hustler, I'm thinking 'bout a shipment
She thinking I'm her hustler, she thinking 'bout commitment
It's like Paul McCartney's stuck in my head
He fell in love with a bitch who walked away on one leg
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread
That's some fucked up shit, think about that, kid
I'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want?"
This relationship shit is too much for me
I wanna fuck, be friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow mines on shopping spree's
She should have what she want, just not from me
I'm thinking 'bout my future, she brought up my past
She don't care about me, she just want some cash
I'm thinking damn, girl, we used to be friends
How did shit become all about ends?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Governor]
Do you think about me? (Do you think about me?)
I know you think about me
You got to remember all the good times we had
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)
I remember when you told me
(I know you think about me)
That I'll always be special to you, darling
You were so special to me, do you think about me?

You're just my type, you're what I like
I bring that heat, you heard me right
Everywhere I go, go, let's go
Something new, it's another episode
Music bumping, sweat dripping on the danceflo'
I like it when shorty get to backing it back
When she do it like that, I don't know how to act

Baby girl tell me you can handle it

Wel, if you want it let's go

So I might ignite ya, it's fire, it's fire

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I burn it down on stage, I make it hot
'Til the Fire Marshall come shut down the spot
I have the club jam packed everytime I rock
These other niggas ain't got the style I got
I go back to the basics and break it all the way all the way down
You can hate it but face it B.I.G. and 2Pac just ain't around
Everywhere you go, there I go, I'm 50 Cent
Ghetto star by the bar I get you bent
You wanna party, let's party, you wanna freak be a freak
You wanna creep we can creep tell me where should we meet
So you can

Take these bricks and break 'em down

Now are you really ready
I said, are you really ready
I make the temperature rise, now don't be surprised

Sold over 30 million records already
It's the third time around, you know how I get down
I'm hands down, pound for pound, the best around

Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider

[Verse 1]
They putting pressure on me, son, now they want me to snap
End up like X and Whitney in my mansion smoking crack
I'm paranoid, I'm feeling like niggas is trying to get me
Forget the kids, I'm shaving off my fucking head like Britney
Man, Dre won't mix my records, now I need to talk to Jimmy
I'm falling back in my old ways, I'm riding with the semi
Who's calling me? It's Chris, he's on the other line with Diddy
But I don't wanna talk right now, my day is going shitty
Why's Jay rocking that Urkel look, man, isn't he from Marcy?
They say he's growin dreads and now he's talking like a Yardie
Man, everything is changing, I don't understand a thing
I guess this is that bullshit that all the money brings
I'm on flight

[Hook]
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider

[Verse 2]
My baby mama boyfriend like to talk like he can hurt me
I'm laughing cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes
That just makes him one of 50 niggas wanting to murk me
Niggas found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey
You can ask my son, he'll tell you "my dad's fucking crazy"
She filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin' hates me
Shady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me
I'll blow your fuckin' mind out if I told you what he paid me
He gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high
It makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die
I wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try
You get at me and miss you kiss your black ass good-bye
I'm on flight

[Hook]
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider

[Verse 3]
My lawyers on retainers every month, I give ‘em stacks
In case they wanna send me up for murder like Max
Man I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene
So if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me
There's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit
The more you talk the higher chances you're doing a bid
Today I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case
They said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face
I spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home
You tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on
When dogs are fighting in the hood nobody gives a fuck
So you get back and shake it on the field, show them what's up
I'm on flight

[Hook]
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah... ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to thank y'all for comin' out tonight
It's my third album, third tour, third time's a charm

[Intro: Robin Thicke]
Girl when I go, where we go, I wanna take you 'round the globe with me
I got dough,  plenty baby you can blow with me
And baby I know that money ain't everything
But it's fo' sho' (fo' sho, fo' sho')
And ain't for nothin when you fuck, with, me
Now when I go

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Follow my lead
Baby I can be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby, follow my lead (follow my lead)
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead - follow my lead
I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

[Verse 1]
Don't listen to the rumors, they say 50 fucking crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady, they wrong
I like you a lot, I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I'll call you a bitch
Then hang up, probably call you right back and shit
And have to say, "baby I apologize"
Cross my fingers, God forgive me for telling lies
Like Janet Jackson said, I miss you much
I really wanna feel your touch, and smell your scent
Baby, I can pass the day watching you model lingerie
I wanna spend the night tonight, shorty, if it's okay
You can be my Beyonce, I'll be your Jay
Ha ha - I got a great sense of humor
First I make you smile then I woo you, you know I wanna do ya
Or do ya?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
After seven hours, New York to London, you're wonderin'
What's gon' be the next stop - I told you
I'm a don, you gon' know I'm a don
After you shop 'til your feet hurting in Milan
Now take a picture, these are moments you can cherish
They say the scenery was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask your fan about me, they say 50 we love him
Without them there's no me, so I love them
Man they're the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less than the best, I'm perfection I guess
As my niggas are stressed, I pass the test
Every time I drop I'm burning hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
Long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't looking for commitment, we can fuck and be friends
Matter fact, we can do it right in back of my Benz
I get it done with speed

[Hook]

[Hook]
While Jay and Beyonce was *mm mm* kissin'
I was cookin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
While Nas was telling Kelis "I love you boo"
I was shining my nine, ya know how I do
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip

[Verse 1]
You want a problem with me? - no problem, it's all good
I ain't fresh out the hood, I'm still in the hood
Black rims, black hemi, nigga see me when ya see me
I appear and disappear with the heater like a genie
That party and bullshit'll get ya ass popped
Don't believe me - ask Fab, they got his head shot
I'm in the cut like germs, I do dirt like worms
Smoke on weed not on sherm, nigga it's my turn
I fire on ya ass, them hollow-tips burn, baby burn
I'm screaming "Fuck the cops!", riding 'round with my Glock
There's my pistol on my bitch, nigga fuck that box
That's how P. got knocked, thats's a jewel I drop
But you ain't peep that nigga, go 'head, repeat that nigga
You might learn a little something if you learn to stop fronting
I make it look easy on three piece bb's
Rolling locc-ing, up early with the dopemen

[Hook]
When Janet and Jermaine was *mm mm* kissing
I was bagging one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Puffy was telling Kim "I love you boo"
I was shining my nine, ya know how I do
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip

[Verse 2]
At the dice game I bet it all, you hear what I'm saying?
Take grand, I form better, nigga I ain't playing
I'm trying to get it, holla at me if ya with it
And lace up the Chukkas, we can rob these motherfuckers
My stomach is growling, they say that I'm wildin'
I'm doing my numbers, I'm getting violent
They hearing me rap and they thinking I'm playin'
Till they see the barrel and they see the flame
I need full co-operation man, give us the chain
The watch, the ring and the grill, we ain't playin'
I fire that thing, it sound insane
Holla, I got that nose candy, mane

[Hook]
When Jeezy and Keisha was *mm mm* kissin'
I was bagging one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Trina was telling Wayne, "I love you boo"
She was just running games, she told Buck that too
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip

[Outro w/ ad-libin "I got-I got fully loaded clip"]
Now nigga, let me show ya how I do this right here
Now, the Ruger hold 16
I put 16 in the clip, I put it in, I cock that
One in the head, I take the clip out
I put another one in it the clip, I put it back
That was Big with all that "let the bullets breathe"
I need a fully loaded clip



[Hook]
This is hip hop, it go clip pop
It hit 'em if ya hit me, the clip pop, it popped and it don't stop
Papa said we bang bang boogie, we get' em oh goodie
Keep the hoodie when you're fucking with me, me, me

[Verse 1]
Now what you hear is not a test
I said it's not a test, nigga, it's not a test
Got my Teflon on wrapped around my chest
I do it the best, ya heard, I do it the best
Tuck the nine by my spine all the time
Stunt when I want a dead nigga, fuck with mine
My neck and my ear get to flicking like a strobe
My wrist and my whips have niggas like whoa
I'm the underground king, I reside on the throne
In the club wilding out over Henny and Patron
Me I'm in the zone, yeah me I'm in the zone
It's bottle after bottle til G-stacks are blown
Shawty in my ear like ''please take me home''
Before the next song, come on dawg, we gone
Off to the hotel, motel, the Holiday Inn
She said ''if I knew you worked the cat from the back like that
I would've brought my friend'' uh huh huh huh huh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm so raw, yeah, I'm so raw
Me I'm so ghetto, I'm oh so hardcore
I'm down by law, this style ya never saw
I give 'em just a little then watch 'em fiend for more
Yeah, they want more, they hot and they want more
They love the way I kick it, they addicted to your boy
I'm ecstasy, I'm the ultimate trip
I have ya in the morning like a dope fiend sick
Now feel the rush, I'm like pure cocaine
I have the whole night club going insane
No matter how rich I get I'm never gonna change
I will let it rain, push me, I let it rain
I do this shit myself, lawyer money ain't a thang
The unit is the gang, the yin and the yang
We went from poor to rich, now look we the shit
You best control your bitch or she'll be in the six
Uh huh huh huh huh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm fresh to death, I'm rocking the vest
I'm strapped moving 'round with the heat
I said I do it the best, I'm not the one you should test
That's why my name ring bells in the street
I put that work in, yeah yeah
I put that work in, yeah yeah
I put that work in, yeah yeah
I put that work in, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Oh, I think she like me, hell yeah, she like me
My watch game crazy, Audemar's so icy
She like it when I stunt, me I'm what she want
I'm in that rich nigga fraternity, we only talk bread
Got money out the asshole, the money on my head
Don't mean nothing, I said don't mean nothing
The Rosé in the Rover, I'm drinking and I'm driving
That nigga try and get at me I'm pulling out and firing
To see if I'm stunting, the piece it ain't nothing
Royal fees ain't nothing, I just blow a little something
Now shorty got a thing for me, she feel like I'm the shit
My guess is I'm the kind of nigga she wanna be with

[Hook: Lloyd Banks (50 Cent)]
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Get it, get it, get it, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

Get it, get it, get it

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'm a substitute teacher, welcome to Sex Ed
She'll be an A student time she get out my bed
I'm flashy, I'm rolling with the stones
Get at me, I'm moving with the chrome
A made man, a Don Corleone
No matter where I'm at I'm doing what the fuck I want
I'm shining, my wrists all canary
Now try me, I keep a shooter near me
I'm grinding like I ain't made my first mil'
Like I ain't signed a first deal, like I ain't at the first meal
I'm hungry, I really want it all
Now watch me, I'll show you how to ball

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Life in the fast lane, fast car, fast cash
Freak bitch, fast ass
I'm where the money at, mane, fast on the draw
Fast running from the law
She like the bad boys, the bad boys, the bad boys
She like the bad boys, the bad boys, the bad boys

[Intro]
Man I finna do my thang (get up!)
It's crazy in the club when I'm in there mayne (get up!)
Trust me homie I'm not playin' (get up!)
I have the dance floor off the chain, I said (get up!)
I came to bring you that California love
And a little New York hate, it's all of the above
I'm not playin', I said I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow instructions, I said (get up!)

[Verse 1]
I ball ‘til I fall, stunt 'til I drop
'Em off the showroom floor, not the used car lot
You buy a bottle, I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras
When I get into it, I get into it
Everybody can’t do it the way I do it
I make it rain, till the sun come out
A nigga playin', we make the guns come out
Now, my question is who they gon' blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again?
Shit shift now, the game done changed
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain
I guess I made the kids want slang
And N.W.A. made the West Coast bang
Nah, it's just music man, it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

[Hook]
I have the savoir-faire
I’m the reason, everybody, here, I said (get up!)
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin'? I really don't care, I said (get up!)
I wanna see, I, I wanna see ya move
And get all into the groove, I say (get up!)
I'm gettin' money man, I really don't care
Let me see you put your ass in the air, I said (get up!)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, lady, you look good, I wanna get to know you better
You look good in them jeans and them red stilettos
You got a Bentley Coupe booty baby, I wanna drive
See it'll tell you what your mileage is when I'm inside
I wanna take you for a spin, you know, round and round
Switch gears till' your love comes down
I take you to the point of no return if you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn, I got money to burn
While they can't get a place, she drop the bomb on me
It's up and down and up and down gracefully
Rick James would've said She a Brick House
But Fifty you should go home and see what that bitch bout
I find out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up, get ya some, I know how to get ya sprung
Tune ya up and use the tongue, under the hood is so good
She said it so good, goddamn I'm so hood, nigga what up?

[Hook]
I have the savoir-faire
I’m the reason, everybody, here, I said (get up!)
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin'? I really don't care, I said (get up!)
I wanna see, I, I wanna see ya move
And get all into the groove, I say (get up!)
I'm gettin' money man, I really don't care
Let me see you put your ass in the air, I said (get up!)

[Outro]
And get into it
You're now rockin' with the Unit, I say (get up!)
And get into it
We gon' show you just how we do it, I said (get up!)
Aftermath
Still Shady Aftermath, I said (get up!)
Aftermath
Still Shady Aftermath



[Hook: PnB Rock]
It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm always gon' through the haze
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm going out of my head, he-he-head

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm exhausted, last night I lost it
Let the homie's get loose, I'm sure I'ma get the lawsuit
Nana called, my granddaddy coughin up blood
Got an infection, the cycle of life just sucks
I bet when he die, she die, just because
They been together 60 years, that's what they call love
Paid for my first cousin wedding, over 200 grand
Then two kids and six years later, he's the wrong man
I woke up this morning, really wasn't feeling myself
Thought about suicide, but me, I ain't killin myself
My cousin Corey shot his girlfriend, then shot himself in the head
Before I shoot myself, I'm shootin everyone else kid

[Hook: PnB Rock]
It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm always gon' through the haze
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm going out of my head, he-he-head
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm going out of my head, he-he-head

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My favorite uncle Roc got twisted, ‘til that liquor gave him sugar
Had complications once or twice, that shit fucked up his liver
To me he’s still the man, cause see me, I still remember
That lil’ snorkel he bought me to stay warm that December
I was sleeping in the basement, the window had a draft
Even with the electric heater, I was freezing my ass
I got some money now, so if I die before him, I'ma leave it to him
He can have a fine nurse, put that insulin needle to him
Called my son twice, he ain't pickin' up the phone
And Banks, me and him don't even talk no more
You know 'cause of me, he ain't never have to sell crack
Never used no knife, or had to squeeze no strap
But if I go tonight, I bet you I'm hellbound
For cocaine distribution and letting of MAC rounds
Home invasion robberies, we ran in that crack house
Took them niggas paper and all of they packs out

[Hook: PnB Rock]
It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm always gon' through the haze
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm going out of my head, he-he-head
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm going out of my head, he-he-head

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Then I was in the second row
The second time Em married Kim
Looking at Proof like
"How much you think this gon' cost them?"
Feels like a set up, Shaniqua's being nice to me
I rather a nigga just put a knife to me
Than go through the emotions
The confusion and commotions
Never die down in my head, they keep going
It feels like I'm God's punchin' bag on occasions
Amazing, other days I feel like I'm his favorite
I never bite my tongue, I just call a spade a spade
When life feedin' me lemons I just make lemonade
My nana beat cancer, it came back for a rematch
Life without my old girl, I couldn't see that
My grandpa was the strongest
Then he broke down and I broke down
I looked around, like if shit go bad
Now who am I gon' go to now?
That was his partner, see he knew everything about her
Now he's saying he don't wanna live without her

[Hook: PnB Rock]
It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm always gon' through the haze
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm going out of my head, he-he-head



[Produced by J Keys & Team Ready]

[Hook]
I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down

[Verse 1]
Through every altercation
I put no one above you, mm-mm I love you
They shook up when we jux 'em, you see how they be looking
It's frightening like lightning, you crack off, they start booking
It's beef until I get out in broad day with my shit out
That's when they say I'm illing and when she get to killing
Now my baby she precious, I warn you not to test us
I aim her at your head, nigga, motherfuck the vests
I'm antisocial, quit acting like you know me
Before I go postal, you know I got her on me
I'm riding with her on cocked, Audi R8 drop
Feel the wind blow, twist the indo, smoke it up, it's fundamental
You can't get to her, poke 'em up when we get intimate
That's when I get into shit
She 32 I'm 34, I fuck her raw
She revolve 6 times then I feed her more

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When niggas get to tripping
I need you by my side, yeah, so they can't catch me slipping
I take you out shopping, get you clean, get it popping
Use my finger, get ya hot, girl, I know your spot, yeah
I love you if you love me back, you never jam when I react
To sucker shit when they get hit and we take off If you get tossed
I'll be back, I want you so I'll be back
I'll never change, I be the same, a nigga stunt, I let it rain
I'm off the chain, I'm all in, mane
I'll hit you up, you think I'm playing, I be strapped
Go 'head fuck around, I be strapped
24/7 I'm back holding, mistake me for a chump
Bite off more than you can chew, more beef than you want
Come through repeatedly, show you what bananas about
I'm a mechanic, find out when the hammers come out

[Intro: The Madd Rapper & 50 Cent]
The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn-style, boy, you know what I'm saying?
R.I.P B.I.G - nigga R.I.P P.A.C - R.I.P
Enough of that shit, it's time to O.D, one time

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
The bottom line is I'm a crook with a deal
If my record don't sell I'mma rob and steal
You better recognize, nigga, I'm straight from the street
These industry niggas is starting to look like something to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ''You want to see her again?
Get your ass down to the nearest ATM''
I have dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
But I wake up early and bounce with all her shit
When I apply pressure, son, it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweating staring down the barrel on my nine
Since these Harlem World niggas seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan, tell him, "Tell your man"
Mason Betha, haha
Come up off that watch now, I mean right now
The only excuse for being broke is being in jail
An entertainer can't make bail, he broke as hell
I'd rob ODB, but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him, run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plotting to jux her for that rock Kurupt copped
What, Jigga just sold like four milli, got something to live for
Don't want a nigga putting four through that Bentley Coupe door
I'll manhandle Case like "Dope, get on the ground
You ain't with Mary no mo', where you getting chips from now?"
I been scheming on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto, nah for real, son, I'm sick
I'm bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now I'm bent and when I get like this I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun, snatch his piece then run
This nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gonna catch me, son?

[Hook: The Madd Rapper]
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'll catch P and Silkk the Shocker right after the Grammys
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timbaland and Missy with the pound
Like, "You, give me the cash; you, put the hot dog down"
I figured it out, niggas been robbing Joe before
That's why his ass don't wanna be a player no more
My attitude while robbing J.D.? "Fuck you, pay me!"
Had Da Brat with em, should've had his gat with him
DMX wanna get down, well, you tell, homie
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my dirt all by my lonely
I should rob Clue, man, his shit did well
I wanna stick TQ, but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios, take niggas' jewels and leave
Catch Rae, Ghost, and RZA for them funny ass rings
Tell Sticky give me the cash before I empty three
I'll beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Canibus wanna battle while I'm sticking him up
Fuck the cab, the coroners picking 'em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, hey nigga I saw you
He said "Why you robbing me? I got nothing but love for ya"
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all, he said, "Even my gold teeth?"
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black Jeep
One at a time, get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'mma keep sticking niggas until I'm living
I'll rob Boyz II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robin Givens
I'm hungry for real, I'm about to stick Mister Cee
That nigga still eating off Big's first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enough, I told him, "Gimme some more"
Is you feeling this? Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbing God's people

[Hook: The Madd Rapper]
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

[Outro: The Madd Rapper]
For real, yo, you know what I'm saying?
Niggas got to get stuck up, that's just how it goes down
It don't matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga or a bitch
It don't matter if you got it and I need it I want it
You know what I'm saying? That's just how it go down
50 Cent ain't fucking around, Trackmasters ain't fucking around
Crazy Cat ain't fucking around, The Madd Rapper ain't fucking around
You know what I'm saying?
So watch your backs, watch your pocket book, watch your pockets
Watch everybody on the train, watch everybody on the bus
Cause we gonna get you whether you like it or not



[Sample: Maze]
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Oooh I need you

[Intro]
Yea, I need you, I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
You know, it's real shit, feel this

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
America got a thing for this gangster shit, they love me
Black Chukkas, black skully, leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramo's shit, I'm a vandal
Got that silver duct tape on my trey-eight handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in "New Jack," I holla "Cancel that bitch!"
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low, the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiending
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

[Hook]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I don't know shit about gymnastics, I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-d's call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man

[Hook]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision
Mossberg pumping, shotgun dumping
The drama means nothing, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coupe switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty "BS" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointing at me, "Look at Niggaraci" - hello

[Hook]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)



[Intro: 50 Cent]
It's 50, It's the Unit, that means it's money, ha ha

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Nowadays niggas snitchin' so much in the street
That you gotta talk to them like they the police
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout poppin the heat
I don't know nothin 'bout settlin no beef in the streets
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout baggin the grams
I ain't never had no spot or went hand to hand
Me, I don't know nothin 'bout takin the stand
I ain't never got a nigga ass stuck in the can
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout dro or hash
Coke, dope, x, dust or crystal meth
Nah, I'm just tryin to rap to get some cash
Keep the Hip Hop Police off my ass

[Hook: Prodigy]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Aiyyo, that's my word on the stack of bibles
I don't know who did it I don't know who responsible
All I know who spittin all I know who givin
Me all this cash, just to put down twelve to get in yo' ass
Listen, keep it far away from me
I ain't got time for sittin in the penitentiary
All I know is I'm rich, all I know is that G-Unit work
When the album drop they go bezerk
Mad video play, crazy radio spins
Number one all the time, our reign never ends
Don't point the finger at us somebody's hangin
They had a beef with us, plus we don't know nathin

[Chorus: Spider Loc
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 3: Spider Loc]
I don't know nothin 'bout jumpin out splittin homeboy head
But for real that's fucked up they say that homeboy dead
I can't even think, who 'gon want him dead
Have no idea what type of gun they done him with
You see I hear no evil and I see no evil
Ain't tryin to talk to or hear from or see those people
And I ain't had them little homies burn up no regal
I've been tryin to do this music thang and just go legal
I don't know why my name in your female's phone
But you really startin to sound like a female holmes
Don't know why they told you that we sell stones
We on the internet tryin to get our Email on

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Nah nigga I don't know who sent them young boys through
To air the strip, shit just be happenin out the blue
I don't be around here, I ain't hip to the news
I don't know why that man clutchin on that shit when you move
I don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewels
You know how easy it is to get shit confused
I wasn't even in New York, I was just in the cruise
Somewhere way out in the islands with your bitch in the cruise
Oops my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze
Lose they hit from the Uz, Uz all over the street
I don't know why they said what's up I don't know who's in that jeep
He talk about me all day but I ain't losin no sleep

[Hook: Mase]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

[Verse 5: Mase]
I don't know why my charm 'bout as big as your palm
And why the diamond chain I wear as 'bout as long as your arm
You tell me, how many diamonds in my bezel
There's one for everytime I had to grind up in the ghetto
I could show you how to do it, you tired of ridin Buicks
I don't know why niggas rap for years and can't make hotter music
Even when, I don't do it chicks release body fluid
Body drop, shotty pop, and niggas wanna tie me to it
I don't know why Loon and Fabby won't just say I'm they daddy
Why them Harlem CB4 niggas just keep comin at me
Got as many beefs as 50 and a nigga go to church
Could you imagine if my hands was on work, I don't know

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do



[Intro]
Yeah, Na na na na
Yeah, Na na na na

[Hook]
Now me I'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin
A little bit of Moët, bottles of the Rosé
Feel a little buzz, then I'm getting it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in

[Verse 1]
Look as soon as I step in the club
I swear my nigga, you can feel the attention shift
Started around twelve ended up around two
I better leave with more hoes than I came here with
I can't be responsible for what I say or I do
When I talk intoxicated
Shorty say I told her I love her
I put her out the next morning saying bitch I must have been faded
I don't know what you heard about me but the word about me
That I'm no trick, I'm no sucker, I'm no chump
I be in the VIP, with my niggas round me
Saying y'all can have whatever you want

[Bridge]
Me I get it in
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink

[Verse 2]
I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so
I go hard when it's time to play
Shorty get to dropping it low, like the dancers do
In the Go-Go in front of me
She know I like to see her dance, she get to breaking it down
We get the bouncing outta control
Because I got a hell of a flow, we got paper to blow
My whole clique pop bottles galore
It's no secret the hood done peeped it
When we come through son, we look like bread
My '89 grind, make my old nine shine
Like we been moving bricks round this bitch for years
I say I get it in it's because I get it in
Now shorty there a eight but her friend near a ten
I feeling a spend my G, she fuck with me I'm into win
I'm cooler than her ma then we do this shit again

[Bridge]
Me I get it in
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink

[Hook]
Na na na na, Now me I'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin
A little bit of mo' play, bottles of the rose
Feel a little buzz, then I'm getting it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in

I was young, I couldn't do good, now I can't do bad
I ride, wreck the new Jag, I just buy the new Jag
Now nigga why you mad? Oh, you can't do that?
I'm so forgetful, they calling me cocky

[Hook]
I don't really think she want me back then, she want me now
She can play games all she wants, she cannot pretend, she like my style
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm rolling in the dough, I'm caked up
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm swimming in the dough, I'm caked up

[Verse 1]
I was a real bum now I'm really rich, kid
I come through the hood in some really, really sick shit
The Rolls, the roof gone, your flows, they're lukewarm
It's why you're not me; nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
She like the kid, my lifestyle what she wanting
Bottle after bottle by the bar, I be stunting
It's Gucci this, Gucci that, Gucci hat
Big doofy gat, hit you in your kufi hat
You know me, I told your ass in '03 "Get Rich or Die"
G-5 I fly, write my name in the sky
Pick an island on the map, I been to it
Shorty wanna try anal, her friends do it
Wrists rocked up shining, flawless diamonds
You could hardly see the face on my Audemar time and
On that J.T. shit, me I'm bringing sexy back
Louis belt wrapped around right where the TEC be at

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Getting paper's my objective, yup, now your chain gone
One false move and clap, now your brain's gone
You like me, you aight with me; me? I'm into me
I destroy my enemies even if they're kin to me
Do 'em like the Kennedy's, ching-ching that's mo' bread
Say something slick out your mouth I'll come for your head
She likes me more than you can imagine
Bad bitch, look like she fell up out a pageant
Closest I'mma get to heaven in this lifetime
Is right below her waist in between her thighs
Call her Pussycat, that's my nickname for her
And I ain't got to buy shit or run game on her
See when I stunt she stunt, we stunt together
Oh, you don't like how that sound? Aw nigga whatever
We both rock Bugarri, both push Ferrari's
I go so hard in the paint, I'm sorry

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You want me? I want you - plug one? Plug two
I'm infinitely special, girl
The Lord's gonna bless you if you do what I tell you to do
You want me? I want you - you want a Benz? I'll buy two
You should want me like you want success
Girl, with us together we'll be better than the best
Why settle for less?

Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me or you could catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line then nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal, an infantry I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler and Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playing
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lines or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture with words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine
I let 21 shots off at the same time, yeah

[Hook: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Yeah, where I'm from death is always in the air, homie
Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creeping through the hood wearing Teflon
Hit the corners, motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know, if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I'll fill your back with mac rounds
Ask Prim', nigga, 50 don't back down
I kick it funky like fiends in the crack house
Cross the line, boy, I'mma air ya ass out
Screw your face at me I wanna know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad I done came up
And if you are, fuck you cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk, but I don't know these niggas
And I ain't did no business with 'em, I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my time, I get it cause I grind
All across the globe like the world's mine, yeh

[Hook: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill

Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

Now tell me have you ever looked off in the distance
And seen the mac aiming at your head, mane?
Before you know it life is flashing, reminiscing
And your body is dripping and full of lead, mane
I done been there, I done copped that
It ain't never been a question, I'm bout that
Don't go there, you get clapped at
And if you plan to fuck around and re-route that
You'll never catch me riding around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash
Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
Cause I be long gone like The Ripper so

[Hook: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around



[Hook: 50 Cent]

The voice in my head say fuck all these niggas
Then I start thinkin', I should rob all these niggas
Man my homies then wan' do whatever I wan' do
I say I wan' eat they say shit we wan' eat to
Let's ride around find a nigga stuntin' on front street
With the shine's on niggas be lookin' like lunch meat

Fuck a ski mask, man, niggas know who I is

I'm up early in the mornin', tryna make a move
Come in here with me shorty take your lil' on the school
Even though she cause the drama, you love your baby momma
I hit her with the llama to get this cake
Give us the coke, the cash, the combo to the safe
But she don't know it, damn, OK we'll wait
I play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone
Put a gun to her head sayin' daddy come home
You was rollin' poppin' bubbly, didn't think it get ugly
In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad
Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearin' you
That the nine will jam right in my hand

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
I got his homies screamin' Buck you need to calm down
Niggas be gettin' killed everytime you come around
We ran up in his crib, made his momma kiss the ground
She askin' God, what my baby done did now?
I'm takin' everything, jewellery I want it all
Duct tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall
Fuck waitin' we gon' starve waitin' on tomorrow
So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow
I'm impatient like a money hungry rap star
I jack him for his chain and I can get a new Jaguar
The mack I have his brains all over the fuckin' sidewalk
And I'mma be on CNN again it ain't my fault
March nigga step, right nigga left
G-Unit soldier I'm thuggin' till my death

[Hook: 50 Cent]

WOO!!! From the midst of the dark barkin it's Bill Gates
From the behind the bodega with two eights
I mean, with intentions of settin yo' ass straight
I mean, yo' ass leakin, bleedin reachin for faith
I mean, you barely breathin, with your soft survivin ass
What happen to your hood vibe with your good ridin ass
What happen to the gangsta that you see on TV

Duck tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall (Give me that nigga!)
Fuck waitin, we gon' start waitin on tomorrow (Huh!)
So ask satan if he got a car that I can borrow

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I came in the world cryin' and fussin'

Preacher man come around talkin'

I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Ay, came in the game gettin' money
Flippin' chickens, whip it, gettin' money
Niggas get to playin' with the money
Clique bang for the money, shit changed over money
They love to see a nigga on the bottom
Catch a come up, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 O's
Looky here, bitch, I'm A-okay

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Came in the game gettin' money

But you love playin' games with the corny shit
Messin' with a nigga, only bought it 'cause I want it
You love to see a nigga at the bottom
You tried to come up, you don't keep it on the low
They like a drug, don't like you to call them hoes
I'm tryna break a booty down like 36 O's
I think I love a big fat A-O-D, make that bitch cum for free
Look at mommy shake it, I'ma call her, she gon' hit my line, fall in love every time
But if I don't pay, she gon' leave me, never had a real reason, all I get is bits and pieces
And I believe it, I ain't think this shit was easy, who am I now?

Too much on my mind right now

[Intro]
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go shorty, it's your birthday
We gonna party like it's your birthday
We gonna sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday

[Hook]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep it's twenty knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck
But homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll the weed up!
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', "50, you hot."
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shorty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow
Her girlfriend willin' to get bi and they ready to go

[Hook]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed

[Bridge]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You the faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
"Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate then let them hate and watch the money pile up."
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be

[Hook]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed

[Outro]
Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither
We in the club all the time, so pop, pop off

When you make it go round and round

[Verse 1]
I step up in the club I'm like "Who you wit?"
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique

On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves

Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch

Then I'mma get in shorty ear and I'mma let her know

[Hook]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin and touchin a lil' bit
Get to lickin it, a lil' bit

[Verse 2]
This is 50, comin out your ster-e-o
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get, your bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard, about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
#1 on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like oh man
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin, party jumpin, I said loud and clear

[Hook]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit

Get to kissin and touchin a lil' bit

[Bridge]

[Hook]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit

[Produced by Detroit Red & DJ Don Cannon]

[Verse 1]
D's trying to pin a murder on me
In the precinct they saying I done murdered homie
I told my lawyer I ain't heard of homie
And everybody know my niggas murder for me
You see homo on your crib, it ain't a burglary homey
They finna to have me stuck in purgatory
I'm down to do the sticking when it come to the orgy
Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
Wait, I'm getting sidetracked, back to the story
These cocksucking police got it in for me
They flash their lights, they wanna rough me up
Frisk me, find my burner and cuff me up
But history repeats itself, they never learn
The Unit's the new Bebo's, who gon' be Eddie Byrne?
Huh, we'll find out when niggas let off the rounds
And his partner's screaming officer down

[Hook]
Police get in the way, I'll murder them
I'll murder them
A nigga already got three strikes, I'll murder them
I said I'll murder them
Any motherfucker touch me, I'll murder them
I'll murder them
You don't believe me wait and see, I'll murder them
You see I told you I'd murder them

[Verse 2]
They saying I'm an accident waiting to happen
I got one in the head, I'm just waiting to clap it
A pimp told me I was made for this mack shit
So just get you a white girl, don't fuck with no black bitch
I got two felonies from selling that crack shit
And the third one, came from showing niggas my mac spit
See I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggas crawling under cars when I start to cappin'
So they don't know what to say to the captain
But they know if word get back, something gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, but I ain't been snitched on
When you snitching where I'm from you gon' get your shit blown
Southside - I make the best of the worst
We gotta share the same bitch, okay, I go first
Cause your baby's momma is my baby's momma
I come through to see my little nigga with the llama

[Hook]



[Intro: 50 Cent]
What you saying boy, boy?
Ha ha - said what you saying boy?

[Hook: 50 Cent]
See, the weak get walked on, the soft get barked on
See me, I never ever ever run
Niggas say the wrong shit to me like he wanna do me
Somebody be at him with my gun
What you saying, boy? You think I'm playing, boy?
Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world
What you saying, boy? You think I'm playing, boy?
Watch your mouth, girl, this a man's world

[Verse 1]
Listen, nigga you play me and I'mma go crazy
You push me I'mma motherfucking trip
I come tripping through your set busting off my TEC
I gives a fuck if you's a Blood or a Crip
Nigga from J.F.K. to L.A.X., I'm back through the sets again
Gangsta life, that's right, crazy-ass Mexicans
Do it the raw way, broad day, AK
Spray cause a melee, mayday mayday
Freak bitch suck me on tape like Ray J
Niggas that I'm up against know they can't fade me
I'm the last one, you know the last don
She know she wanna come, bitch, bring your ass on

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
See, I come from the Southside where niggas is outside
Right now with the rubber grips
Niggas say they gon' see me to hit 'em on G.P
Then I bless 'em with the chains full of bricks
When you come from where I'm from you come from the bottom
They ain't supposed to get this rich
So the Fed's got my phone tapped to treat me like Fat Cat
Now I'm thinking "man, ain't this a bitch?"
Niggas stick cola in cola, from moving the yola
Next thing you know they up in your crib
Saying ''where's the stash at?'' You move they gon' blast that
So I suggest you stand still, kid

[Hook]

[Outro]
This a man's world
Watch your mouth girl, this a man's world



[Produced by Jake One]

[Intro]
(The realest thing you could do is put a drumbeat with nothing but a drum beat)
Niggas, niggas copied my style, Russ
That's why I had to switch up on 'em
Know what I mean?
Mad niggas sounding like me

[Verse 1]
I run the show now, I got the blow now
You wanna hold now? You can come cop
I'm on the low now, I got the four pound
In case a motherfucker gotta get shot
The only time is coming, slow down
See they know now, I won't hesitate to make shit hot
D's will shut your block down, after you're shot down
We gonna come through and set up shop
You niggas gone work for me now, you gone see now
How I change shit, re-arrange shit
See for you, dawg, this is new shit
I'm from Southside, nigga we do this
They say I'm grimey, it's hard to find me
When  the sun lighten up the sky
Niggas wanna line me, try and kill me
Go ahead nigga, I dare you to try, fuck that nigga

[Hook]
We moving on up
Yeah, we gettin' that dough for sure, we moving on up
You'll get chromed up
Cash is flow for sure, the dough, nigga you know what?

[Verse 2]
I'm 'bout my bread now, I'll cut your head now
You know you eating niggas, you should be dead now
I hold a Glock down, I gotta drop now
Nigga I'm eating, you know I ain't gone stop now
One more trip, one more flip
I move a truckload, nigga, not one brick
They make me so sick, fucking sick to my stomach
You niggas talk shit, but they know that I want it
My clique's so sick, niggas know how we on it
Light up more shit, the car there when we on it
I spit a gem star. get your name carved into neck
Have my little homies run up on your ass with the Tec
Yeah, I stunt in the Vette, got stash in the Vette
I get head in the whip, I get ass on the jet
I'm oh so fresh, so motherfucking clean
24 inch gleam, when I pull up on the scene

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Been smoking that dip, the PCP got them thinking they can walk on water
That ecstasy will have a nigga rock hard trying to fuck your daughter
The LSD will have niggas running round trying to kill you for us
Smoking that piff, sipping that yak, talking that shit, loading that strap

[Hook]

[Hook]
Nigga, my gun go off - you see the barrel turning
You feel the hollows burning, nigga, now you're learning
Nigga, my gun go off - call it attempted murder
Nigga, I'm trying to murk you when I come back busting
Nigga, my gun go off - don't try to say I'm tripping
When I get to flipping and I smack the clip in
Nigga, my gun go off - we call it putting work in
Leaving niggas hurting, homicide's lurking
Nigga, my gun go off

[Verse 1]
Fuckboy, you can see it to believe it
Try to dodge and weave it, end up a paraplegic
Believe me, its easy, I'll hurt you, I'll murk you
I'll pop something, drop something, I ain't going to stop hunting
Run, run, 'til you're spun, one shot, one gun
One 911 emergency, it's murder, B
It's excellent execution when I'm pulling the trigger
No mistake for that cake, I'm hitting you and your niggas
Feel the flame when I aim for the top of your brain
See the spark and the bang, nigga, shit ain't a game
Do the math or get blast, bullets go through the glass
Goes through your ass fast and the leather seat in your Nav
Nigga, its not a war when there's casualties on one side, I ride
Turn it up on you nigga after Jake ride by
I click-clack, that's that, I don't flash, I mash
I wave the Uzi at them, I make a movie out them

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You better lose yourself in the moment
Use it, fuck the music, I'mma let it go
You only get one shot before I back out and fire back
At your hat, your back, your ass crack, your nutsack
Your Cadillac, if you make it to that, I'm hitting that
The 70's was smack, the 80's crack
The 90's was grimy, millennium MACs, man
Clips on the whips I ride in them, bad bitches, I ride in them
Don't worry, I'll get them, gat's jammed or unjammed
God damn safest the safety don't work, squeeze the eagle, it chirps
End up faced down in the dirt more than hurt
Bring the beef where you hang out, bang out, shots ring out
Hit your shoulders trying to blow your brains out
Hit your homies in their legs, bet they have their canes out tomorrow
You know tomorrow's just a day away
If you can keep your heart beating, then your ass awake

[Hook]



[Chorus: 50 Cent & Chris Brown]
Ayo, quit Captain Savin', serenadin' them hoes
She no Juliet for no Romeo with no dough

Please don't interrupt me when I'm talking to my jeweler
He's putting them diamonds all over my Franck Muller
Me I get busy, I put that work in if it's worth it
Come through hit you up, I'll make a crime scene perfect
Niggas talk about me all the time behind my back
They don't talk about me in my face because I'm strapped
See me in the club, I got that Henny and that 'gnac
A couple cups of that and I just don't know how to act
By the second bottle that's when I just get to buzzing

[Verse 2]
I blew a hundred G's on my bitches in Miami
They think I'm the sweetest thing invented since candy
Me I catch amnesia when you ask me 'bout the shotty
I don't even know my name, switching lanes in my Bugatti
Nigga, I ain't crazy, bitches like me cause I'm paid
They want me, LeBron, Kobe or Dwyane Wade
When I say I'm balling I'm not talking 'bout a ball
I'm talkin' 'bout Tiffany & Co. stones out the mall
Niggas they can hate all they want, but they know they like this
Me I'm like that painting on the wall, baby I'm priceless
You could come and work me over, baby, on the night shift
Catch me on the night shift, see how freaky I get (okay, okay, okay)

I'mma get my drink on and party like it's ok

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Trust me man it's ok, bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house they're like, "Oh no"
50 got 'em locin again, they open again
Got 'em sipping on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting, doing my two step fronting
Now I'mma tell you what Em told me, homey
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's for sure
I got the info you already know
Man I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it

[Verse 2: Havoc]
You wanna search me for certain but hurry up cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some pop shit these tricks will frame ya
But, in any event, keep fucking with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holler
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I don’t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starving
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
You already know how it go, I bang, I shine
I play, I stay I'm going for mine
I'm young, I'm black, I'm rich and yes
I'm ghetto than the motherfucking project steps
I'm cool, I'm calm you looking real stressed
I'm strapped I'm armed kid, hold your head
I'm known for gat popping, when I got problems
I don't run, I just gun you all up
But we ain't come here to start no drama
We just looking for our future baby mamas
With money with face with style and body
I cook I clean I swear that mami
Just as long as you don't go off and tell nobody
I go down low, I'm lying I'm trying my best to let you know
Sugar pop get at P
The Doc beat make it easy to get 'em in the bed sheets

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it

The way you move (the way you move)

All control (all control)

You're so seductive you make me wanna touch it
I ain't got to tell you, you know I wanna fuck you
I'm feelin your style, you better watch me now
My tongue'll be in your mouth, my hands'll be in your blouse
When you get me aroused you put a spell on me
Man if I can't have you I'mma go crazy
I want you bad now and if you want me
Girl come to me now, I said come to me now

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Come to me now, you don't come to me now
Apple in your mouth, tackled on the couch
Shackled in the house, I'll be back in about
20 minutes or less, with my Hannibal mask
So when you wiggle around and giggle in that cage
I knew I couldn't wait to get you off that stage
From the moment I met you had to let you know
I just wanted to get you through my bedroom do'
You makin me feel like I'm in middle school still
You squeal like a little girl, you're pitiful, chill
We gon' fuck, I just popped this little blue pill
You can leave but wait, I gotta shit on you still {*phbbt*}
I shouldn't have to say it shorty you should know
I hope you really gettin into my creep show
Let me shit on your chest and if some pee comes out
Just guzzle it down, just guzzle it down

[Hook: 50 Cent]
On your mark, get set girl now here we go

[Outro: 50 Cent]

[Hook]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 1]
Now, shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies
They pay her, ‘cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country
Think she like me ‘cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryin' to holla ‘cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryin' to holla ‘cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid!
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see
You fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P

[Hook]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 2]
I'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holla at me
If you fuckin' with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch

[Hook]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 3]
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her
When I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
You sayin' it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch
She always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
‘Cause I need four TV's and AMG's for the six
Ho make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick

[Outro]
Yeah, in Hollywoood they say
"There's no b'ness like show b'ness."
In the hood they say
"There's no b'ness like hoe b'ness," you know?
They say I talk a little fast
But if you listen a little faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch



[Intro]
Yeah, Shady
Aftermath
G-UNIT!!

[Hook]
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in you

[Verse 1]
You mistakin' me for somebody that you should be testin'
You should be stressin', I'm finna fuckin' teach you a lesson
Rap 101's in session, Em laced the track that I'm blessin'
Smith & Wesson's the weapon in case you was guessin'
Cappin' 'em, kept in my Benz, hot beginning to end
Watch the 22's spin, my hoes they perfect ten
I got shot up but I got up and I'm back at it again
Motherfuckers that thought I wouldn't win pretend to be friends
At first you fail, try, try, try, try again
I'm the best, don't you get it? Forget it, when I spit it, it's crazy
You love it, admit it, you like that I live it, it's Shady
Aftermath in yo' ass, bitch!
If it's not a classic when it's done we trash it
Flow I got it mastered, stunt and get yo' ass kicked, bastard
When measures get drastic, Glocks made out of plastic
Cock it, aim it, blast it, run nigga, now stash it

[Hook]
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in you

[Bridge]
If there's a genie in a bottle of that Dom Perignon
I'ma drink 'til I get to that bitch
Em and Dre gonna introduce me to the 'burbs
They gonna listen to my words
In the hood they feel my shit (Break it down!)

[Verse 2]
Picture a perfect picture, picture me in a pimp hat
Picture me startin' shit, picture me bustin' my gat
Picture police mad, they ain't got a picture of that
Picture me bein' broke, picture me smokin' a stack
Picture me comin' up, picture me rich from rap
Picture me blowin' up, now picture me goin' back
To my momma basement to live, shit, picture that
Where I'm from it's a fact, you gotta watch your back
You wear a vest without a gat, you's a target, Jack
Hustle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack
Sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, holla back
50 Cent, too much Henny, man I'm bent, I'm outta here

[Hook]
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in you

[Outro]
Man, I ain't' goin' to jail, not even to visit a nigga
You wanna holler at me you write me
Matter of fact you gotta send it to Sunset Blvd up in the Mondrian
Ridin' around in one of Dre's Ferrari's, nigga
Oh, matter fact, I might be in Detroit ridin' down 8 Mile Road
You know, in one of Em's joints and shit, ya heard?
I got places to go, man, ya know
Shady Aftermath, we finna start printin' money
Puttin' Em's faces on these motherfuckin' bills, shit
Ain't shit you can do about it

I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
Yeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
Yeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)
They wanna see me shot up (shot up)
Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, look look, I come from a different crew, you fuck with me I'll get to you
A clip or two I'll cripple you just 'cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol pop, a pussy drop, drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie mini moe, nine, trey pound or forty fo'
Pick a strap, The Tec, the Mac, the Hawk, I stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains, I know your name and where you rest, I make a mess
The hollow tips will hit your chest, you cough up blood 'til EMS
Come pick you up, you know you're fucked when you get on the stretcher
'Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven
The system I done been through, it is nothing new to it to me
They lock me up, they let me out, you seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals while they up in corrections
They come home get, a nine, then commit crime in perfection
It's murder one, they found a gun, now they doing ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint, the shit's going terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)

Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Man, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid
You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sac with MAC-10s
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetuses falling out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard, still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props
If drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)

Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killing so villainously
Still as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers
You know what we're like on the motherfucking mic so try us
And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers

[50 Cent]
It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing, be bleeding, wheezing, breathing, he half dead
He must ain't know, but now we know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn

[Eminem]
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her - I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
And put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub

[50 Cent]
When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous
Look deep in my eye, see many many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho (a psycho), a sicko (a sicko)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife pulled (knife pulled)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you make me (you make me)
They wanna see me shot up (shot up)
Locked up (locked up), then cage me (cage me)
I'll come back bigger (bigger)
Stronger (stronger) and angry (and angry)



[Intro]
(Classic) That's right it's a motherfuckin classic!
Yeah... yeah... it's 50 nigga!... Yeah... yeah... yeah. Yeah

[Verse 1]
Smile nigga my next album might be my last
Got what I came to get, the stacks and the stash
I told Jimmy Iovine ass to shut the fuck up
Got Dre callin' Shady sayin Em what's up?
We done came this far, we can't stop now
Em, 50 off the hook, he got to calm down
I guess I'm out of control, my mind, body and soul
Tell me I'm bein pimped and it's makin me sick
You know Em made that company over a billion dollars
And when he ain't around they sayin foul shit about him
Yeah we fucked up, we both don't know our pops
We both don't like the cops, we don't know when to stop
You know Kim is Shaniqua and Hailey is Marquise
D-12's G-Unit and we always in beef
Ja and Fred Durst, both of them jerks
Got put out the game, ha, ha, ya lames!
Paul's Chris Lighty, Tracy's Nicki Martin
Boxes of ox, sarge is a Glock
My nine is twenty four seven on watch

[Hook]
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah

Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You know Oprah got In Da Club on her iPod
She don't want me on her show though I guess I'm too hard
She sat Kanye West down, and talked about his crash
But she don't wanna talk about the bullets in my ass
Spike Lee don't like it that my money come fast
I hate it when a nigga get to countin my cash
Now I can give the kids a positive message like Farrakhan
Or I can give 'em pistols and targets to squeeze 'em on
I'm tryin to make a decision damn, leave me alone
I'm like Martin Luther King people listen to me a lot
It's non violent, non violent till I'm hit with a rock
Then it's Coretta fuck this, go and get me my Glock
Wanna call me crazy? Okay it's cool
I'll have your kids tryin to be, crazy cool in school
Truth is they like me, more than they like you
They watch me and emulate, everything I do

[Hook]
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I have days when I feel like everybody's against me
Sharpton ain't comin when the feds snatch 50
Just my luck Johnnie Cochran passed
Right before the crackers come snatch my ass
I'm the Don King of crack, the Pretty Floyd of rap
Put Southside on the map, I did that
Bill O'Reilly can't stand me but his woman think I'm cute
I bet she wanna see me in my birthday suit
Met Al Gore and his wife in them first class seats
She said she didn't like rap until she met me
You gotta understand I'm a charmin young man
A whole lot has changed since I went hand to hand

[Hook]
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]

Smile for me! If I gotta go away to make you feel better
I'll go away! Ya know? I got what I came to get
My money right, ya nah mean I'm good don't worry 'bout me I'm good
Ya know? This is about you now, is it 'gon make you happy to see me gone?
Are you gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Are you just gonna forget about me? I meant nothin to you?
Is that what you sayin to me?
Cause ya breakin my heart...
Hahaha, I mean you're really breakin my heart

[Intro]
I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse 1]
Your daddy fucked your mama then fucked your sister
Then climbed in your bed playing with your shitter
Go 'head, take your belt off and hang yourself
Matter of fact grab your strap and bang yourself
Jay's a big man, he's too big to respond
I'm a big dick, you know the one everybody's on
You 'gon make me sing ''Murder Was The Case''
Bullets ricochet *ping ping*, shoot the star off your face
I'm international, I'm never home, mane
I've been gone so long my accent changed
You better watch who you fuck with, mate
Or you 'gon make me carve your ass up now straight
Come on, Game, you will never be my equal
Your homies shoot doors, my niggas shoot people
See me I'm what you never 'gon be
I'm in that tax bracket you never 'gon see

[Hook]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse 2]
That nigga Buck like Gator, tell momma he done smoked the TV
I ain't know he fucked with more dope than B.G
Plus a nigga sipped more syrup than Pimp C
Man keeping these motherfuckers rich ain't easy
Especially when a nigga wanna stunt like Jeezy
And his CDs' didn't sell like his CDs'
Man, that nigga blew all of his chips on them breezies
Mad cause the world won't treat him like Weezy
Look I don't give a fuck, nigga, please believe me
No nigga in no vocal booth around can see me
It's crazy how I make this shit look oh so easy
They say, "50, nah, I don't fuck with him, he oh so greasy
Yeah, he used to share that paper now he oh so greedy"
It's funny how they shit on me cause them they need me
See me I'm number one, I'm loading up my gun
I catch ya and you done, you pussy nigga run

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They say first comes love then comes marriage
Instead I got Shaniqua in a baby carriage
Then came the cash then the baby mama drama
I gave that bitch a half a mill, she blew it on Prada
I remember when I met the bitch and she ain't have nada
Got my son on some fly shit, now I gotta buy shit
Man, I can't even flaunt shit cause everybody want shit
Everybody mad, damn even my dad
And I don't even know him, now how the fuck I owe him?
I ain't giving nobody shit, I'mma show them
I gave Game hits, he told me to suck dick
Started screaming Westside and Dre ain't say shit
Now we just eat off him, and when I talk to Em
A smile comes on his face, he told me here's the case
''Enemies stay enemies but friends they change
Niggas go crazy over money, my mane''

[Hook]



[Intro: Jeremih & 50 Cent]
Oh yeah
Look at you, you lil' dirty ass nigga you ain't shit
Ouuh

[Chorus: Jeremih & 50 Cent]
They used to tell me that I wouldn't be nothing

Pull up, get your bitch, in drop top we roll out
Y'all niggas ain't shit
They all act like they ain't know bet they know now
I'm up nigga

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I ever said fuck you nigga I meant to
When you come up how I came up, life's not gentle
See that tear in my mama eye, that meant the rent due
I prayed on it, God didn't say nothing back
Saw that cocaine you had, we turned it to crack
Had a couple grams of diesel, we was just tryna make it
A brown sheepskin on, niggas was tryna' take it
You know the kind of drama that come with the leather bomber
Niggas try to jump you gotta stay with the lama
Suckers shit niggas get shot over some nah, nah
If niggas want problems I'm sayin' this no problem
I catch 'em on the late night and dearly depart 'em

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Look back
Look where we started from
It's all the beginning
They ain't tell me why we come this far
Now they feel it in the air
When it's 2AM and the sky is filled with stars
Driving down the boulevard
I remember when...

[Chorus: Jeremih & 50 Cent]
They used to tell me that I wouldn't be nothing
Yeah
Now Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting
Look at me now nigga
Pull up, get your bitch, in drop top we roll out
Y'all niggas ain't shit
They all act like they ain't know bet they know now
I'm up nigga

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I remember all the shit you said to me 'cause it hurt me
Then it helped me 'cause then I was down to do the dirt
See the knots in my pockets boy, I go the cash route
I see you with your skinny jeans, punk, with your ass out
And I got all kind of money now
Look what you made me
Got a different type of temper, man a nigga get crazy
My A.P. look like I done dipped it in water, hard
Like me when I done dipped in your daughter (GOD!)
From playin' with Hot Wheels to collecting cars
That shit in the duPont REGISTRY's in my yard
Somehow the bullshit shifted
Now the motherfuckers calling me gifted
And I be like

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Look back
Look where we started from
It's all the beginning
They ain't tell me why we come this far
Now they feel it in the air
When it's 2AM and the sky is filled with stars
Driving down the boulevard
I remember when...

[Chorus: Jeremih & 50 Cent]
They used to tell me that I wouldn't be nothing
Yeah
Now Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting
Look at me now nigga
Pull up, get your bitch, in drop top we roll out
Y'all niggas ain't shit
They all act like they ain't know bet they know now

[Intro]
When I'm out in N.Y., boy, it's blunts and Phillies
When I'm out in L.A., boy, it's wraps and Swishers
Now Blood walk to this, now Crip walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit

[Verse 1]
I'm in my Lambo, maggot, my fo' fo' faggot
Doors lift up, I'm like Go Go Gadget
See the shit I got on, homie, I'd hate too
My Teflon on, boy, my government issue
I'll hit your vertebrae, bullets rip through tissues
Your wife on the futon hugging that Shih Tzu
Homie, you a bitch, you got feminine ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got fo' fifths and bananas on the K's
And got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades
When I made fifty mill, Em got paid
When I made sixty mill, Dre got paid
When I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid
I ain't even gotta rap now, life is made
Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy, mane

[Hook]
I'm laughing straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

[Verse 2]
I keep nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold
Got it off the street movin bundles and O's
Seventy Three Caprice old school when I roll
Breeze pass with the E-Pass, fuck the toll
No more platinum, I'm wearing gold
I'm internationally known, it's the kid with the flow
That brings enough dough, it's never enough though
Shit I need mo', new shit out the sto'
Baby blue was old, fresh off the flo'
Stashbox by the dashbox in case they want war
Make the purple bring the green in, fuck the law
I'm oh so raw, I'm hot, I'm sure
I'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe, boy
I set the club on fire I told ya
I'm the general; salute me soldier

[Hook]

[Outro]
Now work it out now, shorty work it out
I wanna see you, break it down
Now back it up now, you know what I'm about
It's like a bank job I'm in and I'm out
Now work it out now, work it out, work it out
Now work it out now, work it out, work it out

Product stretch
I got it mastered, man, in the hood I'm like plastic, man
Stretch
Fantastic man, I make the money come faster, man, yeah

[Verse 1]
Your favorite bad guy's gone, The Joker's dead
So for now 'til forever you're stuck with the kid
I ain't supposed to be a boss, I'm supposed to be an enforcer
I'm supposed to hold a gun, not be stuck in an office
Michael pimped me? I was in the passenger seat
We was comfortable with me 'round, cause I blast my heat
94' I was trying to catch Mason for bricks raw
Charlie fucked up the jux, they took no orders little boy, stretch
The cocaine, I go hard when the drought come
When the straps come out, son, niggas know the outcome
Lay low, stay low, you may see Jesus
You hit with a stray, yo, for no fucking reason
You praying for a Benz, it's a blessing you breathing
It's a miracle that God gave me this TEC, now I'm eating
Cop it, chop it, profit, it's all for sale
Cocaine, candy rain, I'm so for real, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm the dope-man, coke-man, smoke-man, whatever-man
The X-man, TEC-man, you better respect, man
Get the green, triple beam, inf' beam, murder scheme
Fiend, morphine, dream, codeine, more lean
Gun pop, one shot, body drop, it wasn't me
Tell the cops it wasn't me, you saw me right? It wasn't me
It's not my M.O., see me I make it stretch
Get in the way I put a body on my TEC
Call me crazy, I die for what I stand for
I have ammo flying out the Lambo
Like Commando, nah, like Rambo
I keep my cool as long as the fucking grams go
Wooptee-woo, I'm a Chef like Rae
It's hot in here, I'm by the stove cooking crack all day, stretch
We gon' bag up all night
We ain't goin' nowhere 'til the count bag right, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's a bird, it's a plane, no, it's pure cocaine
Trying to blow selling blow, I'm who you fuck with, man
I got Spiderman high, I made Batman fly
Your favorite hero took a hit, now here you try
I don't care if it's a sin, I don't care if you're ten
Look around kid, it's a cold world we're in
If you ask me my offer is extremely handsome
A little Charlie, Marley, a little bit of Manson
Yeah, me falling off is really far fetched
I turn a little to a lot, I make it stretch
In come the Franklin's then come the Benji's
Fiends by the crackhouse, dirty and dingy, yeah

You ain't strong enough, nigga, you sweet
You probably go against me, and win
I oughta kiss you, you'd probably like that
But you don't stand a chance, nigga
Fucking faggot

[Verse 1]
I do more than talk that, I mu'fuckin walk that
Blue Yankee cap back, fuck around get clapped at
I sleep with the stainless, I walk with the stainless
Man, everybody know about 50, I'm famous
New York, New York, I run New York
Ask Dread at the weed spot, I come through in the mean drop
In different boroughs I have different moments
On different days niggas know how I'm on it
I'm pretty like a Harlem nigga
I'm a shooter like a Brooklyn nigga
I'm a hustler don't get no bigger
Queens, Southside 'til they bury me
BX, two TEC's, flames out the nozzles
R1 One wheel, Christian Dior goggles
Spare with me, start some shit, send the shooters out
Come out the club, we out front with the Ruger's out
Nah, ain't no sense to talking peace, my brother
That beef will probably send your monkey ass to see Allah

[Hook]
These niggas ain't strong enough
Their money ain't long enough
When they bump heads with me
They find out the guns do bust
We getting paper, in God we trust
These sucka ass niggas
These niggas ain't strong enough
Their money ain't long enough
When they bump heads with me
They find out the guns do bust
We getting paper, in God we trust
Suck on this, nigga

[Verse 2]
When I said I'll kill ya, I'll kill ya, as a kid I wasn't kidding then
Special ED kid in the back on Ritalin
Crib all fucked up, hooptie all fucked up
Pockets all fucked up, now nigga, what's up?
I'm rich now, niggas know about my dividends
Look at the Robb Report, check out what I'm living in
Fuck a spot now, I'm 'bout to buy a yacht now
Crib the size of the New York City block now
Okay okay, try me and get shot down
I'm like a zebra, I got so many stripes
I'm the fucking general, I run my clique right
It was five of us, all of us millionaires
Now one's a fucking junkie, and one's a fucking queer
Now it's three of us, that's the way we started
They call me crazy, cold-blooded and black-hearted
I don't play no games, niggas beg for mercy
Then we "T.O.S.", put that ass to rest

[Hook]



Yeah! Ha Ha!

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be

[Verse 1]
I know Boo Boo I mean 50 he a grimey nigga
Think he shot my brother I'm a find that nigga
We don't see his punk ass unless he on TV
Yeah he did my brother dirty but he don't wanna see me
Member Rydell from KP thought he was his man
Put him on the table to bag up he beat him for grams
How you think he got that money for that chalk gray Land
That nigga robbin' and stealin' everything that he can

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear hoes running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 2]
Yeah I know Curtis, he used to fuck with my friend
Used to come through my projects pick her up in his Benz
Niggas from my buildin' always used to ask about him
Like he in and out of town, right? That niggas get down, right?
I used to say, all I know, is the nigga get money
And you standin' in my way, excuse me dummy
Ronda she told me that nigga a freak
And McDonald's ain't the only thing that he eat

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 3]
I love 50 Cent, that's my dad
But even my mom talk about him bad
She says since he blew up, he changed for sure
He's really fascinated with these fancy hoes
I don't know why but there personalities collide
And my dad will swallow blood before he swallows his pride
You know the kids in my class they be sayin he's crazy
They just like him cause he roll with Dr. Dre and Shady

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggas running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 4]
Man 50 fucked up, I mean real fucked up
He left us in the hood we fucked up
I can't believe this nigga gettin' all this money
Still actin' like he in the street tellin' niggas they can't eat
You know this motherfucker went and bought Tyson's crib
Got Bentley's, Ferrari's, and all that shit
He don't even come through to try and help niggas out
That's that bullshit. See what I'm talkin' about?

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

[Verse 5]
That's my Grand baby I love him I raised that boy right
He ran to me cryin' sent him back out to fight
Put a battery in his sock or pick up a rock
You ain't a chump, you want your Grandma to think you a punk
Look at my first Grand baby, he is a big rap star
Bought me a house, diamonds, and a brand new car
I taught him what it takes, to go this far
Boy I'm the reason you are what you are

[Hook]
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be

[Verse 1]
I had five hundred grams and fifty in 58 bags
Fo'-hundred Benz, eight thousand in cash
Then the ball dropped, gun popped, Banks got blast
I make it so hot, one shot'll melt yo' ass
Got popped up, cried 'til my eyes turned red
Then told myself in the mirror "nigga, you ain't dead"
I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic
I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I got it
When you see me in the hood motherfucker don't talk to me
'Less you wan' talk about using the hawk for me
When Al blew Black away I had him on some stupid shit
Then my rap shit worked, now I'm super stupid rich
All I do is stunt now, I'm so Maybach
There I go fronting again, I meant to say laid back
Go 'head move reckless, get banged for your necklace
I serve him with the semi, feed him a clip for breakfast

[Hook]
You want some? Come get some
Nigga it's murder one when I toss my gun
You might see me let it off, you might see me run
But you won't see shit time the police come
Huh? You want some? Come get some
Nigga it's murder one when you see my gun
I just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done
You just bleed and bleed 'til the police come
Huh? You want some?

[Verse 2]
I got a eighth of dope left, half a pound of purple
Shooters in my circle, try me I'll let 'em murk you
Got more guns than a gun store, beef ain't what you want, boy
You wanna be nice to me, you wanna shoot dice with me
You want a ace on purpose, why you so nervous?
Nigga we from the same hood, we come from the same shit
You got gonorrhea too? We fucked with the same bitch
Getting money is necessary; see me I'm a visionary
And I'm saying that house should be a crack house
Now see it how I see it or I'll bring the straps out
The tech and the mac out, the Sig and the Taurus
The Koch and that Heckler, then nigga we warrin'
I let my pistols speak for me and all of 'em foreign
Click-clack, comprende? I'm criminal-minded
Toss my Nina in the sewer, bet nobody find it
'Til it's rusty and fucked up, forensics have fun, what?

[Hook]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Come get it, I'm strapped now, I'm with it
Come get it - huh? You want some?
Come get it, I'm strapped now, I'm with it
Fuck that nigga - huh? You want some?

[Intro]
This is how monsters function
Leave me alone
I ain't fucking with nobody

[Verse 1]
Keep fucking with me you going turn me back to Boo-Boo
Have me casing out your crib, trying to pop your fucking noodles
She was 20, I was 12, man my Nana said she raped me
I just smiled from ear to ear, saying take me, baby, take me
Since high school, nigga, I ain't got no friends
Got two 380s like the Ying Yang Twins (Haaan)
That's spot clicking till the Ds run in
Then it's bail money and lawyer fees, you got to have ends
Freshman year I had that CBR Hurricane
In a ill herringbone, I got them swinging Heroine
I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump
Then you can run forrest run, retard when I dump
They take kindness for weakness, niggas don't respect that
So me I'm where that Ruger, that Pump and that Tec at
Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then
Shipment, but you had like twenty bricks in Richmond
We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreaming
We just got in the town, we was strapped up scheming
First Country caught a body, then Country caught a body
Then I popped a couple niggas then Country shot everybody
It's cold blooded, it's real shit, you got to love it
Trey-eight Snub it, and don't think nothing of it
It's the way of the wolves, it's how they train us to move
Get it popping when we shopping, niggas hold down the tools

[Hook]
I seen niggas getting rich
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I was tired of not having shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I seen niggas getting hit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
We was slinging that shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
Here I am

[Verse 2]
Unsure since we was little niggas, son, since we were seven
Armed robbery, first degree, my man did seven
Niggas popped his whip up, hit his Camry with a seven
He a lucky motherfucker, I bet he make it to heaven
My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk
My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fucking stash up
I had 250 grams stashed on the porch
I mean, how much you going to smoke, man? How much you going to snort?
First the VCR went, then the TV went
He stole out of mommy purse, she thought it was me, kid
I ain't ask her for no money, son, cause I was out hustling
She was looking at me sideways like I'm a thief or something
That hurt me, come on son that wouldn't hurt you?
I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple
I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge
The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub

[Bridge]
The Lord don't have imperfections, baby
So I think I'm perfect the way he made me
Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy
Some say I ain't shit, some say I'm amazing

[Hook]



[Intro]
GGGGGGGG G-unit

We got to get the get well cards
Niggas is sick

Motion picture shit
Hahaha!

[Verse / Freestyle]
Now don't think I won't hit you because I'm popular
I got a P-90 Ruger to pop at ya
Catch you slipping I'ma give you what I got for ya
My clip loaded with 16 shots for ya
You never had a hot gun on ya waist and blood on your shoe
Because a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you
Homie, you ain't been through what I been through
You not like me, and I'm not like you
I'm like an animal wit it when I spit it's crazy
Got semi-autos to put holes in niggas tryin' to play me
One shot is not enough you need at least a Uzi to move me
After four bottles of Dom the kid start to feeling woozy
I write my life, you write what you see in gangsta movies
I'm gangsta to the core, nigga you can't move me
I find my space at the top, I got this rap shit locked
I never heard of you, you heard of me, I murder you
Spit shells to your convertible
Lotus you notice richer or poor
Hollow steel go through your door, this is war
You scared of me you not prepared for me the kid is back
50 Cent, I know you like that, I know you like that

Get yo' hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Nigga roll that good shit
Get yo' hands up high, hands up high, hands up high

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You wanna dance, let's dance nigga, I take you to the prom
I'm armed, trey-pound in my palm, I'm calm nigga
My momma made a baby boy, the hood made a man
My first 14 grams, took that and made a grand
I do this, you knew this, I told you pussy
Your fate, your death day'll fucking come if you push me
Have you like E.I. E.I., uh-oh after the four-four blow
I get low, they say I go like a pro
It's a wrap and I'm ghost in the smoke like a roach
You've been clapped and in fact there's no coming back from that
I'm the last of my breed, no Henny, no weed
Just my vest and my semi in the back of the Bentley
Enage, a mirage, see I'm there, then I'm gone
Cause my lawyers are strong and my money is long
So when I'm right I'm right, and when I'm wrong I'm right
I hit your ass up right, nigga it's nighty-night

[Hook]
Man I run this rap shit
Get yo' hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Rest in peace to Biggie Smalls
Get yo' hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
R.I.P. to 2Pac
Get yo' hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Nigga roll that good shit
Get yo' hands up high, hands up high, hands up high

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Ayo, I'm higher than a pilot, man, I catch a body, man
Beat the case, I lie on the poly-gram
These O.G.'s talking 'bout, back in the days
I have a R.I.P. sign on your MySpace page
I'm in your top 8 nigga, drop 8 nigga
G-C-T Coupe, it's sour grape nigga
I'm an ape nigga, a guerilla in the mist
I hold weight, nigga, my connect got bricks
I went gold, you went platinum, we still got the same cars
Same house, and still fuck the same broads
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
Damn you look good girl but get your teeth fixed
I'm the Teflon Don boy, I get busy
Your next two songs you do them shits with Pretty Ricky
Seven-sixty, drive by light tint
With two hoes in the whip looking like flint

[Hook]
Man I run this rap shit
Get yo' hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Rest in peace to Biggie Smalls
Get yo' hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
R.I.P. to 2Pac
Get yo' hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Nigga roll that good shit
Get yo' hands up high, hands up high, hands up high

[Intro]
It's 50 a.k.a. Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of livin' to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it

[Verse 1]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with a 9?
We do this all the time, right now we on the grind
So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine
If D's ran up in my crib you know who droppin' dimes

[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'

[Verse 2]
Damn, homie
In high school you was the man, homie
The fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar
If you play with my paper you gotta meet my Beretta
Now shorty think I'ma sweat her sippin' on Amaretto
I might hit once, then dead her, I know I can do better
She look good, but I know she after my cheddar
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie, and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doin' the same old two step
Guerrilla Unit, cuz, they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast, we thugged out

[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'

[Bridge]
Me I'm no mobster, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV

[Verse 3]
'Cause I hustle, baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I gotta eat on these streets
If you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they goin' murk 50, how?
We ridin' round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR-15's
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?

[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'



[50 Cent]
Yeah, 50, Olivia
We both think alike

[Olivia]
We both think alike, uh-oh!

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Now shorty we can party 'till the break of dawn
(We both think alike, uh-oh!)
Go 'head 'till ya tired than I'll take ya home
(We both think alike, hell yeah!)
If you invite me in I'll come take it off
(We both think alike, uh-oh!)
Than head to ya bedroom to break ya off
(We both think alike, uh-oh!)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm not gon' waste ya time talkin 'bout shit that you know
I'm so hood that even when I try to hide it, it shows
I be grindin' girl I'm focused, I be gettin' my dough
You know that If It ain't the flow, than it comes from the O's
Plus a nigga like a pimp when it comes to the hoes
Every hood, every city all the gangsta's now
Front on me, and you'll be gettin' hit up fa sho
I make it hot when it's twenty muthafuckin' below
See wit' me in VIP you can twist and blow
When the champagne finished baby, order some mo'
Keep a eye on you close while you out on the floor
Doin ya move will have a nigga's greased if it's a swole
If ya ready to roll shorty, we can just roll
When you ready to go, I'll be ready to go
See everything I do, I do on the low
So anything we do, nobody will know

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now look, I know you into the shiny things
The platinum, the chains, and the diamond rings
The twenty-four inch chrome on the range
I see you when you crouch by ya window pane
Now shorty, me and you we came up the same
The fact before rap, I ain't have a thing
I hustled, got my weight up, now I'm sittin on change
I mean I got money out the ass, maine
When niggas get the beefin', I be laughin'
Cause I can send my homies through to blast them
Stick 'em with the hump, or just slash 'em
"Now fool are you crazy?" Is what we ask 'em
But back to me and you shorty, decide, think
First I'll put the burnin', it's the g-string (uh-oh!)
Leave it up to me, we can do it my way (uh-oh!)
And get straight to it, skip the fore play (uh-oh!)

[Hook]



[50 Cent]
Yeah, I'm fuckin wit dis
It's that classic shit, that gangsta shit, yeah

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Man I watched the sun go up but come down - sayin what if?
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out - sayin what if?
Homey I play the block tryin to get my packs off - sayin what if?
Man if I get a shot, I could make it to the top - damn what if?

[50 Cent]
If I got on some pretty boy shit like Puffy
Niggas in the hood, man they just wouldn't love me
If I wore a suit every day like Jay-Z
Niggas would think I bump my fuckin head and went crazy
If I put diamonds in my teeth like Baby
I wouldn't stand a chance of tryin to sell like Shady
If I put out bullshit joints like AZ
Every chance niggas get, they'd try and play me
But I move around with a little 380
A nigga try to stunt, a nigga get sprayed B
If I smoked weed all day like Snoop do
I'd see the world different through my dilated pupils
If I bust dance moves on you like Usher
Niggas'll say "50 that ain't gangsta, fuck ya"
Man I'mma just keep doin what I do
Cause niggas can't do me, better than I do, ha ha

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
What if I had blockbuster flicks like Will Smith?
And all the backpack niggas loved me like Mos Def
I'd probably be a cool-ass nigga like Ice Cube
Picture me in this flick right now lookin so cool
What if I was a low-key nigga, just laid back?
Hustle to keep a homey 'round, somebody to hold the gat
Man what if Halle Berry was my next baby moms?
Shit I'd give that child support up with no problems
If I caught a case and jumped bail I'd get caught
Cause I'm that nigga everybody know from New York
But if I was the new rap nigga you didn't know
You'd be sayin "Damn that kid got a sick flow"
What if I just cruised through your hood on 22's
Bumpin Curtis Mayfield or Marvin, somethin smooth
And if I let the top down on the Azure
Yeah that'd make you sick to your stomach I'm sure, ha ha

[Hook]



[50 Cent]
Yeah, it's 50
One shot, one kill, what's the deal
Yeah, what's the deal

[Hook]
Listen lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
N ain't playin', when it rains it pours
N get set up, when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothin' changed, n doin' the same ol' shit
Them new hollow tips in them same ol' clips
In the projects, n fuck with the same ol' chicks
For somehow, they still think that they game is so sick
Now from the rip, n know I'm 'bout my grip
I don't trick, man I barely even feed a bitch
She say I'm stingy, I say, "I don't need you bitch"
Go 'head leave, see if I chase you, shit!
Tell yo' mammy, I catch her in the streets I'mma get her
She know I'm on parole, why she call police on a n?
She just mad, cause a nigga pockets on swole
When she ask to borrow some, I say hell naw!
I was tellin' the lil' homies all about this shit
To keep yo' mind on yo' money
And don't trust no bitch
Ke Ke hit high notes, when them pigs came
But her ass kinda fat, so n treat' her the same
This is real

[Hook]
Listen lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
N ain't playin', when it rains it pours
N get set up, when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Blood stains on my stoop, when Akbar got shot
When homocide outside, nigga I'm not
This the third time them niggas done circled the block
It's money out now yeah, but damn it's hot
They'll love to catch a nigga, on a direct sale
They say, "tell us who caught the body, or you goin' to jail"
Look, if you know the drill you stay the fuck outta dodge
And say what's happenin' to the captain
And say what's up to the sarge
Fuck bein' in a cage man, that shit for the birds
Charlie drunk, drinkin' wild irish rose on the curb
I know a spot full of n tryin' to bet a few bucks
Hopin' they number come out, they can have 'em some luck
To Ace to the duece, and stumbled off mad
Lost his re-up money man, that's all he had
Magazine from the store, so he can look at the cars
And do pull up's in the park, on the monkey bars
Mad as fuck

[Hook]
Listen lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
N ain't playin', when it rains it pours
N get set up, when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours

(Gun shots, police sirens and helicopters going off
While it thunders and rains)



[Intro]
Ohh!
The top feel so much better than the bottom
So much better

[Chorus]
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 1]
Summertime, white Porsche Carrera is milky
I'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy
It's funny how niggas get to screw-facin' at me
Anyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise through nobody hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't gon' fall for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops down, you can hear the systems thump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut your block down, quick to put a hole in a chump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'

[Chorus]
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 2]
Niggas love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts and from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, "Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang."
She can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang
Homie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit, mane, the store owner watchin' you
Before somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen

[Chorus]
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Hook: Quavo]
I'm a lucky bastard, my car like Dukes of Hazzard
I never had a ghostwriter, I'm afraid of Casper
I fucked her one time, then my homie fucked right after
Always keep it real, I ain't never been an actor
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt

[Verse 1: Quavo & Takeoff]
Big bowl of money, I look like big bowl of money
Got a Tommy on the Kawasaki, blowing out an onion
Takeoff Frank Lucas, I got 'em itching
They addicted to Bobby and Mr. Whitneys
And they drinking on Actavis what a feeling
Momma told me drink water, flush out my kidney
I'm a lucky bastard, dab, ooh, dagger
Your bitch a happy camper got an iPhone she a snapper
I know some rappers but know some more trappers
They got more money than you rappers
Talk like that actor you smoking tobacco
My Louboutins stomp you out like I'm a Kappa
I’m gonna do my dab like the Heisman
I wanna coach, I’m Quavo O'Ryan
Look at the feds I know that they spying
I'm gonna disappear like I'm the Mayans
Hop in my rocket I bet they can't find me
Fuck all that bullshit and stop with this nonsense
These Benjamins and Jacksons got something in common
All of my niggas about money and violence
For real, for real, for real, this territory shit is real
Fuck how a nigga gon' feel, I'm just gripping on the steel
Think I might go in Beverly Hills
Get a mansion about 28 M's
No Jack and Jill but I done been on the hill
Count it then I pop a seal

[Hook: Quavo]
I'm a lucky bastard, my car like Dukes of Hazzard
I never had a ghostwriter, I'm afraid of Casper
I fucked her one time, then my homie fucked right after
Always keep it real, I ain't never been an actor
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
I've been spending every penny
Monday up in Magic City
Sucking on them tig ol' bitties
Diamonds dancing on me like they Diddy
I've been feeling gritty but I'm looking pretty
I been popping bitches like I'm Pretty Ricky
Got a bad bitch and her name is Nicki
She be with the ménage and come from Philly
Yeah, swear that my father's killing me
All of these racks breaking my back
These dollars signs is crippling me
Yeah, I look in her eyes I'm an enemy
I come from the trap, my niggas attack
You won't recognize your family

[Hook: Quavo]
I'm a lucky bastard, my car like Dukes of Hazzard
I never had a ghostwriter, I'm afraid of Casper
I fucked her one time, then my homie fucked right after
Always keep it real, I ain't never been an actor
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt
All these racks make my motherfucking back hurt



[Intro: Chuck D]
We got our ways, but ain't we human beings too?
If our lives don't matter, no lives matter
Thus life is our future, dying is unacceptable
Living for what we believe in is life itself
And that in itself is beautiful, people

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Beautiful people let's take a second and think
We continue these issues our ship will drown and we sink
This is nothing political this is so we be sync
Stick together forever and we'll weather the rain
We'll weather the storm, let's try to move on
Build a better community, so our children be norm
Transform from arms and bombs like Vietnam
Teach your kid how to eat and teach your kid how to farm
Watch what you put in your body so you can live it long
Mind, body and soul in tact, proud and you strong
This rap ain't no lap it's more like a marathon
This track ain't no track just something I set it on
Live life in harmony, put love in your arms
Forgive to receive the blessing of peace and calm
Just a product of Malcolm X and Farrakhan
Martin Luther and Marvin Gaye came all to do a ghetto song

[Hook]
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
People, people, people, people
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
People, people, people, people

[Interlude: Mama Ferg]
Beautiful people can be defined by
Her hair, her eyes, her body
Beautiful people
Beauty is behind the surface
It is the soul, the spirit
That lies beneath the soul, the skin
It is the power of that beauty that holds us
That strengthens us
It is the way we dance when we wanna cry
It is our mind that creates the definition of the beauty
Clear your mind, clear your body
Reach for the strength within
We are all beautiful people

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
All my beautiful people, all my beautiful people
I'm the ghetto apostle, come on, follow I'll lead you
Tell them put down the pipes, liquor bottles and needles
Treat your family right, your mommy and daughter need you
Grandma, auntie and cousin, OG told you about thuggin'
But he ain't amount to nothing, he on top of that oven
Then on top of that corner his little niggas be drummin'
Blicka-blocka they buck then they finna hit you with somethin'
Jack-o'-lantern with him as they finna open your pumpkin
Popping your collar pimping and this ain't nothin' 'bout stuntin'
If you ain't talking thuggin' then you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
Bullshit, I'm the pope, I think I am onto something
I wanna empower people, wanna empower people
White, purple and yellow, and all of my browner people
We can be positive, don't let negativity kill you
First start with your friends then move a whole town of people

[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Yeah
I had a good year
All them music festivals and shit
I can't believe MTV crowned me King Bonnaroo
Haha, shit was a party on stage, yeah

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Just got back from Bonnaroo, that shit was amazing
Girls crowdsurf to the stage for the booty shaking
Express Yourself set the tone, by Diplo
Today was blazing so they taking off their shit slow
Show them titties, show them titties, me and Marty screaming
TJ on the 1 and 2s, he got the party heating
My DJ making it far, just hope his daddy see him
Jam Master Jay Junior, I know that he can't believe it
He could be the next A-Trak, just keep dreaming
God got me on a mission, nigga, I'mma keep preaching
Lords Never Worry, point blank period
We divine and then shine through these dark demons
Flying vultures, bra leeches
Moment you want some pussy, they act like they can't believe it
They got a rap nigga like "well, at least can I see it?"
Claiming you got a man, you was outside my trailer just fiending
Giving me celibate speeches, I got a hell of a penis
Give you that crack pipe, girl, who the hell is your dealer?
She laughing now, you acting mad cause I ain't let you beat it
I play myself anyway cause you the weakest
Now I'm straight off the stage into the tour bus
Had enough of these hoes, it's time to get focused
I couldn't figure what to write
Until I mumbled some words and started on the chorus

[Hook: Wynter Gordon]
All of my life and all of my days
I never thought I would be here, I never thought I would be here
All of my life and all of my days
I never thought I would be here, and I feel it now, and my bones and my body wanna lift off

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
I spoke to Lauryn last night, man, she still got it
She performed Ready Or Not, the whole set was rocking
Skrillex brought me out before her set, I did Shabba
She said "I watched the whole thing, Ferg, your shit was proper"
Damn, Lauryn was watching my show?
Plus I came out to Juicy and I fucked that Biggie flow
But it was cool cause the crowd caught the words for me
And when I did Work, they sung the whole shit for me
Coogi down to the socks, then the crowd applaud
I'm getting rich so I gotta stop the stage dive
Ain't smoked in a minute, but I sorta get a stage high
Especially when I'm done and the whole crowd stay live
I'm tired as hell, still come out for the encore
Looking fatigued, I'm out of breath, I need to run more
Then I hit my DJ like "we got one more"
And we nod, yeah, then I go for it, like

[Hook: Wynter Gordon]

Everybody going to this cocaine castle
You'll probably see your reverend at this cocaine castle
Pimps and prostitutes at this cocaine castle
Doctors in their suits at this cocaine castle
Babies in they pampers at this cocaine castle
Crying with they grandma at this cocaine castle
Momma doing drugs at this cocaine castle
Tryna get some buzz at this cocaine castle

[Verse 1]
All another day in the crack house, where demons be talking to fiends
Couple hits and they blackout, needles be stuck all in their veins
Au revoir, sing a song that be stuck all in your brain
That shit so potent, it have you doing devilish things, yeah
Take a walk through the darkside, where a nigga don't see no light
One hit is all I need, that nigga gon' take your life
What about your wife? What about your kids?
What about your crib? What about your moms? What about her tears?
What about that shit? What about your uncle? He died last year
From the same thing, you kissed that glass to hide your fears
Bring nothing to your life, you die, you die
Basing your life upon the hope that you gon' get the same high

[Hook]

[Interlude]
I remember when I was, when I was lit the fuck up
I was, I just, I just, I just remember that day
I remember what it feels like

[Verse 2]
Tripping off this weed got a nigga slow motion
Chills all over my body like some cold lotion
Tryna wrestle demons like I'm fucking Hulk Hogan
Looking for the cure but I'm seeing no potion
Tryna sleep it off but it only gets worse
Seems like my whole life fucking been cursed
Devil tryna get me in this fucking paradise
Fucking all these bitches raw just to roll the dice

[Outro]
Why you in my dreams?
Why you in my dreams?
Why you in my dreams?
Why you all in my dreams?



[Hook x3]
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

[Verse 1]
Woke up, seen Daddy in bed with another woman
Thought that was Mama, "hey ma"- hold up, that couldn't
Be her, what I'm thinking, cause she just went to work
It was a naked look-a-like and Daddy there with no skirt
See, Daddy was getting busy when I barged in
Then when I said "mommy?", he chuckled and grinned
Then I soon realised that the  crust in my eyes
Had the chick looking like Mama love from the side
See, Daddy was a player and I wasn't surprised
He would holla at the girls when we rolled with the guys
Should I hate or embrace these ties?
I mean, I praise this dude, god's sake, he's fly
He couldn't do no wrong in my eyes
But at the same time I hated to see my mama cry
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
I've got commitment issues, did from when I was young
Wasn't tryna fit in my uncle's Timberlands, he was dumb
His shoe was too small to fit my big toe in
Ain't wanna walk in his shoes, he was just hoing
He stayed broke, them bitches provided for him
Whether skinny, fat, black or tyrannosaurus
He was a gigolo, and never minded whoring
Guess the money gave him new ways to ignore it
Pussy is pussy, and new clothes the way he saw it
This ain't Enyce nigga, what she brought in?
To see him kiss her ass made me nauseous
Then he'd give her sloppy hugs like my baby gorgeous
He was just doing that for the new forces
All this fucking bullshit that had my brain distorted
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
I've got commitment issues, even with my craft
Didn't think Willie Lynch was that good at math
Took a lil black baby 'way from mom and dad
Now he lost in the field and it's so sad
The mind of a slave, at a young age
Can't talk to a girl or know how to engage
He think being a gentleman is wrong and gay
But he feel that way cause that's how he was raised
He watched dad diss mom, she got play
And your uncle only had a girl when he got paid
All this shit put my life in a maze
Then when I grow up, marriage in a haze
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
To all the ladies, I'll just say it one more time
Somewhere along down the line, it's affected our minds

[Hook x4]

[Verse 1]
They told me West got robbed (Damn)
Where the fuck them niggas be at?
They took the chain up off his neck
I heard the mac started running laps
Oh, what the fuck, how they gon' do that?
My nigga got stuffed, he didn't wanna view that
I heard they had guns, they ain't wanna use that
They ain't wanna see Tom in the fucking boo cap
What about Lil Mitt, where the fuck he was at?
That nigga too little, they ain't wanna do that
But he got more heart than most of them cats
If he had that thing, that thing go blat
Lil young trap lord with a little backpack
Feel at his pulse with a bunch of big gats
They ain't wanna do that

Revenge is on my mind
And now they got my brother
Thinking about picking up the nine
And making them fuckers lick the blood up
There's no need for wasting time
Niggas gon' get it one way or another
You want to live the street life
Go ahead, go ahead
Your wig get blown living that street life
You can't live long living that street life
Got to watch your moms in this street life
They'll come to your home in this street life
Full clip from the chrome, living that street life
Your chromosomes all on the streetlights
Lights, somebody gon' die
Body on ice, right

This shit make no sense, I got taste
Girls come to my house to have an orgy parade
I just hit 'em like this and leave 'em horny for days
My daddy said I'm a prince, now I'm a king
He sacrificed and went to Heaven, now I'm livin' his dream
You gotta walk like this, you gotta talk like that
I talked this shit into existence, now my stacks on racks
I got stacks on stacks, stacks on racks
Racks on top of stacks and stacks on top of them racks
Move like that on them cats, you move like that and get smacked

[Hook 2]
I got a hundred dollar bill to get the bump off your face
I got a hundred dollar bill to get them bumps off your face

Use these hundred dollar bills to get these bumps off your face

Balling on some new shit, this NBA 3K

[Verse 6: A$AP Ferg]
Still go to the PJ's, fuck a bitch where she stay
Can't come to the new crib, she ain't getting no leeway
Probably fucked your new bitch, don't believe what she say

[Intro]
Nigga fuck the Trap Lord I'm the Dope Lord

[Hook x4]
Do the dope walk, do the dope walk
Nigga fuck the trap lord I'm the dope lord
Now I'm on my gangsta lean like a dope fiend
My walk meaner than Cara Delevingne's

[Verse 1]
Check out my walk because it is so amazing
Nothing like Bobby Shmurda's but I congratulate him
More like a gangsta lean let's get this picture painted
Drop it low then pick it up before you hit the pavement
I was confined to crime since I was about 5 years old
Now nigga make up your mind you gonna rap or sell dope
I was followed like crazy this rapper life a pillow
But don't sleep on this nigga because I'm hard as brillo
Nigga I ain't no game, I never played Nintendo
Through puberty I was popping pussy and popping pimples
Popping cuties with heavy booties and pretty dimples
C'mon do the dope dance, man it's pretty simple

[Bridge]
Now do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
A-do the dope-de-dope dope walk
A-do the dope-de-dope dope walk
Now do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do the dope-de-dope dope walk
A-do the dope-de-dope dope walk

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I almost fell I gotta pick it up
I almost fell I gotta pick it up
Got a story to tell, let me let you know what's up
I got a story to tell let me let you know what's up
I was at Abyssinian playing basketball
But it was different from playing basketball at the park
Cause at the park the dominicans had the packs of raw
That would make the fiends lean but they never fall
All that standing on the block just like a Pokemon (pika)
Dope dealers sitting like I gotta catch em' all
Uh gotta catch em' all like the theme song
I ain't Morgan Freeman, ain't no one to lean on
I'm a dope dealer, on a dope walk
Now the sky turn to blue gotta get this dope off
They’re like Menace II Society with O-Dog
Now the fiends leaning like he bout to touch his toe dog, look y'all
I'm the dope lord and y'all my fiends, y'all wanted this all your life
I’ve been coming up with hits like constantly, and you know my shit’s so tight
And all of y'all rappers got nothing on me, this shit I ain't even write
And all of y'all bitches they on my D, cause they wanna hit this pipe

(Yeezus style scream)

[Outro]
1,2,3 Go
A-do the dope walk, I just don't walk x5



[Verse 1]
Her hands all on my fade, bitch pop that ass in the coup
That bitch got Lisa Leslie money, she balling, Sheryl Swoops
She keep rubbing her nose, I can tell she wanna snoop
That coke make my dick numb, she put it all in her glutes
Feel like Bishop from Juice, gun all in my boot
Sayonara feeling sauna when I blast that ass with that Uz', ooh
Blast that ass with that Uz', better hope to God it ain't you
Trap Lord with about ten jeeps, no telling what I might do
I fucked your bitch, nigga and she about to fuck my crew
She just finished with Twelvyy and now she off to Lou
Pussy-ass nigga wearing all black, claim they off to shoot
I pray to God he ain't lying, my gorillas live in the zoo
I got killers with the deuce-deuce, them Tan Boys my niggas
They gon' ride with me too, bust they nines with me too
That's my bilingual crew, who do sign language true
Bandannas in they pockets, how the fuck we gon' lose?

[Hook]
I fucked your bitch, nigga, I fucked your bitch
I fucked your bitch, nigga, I fucked your bitch
She sucked my dick, nigga, she sucked my dick
She sucked my dick, nigga, she sucked my dick
Ride around town with about 100 niggas
When you see me come around, don't try to run up on a nigga
Four pound lay 'em down, now you six feet under, nigga
If you feel some type of way, then let me see you dump nigga

[Verse 2]
Ride around my city, feeling like P. Diddy
Glock 9 in my silk shirt, nigga, no Pac and no Biggie
Spilling on, my teeth hurt but these grills worth a milli
I was in the club, I seen the whole thing, I was right next to Meek Milly
Shout outs my nigga Chrissy, don't bug over these bitches
I ain't fucking with these ratchet hoes, I put a slug in these bitches
Pop a pill in her asshole, put drugs in these bitches
Impress my girl, she fine as fuck so I ain't loving these bitches
I just be fucking these bitches, ain't no love for these bitches
Diamond Dollas, that Fergenstein, I DDP on these niggas
Feel the heat when it bigger, bullet creeped to his window
Nigga I'm going double wood, fuck around and catch a splinter
Nine milli, my nigga, get hung, high ceiling, my nigga
All the macks in they Maybachs, no 550, my nigga
They saying Ferg went from "Kissin' Pink" to a Young 50, my nigga
I'm in court for your bitch ass, that's real shitty, my nigga

[Hook]
I fucked your bitch, nigga, I fucked your bitch
I fucked your bitch, nigga, I fucked your bitch
She sucked my dick, nigga, she sucked my dick
She sucked my dick, nigga, she sucked my dick
Ride around town with about 100 niggas
When you see me come around, don't try to run up on a nigga
Four pound lay 'em down, now you six feet under, nigga
If you feel some type of way, let me see you dump nigga

[Outro]
Dump Dump

With about 100 niggas
Don't try to run up on a nigga
Now you six feet under, nigga
Let me see you dump nigga



[Intro: A$AP Ferg & Busta Rhymes]
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up (remix)
Fuck that shit, we get turnt 'til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up
This that East Coast motherfucker
Call me Mr. East Coast motherfucker
Let me give them a friendly reminder real quick, yo

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Y'all already know the god gotta talk
Every single time I come you niggas know I gotta do it
Yes I gotta do it and I gotta kill 'em and I gotta hit 'em
Yes you know a nigga gotta beat 'em stupid
Only got 41 seconds just to give a nigga shit
Every second bitch I gotta use it
Somewhat a nigga blew it and I cannot
Grab the microphone and not make a motherfucker lose it
And I make niggas jump in the back
Niggas up, she in the back of the truck
Lil' mommy wanna fuck and she really wanna suck
When I finish with it then we go in the back of the club
And we do this shit again my nigga, pronto
Bip-de-badda-de-booda-de-beat it like a bongo
Banging on the pussy like a nigga named Alonzo
Head game crazy, that make her the head honcho
Mad cause I took his bitch and now he thinks he macho?
Somebody better call the cops yo
'Fore we run up inside of that nigga's lil' condo
Put him in a box so the nigga in a cargo (cargo, cargo)
Shut a nigga down (fake bitch)
Throw a bottle at ya, shut a nigga mouth (break shit)
Come and follow me, stand up on the couch (shake shit)
Let us wallow, niggas know we're in the house (trey fifth)
East Coast nigga!

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
10031 is where my zip is
Live in Har-ar-lem, up in the trenches
Run through a bodega like I ain't got riches
Run through a bodega like I ain't got (come on)
Don't do it for the haters, I do it for the bitches
My flow Al-Qaeda, I kill rap niggas
Y'all Now and Laters, sweet ass-niggas
Soon as you get famous, they wanna ass-kiss
Only thing that I'm missing is Hov verse (JAY-Z)
I get a feeling, they want the old Ferg
"Cocaine Castle", "Hood Pope" Ferg
Got a question to ask: do you know Ferg?
Do you know that I come from where the toast burn?
New York, New York, 143rd
On Hungry Ham up on the corner
Fiends taste the lean, they never sober
For being in the streets to run a culture
I never been in the weave, I had hoes, brah
Who's that jiggy motherfucker with the clothes, brah?
I'm finna kill these motherfuckers with the flow, brah
I'm the best in the game with the flow, brah
In New York I Milly Rock to "Magnolia"
I love the East but shoutout to every coast, brah
South to North and even West Coast, brah

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Blackin' like I'm fresh up out retirement, my flow still monumental
Mental, couldn't ride an instrumental but they ridin' dick
I set the standards for requirements, so call the firemen
Just me, myself and I, the world is mine, I put the "I" in his
His posse too clean, (aye) his diamonds like tip (aye)
His skin too clear, (aye)  his bitch gon' stare (aye)
So mind your biz, how they find the time for minding mine
I find these college chicks for top with Kylie's lips
Oh my, oh my (run it)
Run it, run it like you want it (run it)
Run it, run it like you stole it (run it)
Running, running like I'm going (woo!)
Running, pitching like I'm bowling (woo!)
In my city, gangs run the inner city
Load a semi for the chiddy bang
Flacko, Fergie, Frenchie with the bitties
Hit up Remy for the pretty gang

[Verse 4: Dave East]
Lately I feel like a Beatle
I'm Paulie McCartney just rocking Moschino
Moscato or Pinot
I got some bitches to hop in the Regal, phenomenal deep throat
I'm more Ali than Muhammad
My noodles was Ramen, go Google my diamonds
I got some shooters in college
I feel like a coach, I'm recruiting and signing
Look, I still be moving in silence
I'm ballin' in blue like I'm hooping in Dallas
Bitch I don't play for no Mavericks
You need to think who gon' pay for your casket
Ignorant bastard
But I'm still conscious enough to give hope to the masses
Watch the coke do gymnastics
Dominique Dawes, foreign my car when I'm mashin'

[Verse 5: French Montana]
Chain busting it down, wrist busting it down
Your bitch busting it down, Rap game I'm fucking it now
I could be a jeweler, neck that's Slick the Ruler
You niggas is comedy, talking fast like Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
KRS-One, Big L flows, son of a gun with the Buffalo
Head on my wrist is a P1, made more money than E1
One time Chinx, two time Yams (Yams)
Get the money, slide like a violin
You know my nigga Max almost home?
You know who run the East Coast zone nigga?

[Verse 6: Rick Ross]
In the kitchen culinary, I could whip a Bloody Mary
And I wish that blood would dead me, I'ma get your brother buried
Gangbanging with your halo, business on the payphone
Bitches pussies drying up, like Taz's Angels
Never was a client, 'cause that boy ain't buying it
And I got a bottom bitch, my top come on consignment
Step up from the minor league, double M the dynasty
No I never sold dope, I just got me a finder's fee
Following my frequency, niggas rapping week to week
Suckers be so weak to me, text but don't speak to me
You can never speak for me, see the B.I. chemistry
Check into the crazy house, I'ma turn the labels out

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up (remix)
Fuck that shit, we get turnt 'til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up
This that East Coast motherfucker
But I know this West Coast (Snoop Dogg)

[Verse 7: Snoop Dogg]
10/20 was my date of birth, the day I came to Earth
Bottles sipping, love to burp, young nigga that's doing dirt
Long Beach across my shirt, all y'all niggas gon' get merked
What the fuck is you talking 'bout?
Me and Ferg, we gon' put in work
Bang on ya' gang culture, out of this world
It's all on a bitch, is she a Blood? Is she a Crip?
Don't slip, think not, on the block where it's hot
Legalize with the nines, give a fuck about a cop
Real shit, this is it, from the bottom to the Bay
This is anybody K, California all day
Yes-sir, on the curb, Mossberg by the van
Little homies on the roof with the blam, blam, blam!
Long Beach, popping pill on 'em
I been working so hard, nigga, get your bale on
I been working so hard, nigga, work to sell somethin'
I been working so hard, welcome to the hellzone, zone, zone
See I'm from Long Beach

[Hook: A$AP Ferg & Snoop Dogg]
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up (remix)
See I'm from Long Beach
Fuck that shit, we get turnt 'til the sun is up
All of you niggas get burnt when the gun is up

Hey, Joyde! Hi, twin!
Thinking 'bout my goddamn father again
Why he couldn't see a nigga in Medusa lens
Why he couldn't see a nigga cop his first benz
Why he couldn't see a nigga pop his first band
Only bitches love me tryna get up in my pants
Riding in a limo with a bunch of fake friends
Who be only around me cause I make ends
I feel the pain for my bro cause his dad died
My daddy gone too my nigga, that's life
But them niggas did it up in they past lives
Moët with Crystal nigga, that's right
Bet them niggas dressed up in them white suits
Rhythm and the blues in a white coupe
Spit it through a cloud with a nice boo
Daddy, Anna-Nicole probably like you
Ahh, I'm so vicious
Riding in a coup with a bunch of killas
Are you gangbanging, man? I couldn't see it
Like twisting up your fingers in a pair of mittens
Put 'em in the water with a bunch of fishes
Watch a frog leap were his fucking chin is
Are you popeye? Eat your fucking spinach
Bunch of young Trap Lords and we down for sinning
A$AP Soul, that's my fucking nigga
Young Tarzan, that's my little nigga
Crawling in them bitches like a caterpillar

Headed to the telly with a bunch of Kelly Clarksons
They love that I'm from Harlem

And that rose gold keep the dome sloppy

Choppas all test tap dance, hammer time Ham dance

Mad faced niggas with anger issues
Hundred mad niggas got a gang of pistols, blaow

[Intro]
Ugh

[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was a minute with my grandma
I would tell her how I made it, listen to me grandma
Security wasn't workin', he failin' his job
He look at God
And I got a call from Universal like "hey this Ferg?"
But Rocky told me if them labels call just curve
I'm sittin' here like "damn Rocky you got nerves"
He got us this far so I'ma trust his word
Then [?] call me "what's up homie?
Got a deal for you like 2 mili"
When Rocky asked get money
Too much money, this half only
Two mil, two mil, I don't know
Grandma I ain't lie
Then Geno called like (?)
Got a deal for us like 3 mili at Polo Grounds
That label deal A$AP Worldwide, this shit unreal
Now we signed signed it
Grandma, now we signed it
Wish you was here to smell this air
And I could touch your pretty hair
We could talk for two more years
Push you around in your wheel chair
Momma say hi
"Hey mother, dear"
Your birthday on Christmas
And we shed a tear like every year
Celebratin' your happy years
Hopin' that your spirit clear
When (?) feel it you can touch my nose and brush your clothes
Light flickerin' from the chandelier
You see she blew that candle near
What you don't know you shall feel
But I know my grandma, I ain't scared

[Hook]
Grandma
I'm talkin' 'bout my grandma
Grandma

Talkin' 'bout my grandma

[Verse 2]
Grandma ain't gotta go through pain no more
Arthritis and pain and sores
Bleedin' red, they paint your gauze
Many nights you pray to God
Lord help me, I can no more, I can't endure this pain no more
What about my husband? He want more
Can't stand up cook, can't stand at all
Times I heard 'em down that hall
"I heard you down that hall"
It was times I heard 'em down that hall
"I heard you down that hall"
Don't be slick you fucked that neighbor
Tell me lies, you tell me fables
"You really think I'm stupid?"
(?) I hate you
Take advantage, I'm disabled
What about time I fixed your table
All of them times filled your naval
Coulda had a guy that fixed that cable
But I know you and I love you
Yeah I love you, you spoiled motherfucker
Fuck them other bitches sucker
Let them other bitches love ya, bitch
I'm good and know my kid love me
The only reason why I still really wanna breathe
Even though you love me unconditionally
And I understand the circumstance when it come to me
(I'm sick)

[Hook]
I'm talkin' 'bout my grandma
Grandma

[Bridge]
All I ever wanted was you here with me through all this shit

[Hook]
Let me sing my song, if you feel this shit, mothafucka sing along

Young Trap Lord, feel your pain, I be down for my people
Drinking Jesus juice, jeans hang low, rare rubies and the gold

[Verse 1]
And we sip, cause we hurting
Pull a chrome fifth when they murk them
Then murk off in Excursion
All cause a nigga be lurking
Big money shit we earning
A bunch of hooligans need churching
I'm the Hood Pope, these my children
And I'll be their Donnie McClurkin
Gold teeth when I'm smirking
Bunch of little kids running 'round need nuturing
Lord know that I ain't really perfect
All of these clowns run around this circus
Lord please what is my purpose
Besides fucking these Persians
Popping these bottles and popping these models
Please tell me where is the Sherman
And I'm smoking my weed, put me in my zone
Demons chasing me, cause they want my dome
And I carry the heat, and I sleep with the chrome
Cause I'm in some beef, and they want my dome

[Hook]
Let me sing my song, if you feel this shit, mothafucka sing along
This the Hood Pope, chain hang low, red rubies and the gold
Young Trap Lord, feel your pain, I be down for my people
Drinking Jesus juice, jeans hang low, rare rubies and the gold

[Bridge]
God say "Son, you don't wanna go down"
Now you praying in that trap when you hear that gun sound
God say "Son, you don't wanna go down"
Now you praying in that trap when you hear that gun sound
God say "Son, you don't wanna go down"
Now you praying in that trap when you hear that gun sound
God say "Son, you don't wanna go down"
Now you praying in that trap when you hear that gun sound

[Verse 2]
And I told you, told you time again
That ain't you gon' find your friends
You talking about you riding with them
And fighting with them, those ain't your friends
You dying, lying on cement, momma be crying "Don't take him!"
Gotta be trying, but he said "I promise he won't, ever again"
God, he was a little child, he was a good kid for a while
He found the streets and then it got wild; God, I promise, never again
God, he is my only child, please awake him so he smiles
But all she hear is lonely sounds, now he won't talk ever again

[Hook]
Let me sing my song, if you feel this shit, mothafucka sing along
This the Hood Pope, chain hang low, red rubies and the gold
Young Trap Lord, feel your pain, I be down for my people
Drinking Jesus juice, jeans hang low, rare rubies and the gold



[Intro: Dj Drama]
Let's get it right
New niggas is coming to eat up all the food
(Gangsta Grillz!)
Man they hungry
It's an appetite for destruction out here
The mob is equipped with full-armed artillery
What ya gon' do?
(DJ Drama, fuck these niggas up!)

[Verse 1]
I was born in Harlem where them things pop
At the block parties, niggas had to run
And they caught the motherfuckers on the same block
And they all at the war with the gun
R.I.P. Lil Na , Sharon, why they kill ya son?
Damn it, if I could've did it, I'mma hit 'em with the ton
Clit-a-dick, little-dick, feeling shit, hot in you lungs
Turn you bitch niggas to a couple nuns (lay 'em down)
I came in the store and saw the whole thing
He said, I hope that you not one of them
Then I run around the corner, got the OG's
I told 'em, We got jumped by a couple punks
I swear to God, these niggas softer than the Brady Bunch
They gon' get it, man, this shit been goin' for a couple months
Then turn around the corner, seen a crowd looking stunned
With the all shaking on the floor, not saying nothin'

[Hook]
This just where we from
We all dyin' some day
At a picnic having fun
Probably dyin' by the gun
This just where we from
We prayin' every Sunday
When the killas gonna come
She about to lose her son, son

[Verse 2]
Let me D bop
Spanish nigga, everybody thought he black (From the block)
Used to wear a tank top with a fresh fade
OJ, kinda fat, (OJ give low)
Face stay greasy pollo all you eatin'
Thug nigga with the Cuban on the neck
Always carried a tech, Dominicano
Trappin' the bando, Orlando, he was Diablo in the flesh
Dimelo got into a little mess with D Bach
And he shot up the block with the Desert
'Bout to leave him messy but the bullets hit the belly
You could call me Hollywood, not "the hood Tyler Perry"
Niggas making movies, more niggas getting buried
Niggas died, Desert, but this shit ain't really necessary
Caught up in the life, he got rich and got blurry
He took his own life and the one that he married, Ferg

[Hook]
This just where we from
We all dyin' some day
At a picnic having fun
Probably dyin' by the gun
This just where we from
We prayin' every Sunday
When the killas gonna come
She about to lose her son, son
This just where we from
We all dyin' some day
At a picnic having fun
Probably dyin' by the gun
This just where we from
We prayin' every Sunday
When the killas gonna come
She about to lose her son, son



[Intro: Crystal Caines]
See this is Harlem, these our streets

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Grandma used to call me Mickey Mouse but I’m no rat
On the block they threw a couple bullets, Warren Sapp
Seen my nigga’s family members buggin' off the crack
Your uncle smell like shit like he got garbage in his ass
I’m from 143rd, I come from Hungry Ham, ya heard?
Where the pigs'll lay you down and make a nigga bite the curb
Them kids is poppin’ Percs because they claim it cool they nerves
My crazy ass neighbors sprinkle (hoo hoo hoo ayy!)
Street name was Sterlin, smell like shit, vomit, urine
When my bitches come over they have the look of concerning
Like why he stand in the hallway with a milk carton and be lurking?
Why he jumping for joy when the whole building was just burning?
What about that nigga’s sash? Wore the socks on his hands
Purple coats in the summer, with the Glock in his pants
And he stabbed his own mama, how you do that to your fam?
Cause my block full of lunatics, call my shit Hungry Ham
Damn!

[Hook: A$AP Ferg & Crystal Caines]

Aunt: Yeah! Like he could be a rapper or something like-
Mom: Darold gon' get his ass beat!

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
My auntie ask my mama, “Did Darold quit his job?”
I seen him three days straight sitting on a car
My mama screaming, “Darold, c’mon, you ain’t quit yo job!”
Mama yes I did (Darold! Hoo hoo hoo ayy!)
My mama barking like doggies in front of my aunt and my shorty
I tell her, " I am a rapper", she suck her teeth and ignore me
All she see is my gold teeth with a white bitch and some 40's
I’m getting fame on computers, she don’t think this shit is for me
I used to pray for more women, now I get dozens of oldies
When I be hittin’ it doggie, she bark like hoo hoo hoo!
(Oh my, I’m horny!) Only when you want sex you callin’ me
Tellin’ me how much you want me but I think you’re full of baloney
I ain’t stressin’ you shorty, my shorty be stressin’ me, shorty
Claimin’ I’m messin’ with shorties and be undressin’ them shorties
I ain’t get no head from them shorties
Ain’t be in the bed with them shorties
Now what these condoms for?
And please don’t say these Magnums is for me

[Interlude]
Girl: Are you serious, what the fuck is this?

[Bridge: A$AP Ferg + Crystal Caines]
I'm-I'm-I'm-I’m from Hungry Ham, y'all ought to know
Better get your ass another plan if you want to blow
Can’t play this corner for no more summers if you get my flow
We catching meat, but y’all niggas is buns, hoo hoo hoo ayy!

[Hook: A$AP Ferg & Crystal Caines]

[Outro]
I’ll be back! (BLAH!)



[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
We could fly to Puerto Rico and fight a mosquito
Or lounge out in Cuba, even though it's illegal
Blowin' Cuban cigars, keepin' everythin' on the D-low
Or brag to your friends, "You never been here before?"
Baby, I love you, we're celebratin', I love you
Been doin' them squats, your ass tight as a glove
Fly like a dove, nobody fuckin' with us
I got the mean pipe but you supply me the drug
The pookie in New Jack City, the booty and tig ol' bitties
Blowin' the color purple like Danny Glover and Silly
Versace embedded in me, all of our clothin' silky
God took his time 'cause God damn, you pretty
And I just really wanna hold ya
I'ma make you say "Uuuh" like a No Limit soldier
Then ride her like a roller-coaster
I'ma beat, beat it down like a real man's supposed to

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Girl, it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And do some things we've never done before, yeah, girl
And baby, this a celebration to our love making tonight
'Cause I love you, I love you, babe, yeah, I love you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Look, house on the water like a casino
Vacation on private islands, notifyin' my P.O
Margiela the peacoat, pockets full of Doritos
Countin' all these Euros, they're like what the fuck is a C-Note?
Yachts with the clear water, it look like my chain
Cameras flashin', paparazzi, yeah, that looks like the fame
3 M on my jacket, you can't see me the same
Motivated, I'm avoidin' the lames but I'm lookin' for you
Ha, pretty brown nice thing
Rolex faces, bottles in them gold cases
It's ridiculous, with your body a nigga particular
That booty is big enough, she move it, I pick it up
Slow down, baby
Know a nigga singin', we gon' make some Motown babies
Ha, a nigga change the weather when I come out
If it's raining, baby, I'ma bring the sun out

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Girl, it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And do some things we've never done before, yeah, girl
And baby, this a celebration to our love making tonight
'Cause I love you, I love you, babe

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
You know I love ya
And I'm gon' love on you every chance that I get
Yeah, and ain't no way that I'm going to walk away
And throw it all away, oh yeah
And girl, I won't lie
And all that I get it, if you're mines I spend it on you
And every time that we fight
We just fuck and we make right back up

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Girl, it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And do some things we've never done before, yeah, girl
And baby, this a celebration to our love making tonight
'Cause I love you, I love you, babe
Girl, it's you I'm ready to settle down with
And do some things we've never done before, yeah, girl
And baby, this a celebration to our love making tonight
'Cause I love you, I love you, babe

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Flyer than a motherfuckin' propeller
Pretty bad bitch that's old yeller
Finna fuck a clip out for fellas
Get it crackin' on a bitch like a old leather
Toupee'd on a bitch like an old fella
Souffle on a bitch cause my dough better
Used to go to Mickie D's with no cheddar
Now my chauffeur I get fuckin' so feta
Now let's go to Sue's Rendezvous
Most of your crew be strange dudes
Two bitches like déjà vu
Blowin' that skunk like Pepé Le Pew
Make it hot in here like Nelly
Make her side burn like Ashanti's 'do
Murderin' Ink like I'm Irv Gotti
Fuck around and sing like I'm Ja Rule

[Hook: A$AP Ferg x4]
Sing like I'm Ja Rule
Fuck around and sing like I'm Ja Rule
(Where would I be without my baby?)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
It's the player you heard of, the young and assertive
I came from the dirt up, and did the unheard of
Hoes say I'm the man, mm-hmm I concur it
I'm young and perverted
If I don't get the pussy or the payment, what the fuck is the purpose?
Don't call on my phone, unless you're the fam or my girl
I'm a just say it's no service, stay connected as cursive
I bet if you put my name on it that I make it bigger
She saying she wanna take a picture, I let her take a picture
But don't send it to me 'less it's fuckin naked pictures
Feel me, I'm into safe sex-y, latex-y, rubber stretch-y
Good weed, no stress-y
You can get your broke bestie, show your chesties
Tell your boyfriend to stay off my testies, lil bitch
What he tryin' to say?
Make that 9 shake, pump up the crime rate
Pump up the value, make that bitch vibrate
Pump up the alcohol on the hydrate, she thirsty
And that's a damn shame
Red bone, white money, blue dream that's my campaign
I order Hors d'oeuvres, roll up more herb
I hit it, I bust, and throw it to Ferg, for sure

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Fuck around and sing like I'm Ja Rule, hah
Fuck around and sing like I'm Ja Rule bitch
Aha, Sean Don, ASAP Mob nigga

[Hook]

[Outro]
Baby, what would I be without my baby?
What would I be without my baby?
What would I be without my baby?



[Intro: Spice]
This is for the real hood niggas in a bandana
Hold on, I might ful dat. We bad gurl no need a partial we too used to steel with the best genital, unique motherfucker ain’t nothin normal, pootie pie lil' boy test your potential

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
It’s a ring
It’s a ring
A little Fergenstein with a little Shabba Ranks
I train a Jamaican girl that love the Cuban links
Got ‘em wining like Lil Kim in bikini minks
No limit soldier with a bunch of little tanks
Hit him where it hurt, make a nigga feel the pain
Blood stain of what remains for two gold chains
White dude, little guns, white cocaine
Rari and Jaguar take up four lanes
Out with window like, nigga money ain’t a thing
Bitches on my dick so I let the ho’s swing
Put my thumb in her butt like like I'm fucking bowling
Couple bad ho’s I’ll be free falling
Don't smoke now 'cause it's too potent
Most I do is a little codeine
Couple jolly ranchers when I'm pouring

[Hook: Bunji Garlin](x8)
Couple jolly ranchers
Hood nigga in a bandana

[Bridge: A$AP Ferg](x4)
Out in Trinidad with a bad ho

[Verse 2: Spice]
Back it up unless I push it like a trolly
Shape like barbie dollie, big dick make me jolly
Some gal a lick the lollie and a stomp inuh the alley
But no boy can play me like a monopoly
Couple jolly ranchers, watch me do my thing
Hood niggas in a bandana wanna be my king
Madame of the club have my two hip a swing
This’ll drive ya crazy, I’m a one night fling
Give it to ya once I know you’re gonna reminisce
Tell me if ya like this go ahead give it a kiss
Body perfect, it’s up there by the A-list
Spice, Bunji, A$AP Ferg, rock for this

[Hook](x8)



[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Nigga smoking cigaweed stressin'
All my sons feeling neglected
Woke up in the strip club flexin'
I want all the girls on my erection
I'm thankful to God that I'm winning
So I ain't gotta talk to you peasants
T Ferg out of jail and he with me
You know that shit is a blessing

[Hook] x4
Uh-huh (Uh-huh)
Yeah-huh (Yeah-huh)

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Nigga smoking cigaweed stressin'
I'm guessin' no nigga like me put in that work like a Mexican
All these bitch niggas be hype off they estrogen
Fergie so sick he changed up his medicine
Ain't gon deny, I be so fly
Put the heat in the street and it ain’t no mirage
Can't you see with your eyes, I'm the new [?]
Need a bad bitch like Nicki to have a menage
Sorry Safaree, she got some thick thighs
No game like Atari, when a slice of that pie
Shoutout to Bari Vlone on the rise
2 thou for the hoodie, toast to the god

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Marty Baller]
(Marty, finish 'em)
Feeling like I'm bout to turn it up
Tell the DJ I said turn it up
Cause I come from a place where niggas don't sleep
They selling that white seven days of the week
All night to stay on they feet
Then they hunt in the night like a thief
Cop guns cause they stay in some beef
Then they ride with them guns in the street (All the time)
My niggas be uber the Jeep
Personal driver whenever we creep
Guns gon fly open whenever we meet
And I'm grabbing them guns out the seat
Cause I heard you got it for cheap
Got it for low, and we trying to eat
With my flow, I could rock you to sleep
And knock them birds off in a week
We ain't come for no games
Now my niggas ain't playing
What the fuck is you saying?
Motherfucker y'all paying
All them hammers is spraying
All your bodies is staying
Y'all niggas ain't show me no love
I remember they tried to act tough
Now when I walk in the club, I light up my weed, and them niggas they all want to puff
What the fuck is that stuff?
We don't rock like that, and ya niggas really ain't gon pop like that
They not like that, they don't fight back
Tell 'em shoot and them niggas give the Glock right back
Them bitches they all used to front
I tell them to lick on my nuts
Then kiss on my shit, then spit on my shit
Then smoke it up just like a blunt

[Hook]



[Skit]
Now like I was saying
I used to go into motherfucking, um, Bomber's Club on Convent
With slacks and shoes on, with the TEC-9 on
Just - you know what I'm saying? Just scoping out for a bit
Yeah, Psych, you used to have the TEC with the good pants
Ya know we was just hungry like that
Too tired of shooting in the air ‘cause I can't get my way and shit

[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Grandma hid that hammer in her mattress from my uncle
He would listen to Wu-Tang 'fore walkin' in the jungle
Army fatigue jacket, kitchen knife, hope he don't cut you
With a deuce-deuce up in his boot in case he get in tussles

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
(And he will)
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
(And he will)
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
(And he will)
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
(And he will)
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Lightpost workout, how he turned out
Granddaddy tried to help him but he burnt out
He screamed, "Lazy fucker, won't you try to get a job?"
Block party where the hoochies turned out
They would dance and sweat they perm out
If they scream, "We got beef" he would handle with no prob
Cologne and liquor was his odor
Fragrance of a ridin' soldier
ODB was his persona, he was high on Mars
40 ounce and then some marijuana
When grandma died from pneumonia
Now his life a roller coaster, put that shit on God

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
(And he will)
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
(And he will)
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
(And he will)
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
(And he will)
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Bruh, I miss my crackhead uncle
Sold him dope in by the bundles
Draw down on him, his own gun though
Fuck about family, where's my Hundo?
'Fore my clip go knock-knock zero
Fake nigga talkin' 'bout Q ain't real
18 slangin' that Coupe Deville
Young nigga, young nigga move that dope
Young nigga might get killed
Cuz ain't payin' my bills, heat make the beef get grilled
12 years clutchin' that steel
Pop a nigga more than them pills
Pistol under sheet when I sleep
Body niggas like I do beats
I ain't talkin' bout my uncle, this me
Made another million this week
Swagger make a Bentley look cheap
I'm the reason why your momma OD'd
I'm the reason why your homies ain't deep
Now you wanna talk about peace
Pimpin' bitches all in these streets
Wonderin' why you rubbin' her feet
If you got high off what I sold
How his teeth platinum when he on shit row?
Big belly ballin' like I'm still gettin' throwed
Leave a nigga flat 'til his body get towed
Sad that the curtain got closed
Leave him with a hole in his skull

[Outro: ScHoolboy Q]
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
Uh, yeah

[Intro: A$AP Yams]
Trap Lord season begins, now repent your sins
This Yamborghini on the motherfuckin' check-in
You know I had to hang-glide through for this one
You know, we at the all-star game right now
Eyes closed (swish) shootin' fade aways from half-court
(elbow in the rim and all that)
(y'all still in the D-League doing, uhh, layup drills)
Ya feel me?

[Hook]
Kill a motherfucka with the Magnum .44
Find a chump slumped, nigga, magnum on the road
Body full of bullets when they found him on the road
Lay a fucker down, spray it at him then reload
This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go
The semi-auto tech, spray it at him then reload
This that Fergenstein and I be down to let it go
The semi-auto tech, spray it at him then reload

[Verse 1]
Ride Maybachs like Ross (Ugh)
550 Benz 4 doors
Praying for my niggas, they lost
Dying no thing, they wolves
Riding on a gang that floss
Multiplyin by the gang that bucks
Pull a 9 on anything we spark
Ménage ain't a thing they whores
Pussy so good, need more
Let me get in those drawers
5-0 in the corner store
He heard all them claps with a round of applause
Spit at your back and you lie on the floor
Rat-a-tat-tat and you go see the Lord
Bitch like horse, X In Her Pores
Want more sex, all in her jaws
Molly!

[Verse 2]
I'm grippin' the Mac and you under attack
Spit at your back and you taking a nap
No heart a be pumping, your body relaxed
You talk to me dumb and that's how I react
One arm in the air like I'm waving a cab
The 9 is a bitch and she making it clap
I'm palming a 5th like I'm giving a dap
Be ready to scrap when you talk to the Trap
My condolences
You are now talking to a boss
Lou Bang still ride in the Porsche
2 Thou for the grill, they cost
White gold teeth, no floss
Young Trap Lord like Doss
2 bitches in the crib, no drawers
She rocking the mic with her jaws
I call that bitch Nicki Minaj
She pop one pill no cough
When shit get real she spark
Givenchy, my bitches bought
Smoke that life till you niggas see God
Getting head in the foreign cars
Get the head from the foreign broads
Hasta la vista, señor
Pussy ass niggas a see Allah

So it's like, "Fuckin' Problems," platinum
(bling, bling) LongLiveA$AP number one album in the country
(bling blow) sold out tours, what's next?
Trap Lord
Let these motherfuckers have it
Let them know we not playing this year
The limb's never been so relaxed, ever
It's lonely at the top; all this shrimp, nobody to share it with
We ain't trippin' though
Y'all walkin' 'round with wrinkled silks, looking crazy, nah mean
Pay your dry-cleaning bill and all that (pay that, pay that)
Cause it's like it ain't even a competition no more



[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
She questioned my lyrics
My love for your music is bittersweet every time that I hear it
Your great-sounding art helped build my walls
And pushes me away so I won't fall
I'm thinking in my head "shit, oh my lord"
She texted me last night with all my faults
Downloaded your mixtape, it sound so good
But why you gotta say things that make me sound so small?
You talking 'bout your experience with other women
How you think that be looking?
My daddy and whole family hearing
Where's the respect? I don't feel it
And if you lose me, would you fear it?
Would you take back the silly acts that you was sharing?
About how you deceived and cheated with no caring
The honesty in your music is fucking overbearing
I feel you, babe, I understand where you coming from
Just hear me out, just understand where I'm coming from
I'm not dumb, I know what I write
I don't wanna hurt you and I hate to fight
I'm conscious of everything I recite
Cleanse the soul through fingertips when I write
I don't really know if it's wrong or right
I feel like God put me here to shed the light

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
You ride for me
You lie for me
You would die for me
And you cry for me
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
My open letter to my girl who got my back
Who's affected by the real shit in my raps
What's that name of the song, the Jay Z track?
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon' get right back
Still tryna figure my place in this world
Ain't mean to hurt the heart of my beautiful girl
See, I talk about the real so my niggas'll learn
Try give 'em motivation so my niggas'll earn
So I talk about how I shine and fuck on dimes
Rolling in the Maybachs, seats reclined
I know it sounds kinda harsh when I speak 'bout mine
And you'll be crying in the dark and wanna leave sometime
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
You ride for me
You lie for me
You would die for me
And you cry for me
But I don't ever wanna let you go
Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years

[Outro: A$AP Ferg]
You ride for me
You lie for me
You would die for me
And you cry for me

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
I ain't never had shit
Not a pot to piss, window to throw it out of
Sherm got me high get your ass in the shower
Took one pull, shit told her it wasn't sour
Hit a double drum chant getting louder
Chant getting louder (louder)
Mulan bitch wanna fuck for an hour
Start sucking dick bitch enough of the powder
Come fuck with this bougie nigga
Come fuck with this bougie nigga
High fashion Ksubi nigga
You fuck with them booty niggas
Cause you fuck with them booty niggas
Now Fergie all up in your groupie nigga
Reincarnation of Master Fard
Elijah Muhammad reside in my heart
Diss and I'll blow, and shouts from Allah
Knowledge was born with science young lord
Trippin' yourself is no valish young lord
Study your scriptures and follow your God
Life in the trap I know times will get hard
I'll pick up your life just abide by the Lord
Or ride by the Lord
Abide by the Lord
Abide by the Lord (alright!)

[Verse 2: Flesh-N-Bone]
You bout to get it from a general, I don't know if they can hear me though
Don’t you niggas ever bother trying to see me, I'm a criminal
Oh Lord once he's in the sight of the scope
I'ma let them have it when I sever them
Damn he wants to make me set it off
I'ma bury you motherfuckers without a coffin
Never taking no shorts, we never taking no losses
When your dealing with my crew, A$AP, Bone yeah we bosses
Anybody with a bone to pick
I'm going to level my charge, I'm damn sure to make it stick
You must be looking to suffer, well I'ma make it quick
Gotta train roll the ish that’ll make ya sick
I'm here to wipe em out quicker than a pandemic
Bone came original now they get me, can you dig it?
Hell yeah they can dig it while I'm sitting on my throne
Steady laughing at you niggas trying to get it, get it, get it

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Man I'm runnin 'til the end of this
And I don't give a fuck if I was 86'd
A muthafucka play me like I'm Canibus, I'm ready for the battle like a Pagan is
I'm never gonna take it in and nobody can break it in
As-salamu alaykum for the bacon and a little bit of coke
I put the cake in and it's certified dope
Having anything to do with it, we selling every rock that they can smoke
So take a toke and I'ma rake it in, Pillsbury the dough
To the dome like I'm seeking through the soul
Like I'm peeking through the soul
But I'm reekin like our reefer, rather keep up with her, go straight to the dro
Creepin' on 'em, peepin' on 'em, leave 'em in the zone
They don't even really know
Looking on 'em, keeping on 'em, taking every foe
For the love of the money I gotta reap in what I sow
But I keep it what I know for the ending of the row, gotta go, will I go?
When I get it I'ma know to follow my known foe
Know Cali and know Coe, my caliber lock and load
Alabaster box when I cock and I crow
Got a Glock and I'm Bone Thug where you wanna flow
To the clock and the time zone
Spirit gon' fly, all y'all niggas dead to the life force cyclones
Right now when they hydro
What about the well known Cairo?

[Verse 4: Layzie Bone]
Got em stuck in the grave
I'm on the grind full time, never rest to get paid
A little hustlin' muthafucka put the brush to the face
I cut the braids, hit the stage now they looking amazed
I went from cookin the yay to hundred thousand dollar shows
Gotta bookin' today and I'ma split it with my bros
Gotta get it how we go, come meet me with the pros
Now I'm never gonna fold, watch the bank account grow
If it ain't about dough, then it ain't about jack
And I'ma take it like I want it, I ain't giving it back
I get us in with a stack and then I get on attack
I'm like the Tasmanian Devil, nigga bigger than Shaq
Call the reaper, get the shovel, I'm a certified rebel
In a league of my own and that’s a whole nother level
Nothing's free, I never settle, keep the pedal to the metal
When them haters in my rearview, hello, hello

[Verse 5: Krayzie Bone]
Burnnn! Baby let it burn now it’s my turn
I get in a nigga's system like a hundred vials of sherm
And then I kill em with two thousand words in two minutes
You never heard another nigga spit it like my niggas
Yeah but you heard em try to get it but they couldn’t get it quicker than the realest
Man they thinkin they can deal with this and knock me out my rhythm
But I’m never gonna be the fuckin' victim
Cause I’d rather be the suspect, haven’t I given them enough yet?
Can’t they understand they ain’t dealing with a punk bitch
One quick move and it’s murder
And I’ma serve a nigga exactly what he deserving
A$AP, but wait a minute
I'm prolly one of the sickest niggas that ever did it
I’m in it cause I’m a win it
I’m a muthufuckin' lyrical tyrant, pivotal giant of this shit
And I do way more, just twist the words
You better listen and observe, how I rip the verb
Niggas get the nerve to run up on me but my shits superb
I’ll probably hit a nigga once 'fore he hit the curb
So get at me, I’m kinda trigger happy
When it come to shootin' my gift, I’m like a .44 magnum, stag one
Backin' em up, body bag full of niggas
Wack raps, that’s wack so I’m stackin' em up
Kray Jack in the cut, still got a little bit of murder for em
Murderous poet, I create a bloody murder poem
So when they run up on me, nigga be ready to show em
Redrum redrum redrum redrum rum rum

[Outro: Bizzy Bone]
Yo, before this, project
We’d like to thank the most high
On behalf of the A$AP Mob, Bone Thug and, all in attendance
Knowing that all things belong to those
For the cleanliness and the power the first in the nation
To prove who they are
Through infinity, through eternity, through time span
Standing one man, if you hold my hand, hold my hand
(Make sure it's a hand)
With all things around me I will never win
I won’t win with angels, I won’t win with the brothers
I won’t win with Rome, I won’t win with Sodom and Egypt
(I keep a corpse close to my home)
Let us roll tell them why we did what we did, if we did
In Jesus name, Amen

Some say I'm possessed, that's why Christ on my chest

Disrespect, I lay you to rest
Boy you ass, you softer than breast
Bloody murder, I lay you to rest
Aim for the head ain't no need for a vest
Can't nothing protect you from this tec
Street educated, no use for G-Tech
Niggas be talking but really don't want it
Put shells in your stomach, like pussy you wet
Flocka like Rambo, I stay with the ammo
Test me, that's a gamble like Russian Roulette
I stay with them commas, I been through the drama
You going to war, you better invest
Fuck is a K? I ain't impressed
Got thousands of shooters I pay just to flex

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & A$AP Ferg]
Niggas say I'm real, bitches say I'm hot
Disrespect the Mob or Squad, then you get shot
We don't dial 9-1-1, we don't fuck with cops

Ain't afraid to murda something, ain't afraid to murda something
Ain't afraid to murda something, ain't afraid to murda something

I smell pussy, them niggas hurt your cousin
All my people say "Stomp!" like I'm Kirk or something
Put 'em in the dirt like "Work" or something
He get on my nerves so fuck him
You turn ass like Tahiry when I pressed your buttons
And that was no diss, niggas quick for discussion
Y'all quick for the tweeting, y'all quick to be tumbling
How about a Vine, 2 clips to your spine
And Instagram pics of me dumping
I'm feeling your bitch so I'm fucking
I skeet-skeet like it's nothing

All my niggas down to murder

I'm finna get buck and start bringing the burner
Now I'm beating that ass like Ike did TurnerYou sit in a box, you sleep in a hearse
Wherever you from, that's my turf
Fergie Ferg and I'm putting in work
Young Flocka Flame gon' put 'em in the dirt
Sipping on the Henny and a nigga go berserk
Couple bitches gave me brain, then I skeet on they skirt

Pay attention, focus on what we came for
Got the drop on a nigga, got the info
Soon as I hop out then go click-clack, then go bang

Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Used to be sleeping on itchy beds
Bed bugs in the motel, now your bitch give me head
Twenty bitches in the hotel on a ramen noodle diet
Tour life wasn't so well
All my niggas starting riots, moshpitting on your toe nails
Uncle T doing so well, first class from a old jail
T Ferg did fifteen in the feds, getting no mail
My daddy died and my cousin too
They didn't let them out of no cell
Provide jobs for my whole block, I cannot slow down
Nigga, I won't stop now, mothafucka this is my town
Take the block, make it hot now, 143rd with the drop down
Icy chain with the watch now, third piece full of rocks now
Niggas squint when they watch now, leveling up to the top now

[Hook: A$AP Ferg + Future]
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level

Bought me some new bezels, all my niggas put in work

[Verse 2: Future]
Bought me some better bezels
Man and went to see my jeweler, woo and I re'd up
Went and bought some new jewels
Hit the car dealer, woo-woo re'd up
Who knew we would blow up like nitro, now these bitches need us
Woo I just tasted molly on me, Lord knows I just re'd up
Dib and dab in this some new designer
I just dib and dab with the semi tucked
You on the red carpet surrounded by pop stars trying to act tough
I gotta Actavis on me, nigga, and I po'd up
They say that we couldn't smoke in this bitch
And we fucked around and still rolled up

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level

Daddy looking down, I know he see me blowin’ up
My grandma would be so proud
Up in Heaven, Yamborgini, know my brother see me
I'ma make my bro proud
Tell his mama I'ma take her outta work
Know that I'ma hold my bros down
A$AP till a nigga die
If you didn’t know well you know now
I gotta get in my zone now
I gotta get in my zone now
Only a couple-a more down
Momma gon' get a new home now
Teach Marty Baller how to be a boss
So none of us ever go broke now
I'ma bring you to the water swim nigga
I cannot bring you the boat now

Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work

[Outro: Future]
My wardrobe is Tiffany Stones
I'm really putting on
Talking back to a King bitch, does not get condone
I'm on a new level
That means I just caught me a new check
I got them new bezels
Then I went and bought me a new tech

Ain't sayin' no names, who you foolin' now?
Ain't tryna see TMZ out my newest house
Take your pics of my bitch in her newest blouse

[Hook: Crystal Caines]
Now your pockets swole
But when you was broke
You was trying to touch and go
Nigga watch your code

Booty swole, nails and toes

Booty swole

[Verse 2: MZ 007]

Now my pockets heavy like my weight nigga
Bout to take a OC to the face nigga
And you know I’m always rappin' ‘bout some real shit
And I keep a real nigga I can chill with
Me and Ferg on the track, we bout to kill shit
Princess of hip hop they gotta deal with it
And on my momma right hand on the Bible
I ain’t tryin’ to be a rival
But I’m coming for the title
Nigga, princess no barbie
Fat chick, ride the 808 like a Harley, bitch
I stand tall no hard dick
I’m important now I’m on the red carpet
Killer weed have you niggas in a coffin
And Saint Louis is my motherfuckin office

[Hook: Crystal Caines]

Loaded with shells I pop a shot and leave you with a face lift
Remove your body from the scene down to my mama's basement
The fuck I'm wasted, a load of sins to send to Satan
Patiently waiting, upon my time to greatness
I know you hate this, cause I'm a winner one of greatness
I rep this A shit, that's to death ain't no replacement
Fuck you Twelvyy, Fergie, Rocky, all you niggas ain't shit

[Hook]

[Spoken w/ Hook: A$AP Ferg]
This nigga is a jealous ass bitch
Yo mike, this nigga's a bitch
Yo Nast, my nigga I love you and all but
You be trippin' some times

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg & (A$AP Nast)]
Wake up, hear the story
Cause Nast was starting to bore me
We had a couple of shortys, it was two with the orgy
(Aaw here this nigga go with his fuckin' story)
I was in Russia, don't you ignore me motherfucker
We had some motherfuckers, types of bitch to fuck your mother
And fuck your brother
Hol' up, the little one
Type to lick his booty til' the doo doo come
(What type of shit this nigga on)
She nasty, but I fucked her anyway
If you like me in Russia any day
I used a condom, it ain't like a nigga went renegade
And Nast was cuffin'
He wanted to take the bitch on a little date
And it comes to find out, his black ass couldn't even penetrate
(So what I caught the fuckin' head
I heard she had aids, so I'd be motherfuckin' dead)
You motherfuckin' devil, I'ma tell Rocky
Like "I'ma kill this nigga, and don't you try stop me"
Hold on, you got a gun, you gon' really try to pop me?
(I don't give a fuck if yo ass kinda stocky
Yeah I'm the cousin of Rocky, I'm supposed to be first
Now say your last words, rest in peace DEEFERG
And you's a bitch nigga, you don't put in no work
But nigga I do, you get put in a hearse)
Get that gun out of my face
(Pussy motherfucker yeah your ass is the worst
And Twelvyy he aiight, but his ass gettin' murked
I'ma kill all you A$AP's in due time
So you can rot in hell with your mildew rhymes, motherfucker)

[Skit]
Nast put the fuckin' down
Put the fuckin' gun down my nigga
Watch out Mike

[Verse 1: Dave East]
All black strap, I'm straight
Jewish lawyer got my case
Stars in the roof, white Wraith
Dice game, crack my bank
Out of town with a hundred pounds, Bobby Brown
Back then, I ain't drink
Head shot leave a nigga stink
Gettin' guap, fuck you niggas think?
Rollie on, lot of diamonds in it
Back account, lot of commas in it
Mansion, I'ma put my momma in it
Ask around, I'm intercontinental
I was in the rental with a seven
No concealing, you can see my weapon
Count a million, never see me stressin'
Ten or better, never any lesser
Who you know got it like I do?
I know the trap and I know survival
I already killed your main bitch
Tell her best friend she could die too (ahh)
Only foreign when we slide through, huh
I blew a check on the fit
Look at my neck and my wrist
I wanted a million before I hit thirty
So now I can flex in the whip
What are you on? I ride with a bomb
You gon' think Flex in the whip
I got respect off the rip
I got no respect for a snitch (no)
I'm talkin' incredible shit (yes)
This Sprite got a medicine twist
It ain't hard to tell that we rich

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
I feel like Olympian, I'm runnin' now
'Cause I'm runnin', runnin', runnin' to the money now
I be gunnin', put the dick up in her tummy now

I feel like Olympian, I'm runnin' now
'Cause I'm runnin', runnin', runnin' to the money now
I be gunnin', put the dick up in her tummy now
She in love with the crew, she with my buddies now

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Used to say I dressed so strange
Now I'm in the Wang, campaign
Jiggy, ain't a damn thing changed
'Bout to cop Cam, pink Range
Huh, yeah, I'm on a new level
Certified gold, at work with platinum
Already put mama in the house
Now it's time to build Fergie a mansion
Pelle jacket with the Trap Lord
In the back of the Marc Buchanan
I was nine in Versace
Wore Gucci with the Vans then
Used to Harlem Shake with the big shirts
Now my diamonds do the dancin'
My life is a movie, Steven Spielberg, Ferg
Nigga, light, camera, action
Mackin' bitches from a pageant, put that pussy in a casket
Tell Serena that I love her, fuckin' on my tennis racket
I could live in her palace, prolly put her in some Palace
But I'd prolly fuck it all up with a Love & Hip Hop ratchet
Huh, now I'm a loner, fuck 'round and blame it on Mona
Rich but I still love me a hood Dominican bitch with a Corona
Flexin' with a Tec and all the weapons, that is not your persona
My flow is hotter than a sauna, makin' all you rappers bipolar

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
I feel like Olympian, I'm runnin' now
'Cause I'm runnin', runnin', runnin' to the money now
I be gunnin', put the dick up in her tummy now
She in love with the crew, she with my buddies now
I feel like Olympian, I'm runnin' now
'Cause I'm runnin', runnin', runnin' to the money now
I be gunnin', put the dick up in her tummy now
She in love with the crew, she with my buddies now



[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
When you get the money, all your bitches be the baddest

I love to hit it, but she always soaking up the mattress
Yeah, I'm a one night savage
When you get the money, all your bitches be the baddest
Finna hit the dealership and pick me up a gadget
I love to hit it, but she always soaking up the mattress
Yeah, I'm a one night savage

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
T-Nice used to be bagging up the dandruff
Make it disappear so I call 'em Uncle Magic
Pitch on the jets, swear that's my only tactic
Want a jiggy nigga so I poke it like a cactus
Trap lord, Pelle Pelle rhinestone jacket
I'ma kill a pussy, put the kitty in the casket
When she skeet skeet, it be leaking through the mattress
I'm a one night savage

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
When you get the money, all your bitches be the baddest
Finna hit the dealership and pick me up a gadget

[Verse 1]
Trap Lord on my belly, free my nigga Relli
Elijah smoking that smelly, ménages in the telly
Blonde bitch named Shelly, dick all in her belly
I met that bitch at a fashion show, she was rocking Margiela
I was with Quasey Casey rocking all that Versace
Might be in there sailing, smoking all that Beijing
Ten stacks in my pocket,  for no reason I got it
Fuck around and hit Sin City, tell that bitch to pop it
What's up with you and Purrp? I ain't into all of that gossip
He brought the funk into my crew,  you gotta ask Rocky about it
All I know is A$AP riding in them Maybachs
40. cal, we spray that, when AK brratt you take nap
Oh, Lord, that Hood Pope - oh, Lord, that Trap Lord
Why they call you Trap Lord? Cause you a rap lord to my casket
I ain't bowing to no time, Hood Pope on my gold shine
My dirty niggas wanna tote nine, but we talk rhyme
I tell 'em hold up

[Hook]
All I know is that Trap Lord, that Hood Pope
All I know is that Trap Lord, but you're a rap Lord to my casket
All I know is that fast Porsche smoking that good smoke
Model bitch who from Brazil, she want it on her culo
Riding 'round the city feeling like P. Diddy
Glock 9 in my silk shirt, nigga, no Pac and no Biggie
Riding 'round the city feeling like P.Diddy
Glock 9 in my silk shirt, nigga, no Pac and no Biggie

[Verse 2]
No reply when you call Lord, mama cry 'til her throat sore
Liechtenstein when I drunk four you was dying in this war hall
Body left near the staircase courtesy of the whole mob
Don't mean no fucking thing when I pull up in that Goyard
Shooked up from that toe star, ask questions like Nardwuar
Like can you feel your fucking legs? I bet that nigga cannot walk
Persian bitch stack coke hard, sniff white 'till her nose soft
I fucked that bitch with no rubber, cause that bitch be so raw
Puff-puff when the semi pump, nigga really gonna pop
Trunks when you see me duck, niggas really want
Y'all punks can't see the God trap, Trini' Lord
And I click like Donkey Kong when I hit this long
Better run when you see the mob, you be seeing God
Hear the drum when my niggas march, you gon' see Allah
You the son of a bitch nigga, you daddy a broad
You a bitch, little bitch nigga, probably wearing bras

[Hook]



A$AP Ferg: Oh good money, you chillin' after that?
Chris Brown: Ayy I'ma be in LA the whole time
A$AP Ferg: You remember when I used to sell you the belts?
Chris Brown: Hell yeah! Man that shit crazy, man
A$AP Ferg: Yo you know it was me makin' them belts?
Chris Brown: No back in the day, you know, I ain't peep it. I remember, I think, I think Kwasi and them like brought you over one day and I peeped you, then they went off in your shit like when you was doin' the music. I was like... huh don't I know son? Like I know him! Then they was like yeah my nigga, he was designin' mad long. I was like damn that shit crazy
A$AP Ferg: Word, that shit was like five years ago - you still got them shits?
Chris Brown: Bro I got them joints at the crib, bro. I got the multi-colored one, the camo colored one, like I think it was red and brown
A$AP Ferg: [Laughs]
Chris Brown: And I got the camo joint you did
A$AP Ferg: [Laughs] Hey, now look, now we're doin' songs together and shit



[Music Video Intro: Juicy J]
Ride with the gang, ride with them things
Put a nigga thoughts outside of his brain
Got a bomb on the gas, Garrison Lane
For these kinda bags, you gon' need a crane
I remember comin' up from Memphis in the trenches
Northside, hoppin' fences to ride Benzes

[Chorus]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Verse 1]
Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'mma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo hoe if yo bitch keep eyein' me

[Chorus]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Post-Chorus]
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'

[Verse 2]
I'ma explain why you probably never seen me
I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D

[Chorus]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Post-Chorus]
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'



[Intro]
Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Ah, it was all at the park
Cologne and liquor was his odor
The fragrance of a riding soldier
ODB was his persona
Oh you want the power don't yah?

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
I got an uncle and his name psycho
He had a dance and they scream "go psycho!"
He would dance, work out and fight your ass at the park
(For the bills, for the hundred dollar bills)
And he got two sisters preggo
He fucked the other one to get one jel-o
And he took both kids to the ghetto ass park
(On the hill, shit'll get really real)

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
He used to have the braids with the cuts in his body
Most thugged out, kept the hammer with his mommy
Grandma had the arthritis pain in her body
Kept the burner in the mattress, so her son don’t catch a body
Danced and he danced, smoked crack with his posse
Front flipped through a building window, land in the lobby
He was cut like Bruce Lee but he didn't know karate
He came home bloody screaming "nobody can stop me"
Nobody can stop me, I'm the baddest survivor on this planet
Fifty niggas better kill me, nigga cause I will do damage
Checked out the psych ward, I am nothing to manage
My life cut deep, nigga I'm nothing to bandage

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
I got an uncle and his name psycho
He had a dance and they scream "go psycho!"
He would dance, work out and fight your ass at the park
(For the bills, for the hundred dollar bills)
And he got two sisters preggo
He fucked the other one to get one jel-o
And he took both kids to the ghetto ass park
(On the hill, shit'll get really real)

[Bridge: A$AP Ferg]
Where they be drinking forty ounces
With the brown paper bags for the ounces
No matter what day you found his ass at the park
Hungry Ham, fuck around and get killed
When he got kicked out of his bitch crib
And he had nowhere to lizz-ive
Always find his ass on the benches laying at the park
After dark

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Don't get it confused Uncle Psych, I love you to death
Just wanna get a couple of things off of my chest
Growing up you always was buck-wilding with stress
And though I'm older now, I don't know how to forget
I used to wear your Timbs around the house when you left
And if you had an open soda, I would finish the rest
Pretend I'm older, I like the liquor odor you left
Then put your camouflage vest on like I'm holding a tec
Then point it at the mirror like I'm holding your rep
Through that mirror wasn't me, but it was you I reflect
Wanted to be like you, jail tat on the chest
With the rugged cornrows and a stab on my neck

[Outro: Spoken]
I'll rob shit like that you know, cause I'll rob anyone, I, I don't care. It was a 9 to 5 for me, you know. It was like a hobby to me, I was the gun man, I was the dancer, entertainer, you know what I mean? I did it all. Like I said I had a deathwish, I'll rob anybody. Aye hold up motherfucker you see I'm talking right?



[Hook 1: A$AP Ferg]
What you feel
Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Now what you feel
Don't want you to run away from me honey
I want us to grow old

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
We talk about art then end up on sex
We text for hours, you're so complex
Not your average girl in spandex
Who chase Bent-e-leys and Rolex
You wear them baggy jeans like Aaliyah
Your body so mean, I can tell you got a booty like Selena
Girl, you're 'bout to have me catch a fever
I can't lie, I get happy every time a nigga see ya
The way you move, the way you groove
Is so appealing
I'm usually not that dude caught up in all these feelings
I've been around the world and dealt with all these women
Through all these different girls, this is the realest feeling

[Hook 2: SZA]
I'm tired of the waiting (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it
I'm tired of lonely (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Sort of afrocentric, you been thick
Pearly white teeth like you live at the dentist
Impeccable freckle, you put a spell on nigglet
Room full of syringes, she got me addicted
Body authentic, how do you bend it?
Got her too tempted
I don't know how to prevent it
I will go into it, party 'til I go limp dick
Run in that clitoris, like I'm in the Olympics
Swinging that diznick, til it's all in appendix
She be likin' it nasty, I like when you rinse it
Rinse it off like candy rain
Say my name three times like Candyman
Oh, cause our love so so real
That a nigga want to score like Shaquille O'Neal
And she fly like an eagle, so I call her Seal
Let nothing get in between what you feel

[Hook 2]

[Hook 1]



[Intro]
If I die before I wake
At least I lived life my way
Hope that you remember me
Came up fast, bittersweet
Please prepare me mentally
‘Fore you take my soul and empty me

[Interlude]
Now that you’re no longer a lord that’s trapped
You have graduated to the Hood Pope
You have made it to represent your people
Show them another way
Be the voice of the people who couldn’t make it out the hood

[Verse 1]
Make sure my family good, my ma still in the hood
I ain’t rich like they think cause I copped me one mink
They think I got me a house with a big couch and a gold sink
With a model bitch with a gold ring, big ass fish in a fish tank
Haha, you laughing, just put me in my casket
I ain’t even into nagging, it's what it is, I’m passing

[Interlude]
And though times is hard now, your success awaits them
I’m no different, we all the same
Ferg made it out? Well, I can play that game
You’re not exempt from the growing chain
Niggas forget who’s afraid to change
Yet a trapped lord, I will remain

[Verse 2]
Hood Pope, I’ma teach these confused folks how to maneuver
Through folks and attention, get you choked, you know
Slim model girls sniffing the coke
Fiend on the block sniffin’ the dope
I wanna help, I don’t know, tell me the, antidote
How you hood and a pope
Conscious thinking, ghetto though
I’ll teach you how to build a grow tree
Life like a bike and pedal slow

[Interlude]
Now you’re the voice of the guys on the corners
And the kids who have no direction, guide them
Through the trials and the tribulations
Teach them the world can be accumulated with patience

[Outro]
If I die before I wake
At least I lived life my way
Hope that you remember me
Came up fast, bittersweet
Please prepare me mentally
‘Fore you take my soul and empty me



[Hook: M.I.A.]
Kill a motherfucka with the AK, what it's for
[?] on the board
[?] kill em when we forced to let it go
Bodies in the gutter, M.I.A. gon let it go

[Post-Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Unh, I'ma let it go
Watch a nigga drop slow
Bodies flying everywhere

[Verse 1]
I grew up when niggas got put in walls
This ain't The Wire with Omar
No HBO where the show go up
Go Google “Preacher”, then holla at your boy
No job applyin'
Just pa-lyin
Hunt niggas down like Private Ryan
Shit mighta got hit playing in the street
Look out the window, he dead in the street
Dead, casualties in Harlem
Draw guns like galleries in Harlem
No life, they'd rather be in coffin
The right is wrong, what the OGs taught em
Get down!
That's what the police taught em
Come with the van, they scooping all em
Little hooligan with the Smith on him
Old lady upstairs was snitching on him

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Crystal Caines]
I'm from Harlem, where it’s eat or be eaten, and either you're doing or die
Put the metal on your spine
Transforming these niggas just like a young Optimus Prime
Heh, I'm in my prime
Can't see what the [?] been grinding all of my life
No time to recline
This a jungle bodies found in the gutter submit to you rhymes
And you (I BBQ)
[?]
It's Trilligan
You know we don't play with rap
And you know not to play with that
My robe chinchilla, hoe
My pockets a [?] because I'm working hoes
Unlock and unload and reload, now his whole body get froze


[Bridge]
Let it go
Let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go
Let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me

[Hook]
[Post-Hook]

Coke up in they nose, that's why their nostrils got that red look
Hip-hop police saw me, jiggy nigga make the Feds look

Killa, Killa, Killa, Killa

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Yo, in front of the Waldorf, valet said that he's sick of us
I mean he just can't get wit' us
"What's the problem playboy? It's only six of us"
"Yeah, with twenty-five cars, this shit's just ridiculous"
Thought we was inconspicuous
He said, "Yeah right nigga, y'all meticulous"
Twenty-five to life, at one time I was risking it
Ten digit nigga, old life I ain't missin' it
Look at me, baby girl, you should just lick a bit
Bend down, real low, my zipper come unzipping it
Yeah, I think I really love her 'cause she started kissin' it
I mean, she really started kissin' it

[Hook: A$AP Ferg & Cam'ron]
Rubber band man got the pocket with the bankroll

Short nigga but my dick tall

Only thug nigga down at the Pitchfork
Dirty van bitches wanna suck my dick off
Pop a Xanny for a penny
Get to hit floor, run up in this shit raw

Skinny nigga but my dick long (Pause!)
Stank puss make my dick soft
Probably bumping R. Kelly sipping Cristal
So you know the whole world getting pissed on
I don't really give a fuck if you pissed off
I just bought a Mac-11 from the thrift store
Traded for my gold chain and my pistol
Shoot a rocket make a mothafucka lift off
(Let's go)
Flacko be mobbing all day
With niggas that's chopping that yay
They chopping them choppas they handle my problems
Cause niggas be plotting these days
But the 'Rari kinda fast though, she told me pump my brakes
You stuck with a fat ho, and she wanna stuff her face
To all of my Dominican girls dem, all of my Caribbean girls dem
All my West Indian girls dem, I done fucked a million girls, damn

Hit her with my ding-a-ling-a-ling, maybe run a train
And tell her that my niggas wanna bang and a little brain
And she wanna hang with the gang with a nigga named (Shabba!)

Walk in this bitch with the new Wang, looking like Liu Kang
With a blonde bitch that wanna snoop cane
Then she get the Batman like Bruce Wayne (Master Bruce)

I don't give a fuck what you say, my whole team like a parade
Twelvyy got bags of the haze, Illi be smoking all day
Me and Rock run trains on the ho, he be like "Bitch, don't touch my braids"
Ty Beats in VA putting producers in graves
Yams got a bottle of Henny, going straight to the face
Ty Nast got a bad ho, but she's tryna come my way

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
You can be you today, you can be you tonight
Know you're feelin' really great, it's gon' be alright
I can see it in your face and I know you wanna fly
So get off your ass and create your life

[Post-Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Cause you're missin' opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
And you're missin' opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Workin' in Ben & Jerry's, it was scary
My life vision was blurry
You got talent, why's you here?
I'm thinkin', "Yeah, plus I am gettin' a belly"
I remember mama screamin'
"You ain't gon' be like your Uncle Terry"
Uncle Terry on the corner sellin' rocks
He don't care what you tell him
He a hustler, bad muddastrudda
Ridin' in a brand new Lex when he pull up
He got a hood bitch from the block in the winter
He pull up on her like, "Baby give me sugar, mane"
Man I wish I shoulda, coulda, woulda
Woulda put a hurtin' on her if I hit her with the wood up
She got me dreamin'
When I get outta the hood, I'mma get me somethin' better

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
You can be you today, you can be you tonight
Know you're feelin' really great, it's gon' be alright
I can see it in your face and I know you wanna fly
So get off your ass and create your life

[Post-Hook: A$AP Ferg + Missy Elliott]
Cause you're missin' opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
And you're missin' opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
In VA, where I stay
They don't play, they'll tell you that to your face
Collard greens, candied yams, potato salad
Before you grub, better say your grace
Auntie Jean was kinda mean, but she had dreams
She used to sing like Tina Turner
She said, "Bring my wig and bring my dress
My high heel shoes from a Sunday mornin' service"
Aye, she said, "I'll show y'all beginners"
I'll still whoop that ass with a switch and a splinter
Pray for these tramps runnin' round like a sinner
Missy wanna be a star? Well tell her she's a winner
Ayeeee, she a bad lil' sumn'
Love how she dance like Michael Jackson
Told me I would be number one
Just be yourself, don't be nothin' like them

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
You can be you today, you can be you tonight
Know you're feelin' really great, it's gon' be alright
I can see it in your face and I know you wanna fly
So get off your ass and create your life

Cause you're missin' opportunities
I know you're rich in opportunities
And you're missin' opportunities

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Picture me in the club, all the models around, big
Tip for the bottle girl, all the bottles around
Just bought me a brand new Bim', so I stunt when I come around
Fuck all my enemies, I'ma stunt when I come around

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Hunnid swipes, got a couple hundred off a swipe
Swipe, bought a Bentley off a swipe
Swipe life, got two Rollies off a swipe
Swipe, oh, holy moly, swipe life, swipe life

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Stolen identity, whenever I put it down
Fuck all my enemies, whenever they come around
My homie done did a year, nigga you held it down
So I bought him a brand new Benz, now he stunt when he come around

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Hunnid swipes, got a couple hundred off a swipe
Swipe, bought a Bentley off a swipe
Swipe life, got two Rollies off a swipe
Swipe, oh, holy moly, swipe life, swipe life

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
My goons all in that van
My shoes all in advance
My tools all from Afghan
Poppy seed residue on my hands
Sacrifice for my gang
You test me, know you're testin' my aim
I drop them bombs all in your barrack
Barack callin' my name
I just grabbed a new Benz
Took them stocks off of that thing
I put them 4s under that bitch
Got your bitch rockin' all of my chains
I been rich a long time
That boy be still droppin' that flame
Been rich a long time
That boy there still got the cocaine
I pay for the Cad', I might swipe the card
Then I may get head, or I might wipe your broad
I'm cutthroat like that, I cut dope like this
And since I'm always on your mind, can't forget I'm rich, bitch

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Swipe, got a couple hundred off a swipe
Swipe life, bought a Bentley off a swipe
Swipe, got two Rollies off a swipe
Swipe life, oh, holy moly, swipe life, swipe life

[Verse 4: A$AP Ferg]
Henny, Mo' up in my coupe
Skeet is all up on her tooth
Beeper goes off, I'm like, "Who?"
Why I go off in the booth
Better be watchin' your tongue when you speak
Don't even talk to me, please
I keep that banger on me
Swipe and get all of my cheese
I bought my mom a new house
I bought my bitch a new dog
I brought my trap to the house
Bow when you talk to the lord
I come through with a banger, nigga
And I put a big diamond on her finger, nigga
And you know all the bad bitches hangin' with us
Couple rappers couldn't even get a table with us
Couple hater niggas always tellin' fables on us
Guys stealin' money, turn the tables on us
But, fuck it, I'ma keep the money real tight
Cause I gotta keep a banger with a hundred swipes

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Hunnid swipes, got a couple hundred off a swipe
Swipe, bought a Bentley off a swipe
Swipe life, got two Rollies off a swipe
Swipe, oh, holy moly, swipe life, swipe life



[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about oppression
That's repressin' my peeps
Ride around in that green hooptie
With my Uncle T
NWA blastin', we screamin' "fuck the police" (fuck 'em)
Cause they don't give two shits about me
I mean we when I say Ferguson they talk about me
Little brown, Mike Brown
Shot down in Missouri
They keep us in misery
And get a desk job when the coroner leave
They don't even take they badge, a racist act
Just take a president to make 'em black
Hope that we live in bliss
And take a nap to create with the same brush that paint the past
Cause it's still the same shit
We don't run it up for no help
Cause you know we bound to get hit

[Hook 1]
All I ever wanted was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about these hatin' motherfuckers
Talkin' 'bout me
All I ever wanted was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about these hatin' motherfuckers
Talkin' 'bout me

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about hate
Hate in the game
Be the same niggas that you made your friend
You give me a beat, they ain't play it then
Then you run around town like you made my name
Showed you nothin' but love
Somethin' strange deranged
Just wanted to see and make some change
What about old friends that claim I change
I ain't changed, I'm grown about my change

[Hook 2]
All I needed was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about these loyal fans
That be talkin' 'bout me
All I needed was a Clams Casino beat
To talk about these loyal fans
That be talkin' 'bout me

[Verse 3]
Let's talk about fans
Are they fake or real?
They happy when you make the deal
They build you up to make the kill
To break you down, and claim you ain't real
"Why you do songs with these pop icons
Oh he moved on, dreamed the pay-off
Fly state to state, two white girls in his arms
Mr. Hollywood don't like us no more"
Nah, that's a lie
I like any girl with eyes, cutie pies
Fat ass, sumo thighs
Any complexion, girl you could be mine
I love the fans who truly mine
Respect the come-up, the Fergie grind
Man art can be art sometimes
Might fuck around and do a song with Bruno Mars

[Musical Outro]



[Intro: Kanobby & A$AP Ferg]
Makin' money for the long term
Off of these words
Yeah, give me one more, one more
We're gettin' more and gettin' more
We gotta get more, yeah
Make a dollar out of these words
And I'm just tryna find the real words
So I try to find an angle
Yeah I try to find another angle
So we can tango
I try to find another angle
So I try to find another angle
So we can tango with these words
So we can tango with these words
Yeah, real life
Ain't nothing like real life events
Now talk to 'em, yeah

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Just found out my daddy died for the wrong reasons
Wasn't the the kidney that took him, it was the bad treatment
Ain't go to court because our heart was still bleedin'
Family grievin', no money could fix the pain that we feelin'
Lil' nice, done leveled up, you wouldn't believe it
And my momma always reflect when I was younger teethin'
Now it's gold grills glisten every time the teeth in
And all my idols listen every time I'm speakin'
Timbaland and Missy lose it when I load the beat in
My life a party, everyday is a weekend
I swear my whole life changed last weekend
But this game strange, it'll throw you off the deep end
Speak to Yams' mom on the daily, beautiful lady
Feelin' of her losing her baby drivin' her crazy
She say that I remind her of her son
She make arroz con pollo and cook every time I come
I get the 'itus, she tell me to go sleep in his bed
And maybe some of Yams' visions come to your head
Life's a dream, momma knew that I was somethin' special
Never settled, tunnel vision, pedal to the metal
Momma in first class, she actin' all boujetto
Now it's PBS specials, thought I was too ghetto
Singin' Christmas carols with Miss Universes
She slide me her number, you know Fergie gon' put the work in
Re-real life, I be livin' out my verses
Reflect when Dove ran out, I used detergent
The one you clean dishes with
And now we at award shows all gettin' lit now

[Chorus: Kanobby]
Sometimes I like to tango, tango around these words
Dance all around these words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango, tango around these words
If I don't speak it might get worse
I'ma dance all around these words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Sometimes I like to tango dancin' with these words
But I can't accept my thoughts so it's gettin' worse
I gotta let it out or my brain'll burst
I'm busy tourin' so I can't go to church
The only option is put it in the verse
Express it to my fans so they be alert
Yeah, Fergie put in work, Fergie put in work
I wonder if I gave it up, would I miss the perks?
Would I miss the groupie hoes with the short skirts?
Would I miss these rapper niggas? Nah they all jerks
Some I came up with, don't desire to speak to
Fake hugs and love every time when they see you
They scream "R.I.P. Yams" and that's just to please you
But his mom know what it is, just know that we see you
I got the heart of a lion and the eye of a eagle
I gotta speak the real, it ain't no time to tango

[Chorus: Kanobby]
Sometimes I like to tango, tango around these words
Dance all around these words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango, tango around these words
If I don't speak it might get worse
I'ma dance all around these words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango

[Outro: Kanobby]
Dance all around this words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango, dance all around these words
Dance all around this words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango



[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Mattress, mattress, mattress
Mattress, mattress, mattress, mattress
Mattress, mattress, mattress

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Came a long way from the mattress
Boy, I used to jump on the mattress
And I used to hump on the mattress
My grandma kept the gun in the mattress
My uncle kept O's in the mattress
Flippin' the work like gymnastics
Pitchin' the crack, it do backflips
Po-po was flipping the mattress

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Psycho gun in the mattress
Grandma pass it and he blast it
I came on your bitch, I'm a savage
She stretchin' my dick like elastic
She made it disappear like magic
Bedbugs crept in the mattress
Came a long way from the mattress
Used to lay on a rug like Aladdin
Yeah, huh, now I'm like King Tut
You cuffin' that bitch but she smuttin'
She fucked the whole block, I ain't bluffin'
Trap Lord meaner than the mug
Wake the niggas up like Folgers in a cup
Tec go buh-buh
Don't ever let it get fucked up

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Came a long way from the mattress
Boy, I used to jump on the mattress
And I used to hump on the mattress
My grandma kept the gun in the mattress
My uncle kept O's in the mattress
Flippin' the work like gymnastics
Pitchin' the crack, it do backflips
Po-po was flipping the mattress

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky & A$AP Ferg]
Did backflips on the mattress
Did mad shit on the mattress
Where the magic happens? On the mattress
Two ratchet fat chicks on the mattress
A nigga stash G's in the mattress
Fuckin' all they bitches on the mattress
Bendin' all these bitches over backwards
LSD and the acid
Wrote mad rhymes on the mattress
Fuck mad times on the mattress
Only thing in my Margina mattress
'Cause I came mad times on the mattress
King size bed full of ashes
She smoke on my dick and don't pass it
I fuck mad dimes on my mattress
I fuck mad dimes on my mattress
Ass fat but her titty plastic
What can I say, man? I'm a jiggy bastard
Pretty motherfucker, I think I should join a pageant
For the salad, put a hole in his cabbage
Niggarace, new Versace 'Preme or the Palace
Fuckin' models, Flacko always schemin' on the talent
Cover of your favorite magazine and I'm stylin'
Fuck a horse-face bitch, but her body like a stallion
She swing on my dick like she Tarzan
Call me Coach Cartier 'cause I'm ballin'
My stones look deformed like retarded
What's the name? (Those Balmain?) How you call it?
She suck on my dick while I'm yawnin'
She missin' the D, now she moanin'
Her ass fatter than Action Bronson (pause)
She top me like top of the mornin'
Niggarace told me to, oh shit
Niggarace told me, give me Rocky
Cause you know it's Flacko Jodye
Icy papi, while you watchin', copy, niggas copy copy
I ride down, sloppy toppy
When she love a nigga mane, we them niggas now
International, had 'em going wild
Trap jumpin', nigga, block bunkin' nigga

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Came a long way from the mattress
Boy, I used to jump on the mattress
And I used to hump on the mattress
My grandma kept the gun in the mattress
My uncle kept O's in the mattress
Flippin' the work like gymnastics
Pitchin' the crack, it do backflips
Po-po was flipping the mattress

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Flacko always sleepin' on the mattress
Waking up late or even absent
Came a long way from the mattress
School of hard knocks, graduated with my Masters
See the kids jumpin' on the mattress
Came from the gutter where the trash is
We was sleepin' on the pissy mattress
Guess you could blame it on our inner-city habits



[Hook: A$AP Ferg](x2)
On this side kids do drugs
On this side kids gang bang
On this side better know your codes
On this side damu hang
On this side we talk slang
On this side we the hat gang
In the Bronx that's the mac game
That's what happened when OG Mack came home

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
The first time I smoked weed, it was with Bloody Rose
Skinny black motherfucker corn rows to the back
Had a knack to say brrrrrat
Had three cigarette burns in his arm, he wore a gat in his clothes
He said "I'mma be blood 'til the day I die Fergie when you coming home"
His little brother Donny was my best friend and he was a blood
And his daddy in the pen and he was too
And his mom ya ya even she was a blood
Donny had a set called LN-Dub they wore a burgundy flag to show their blood-ily love
For 31 seconds in an elevator baa like a hundred niggas
Go nigga rep your thug
They came back with stories like we just got a popping
Still breathing hard cause that Glock 9 was popping
They hear bodies dropping, the opposites dying
Your son is gone and a few mommas crying
You know I ain't lying, Ferg satisfying
Shit done got turnt up and bullets was flying
Couple niggas got burnt up due to all this violence
All you hear is the sound of the doosh doosh but no sirens

[Hook: A$AP Ferg](x2)

[Verse 2: YG]
Pop pop blllllrat rat
Tony mentioned he ain't the only one to get you smacked
On this side niggas got fat gats
Point them at the enemy and go bllllrat rat
Nigga nigga I'm from Bompton
If you grew up in the hood you got no option
If you ran into the hood then that's your problem
Hi mom I'm a blood now what you know bout it
On this side niggas getting DP'd
Get your ass whooped in front of all your hommies
This the type shit to have a motherfucking bitch ass nigga snitching on his homies
So I'm bicken back being bool (I'm bicken back being bool)
I'm bicken back being bool (I'm bicken back being bool)
Red everything Iphone cases to my shoes
Know all of my bloods say soo-woo

[Hook: A$AP Ferg](x2)

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Momma said Darold don't wear red it's a bunch of black boys cutting boys ear to ear
I went to Bloody Rose room we fucked the bitches there
I was only fourteen years old in that pussy hair
It was drawings of bugs bunny on the wall
With Yosemite Sam his gun was tall
Backwards clothes on like Kriss Kross
Man this shit is looney toon who did this shit dawg
I was gang affiliated like Shakur
Rest in Peace to who ain't make it man, I'm pissed off
They live by it so they dying by the pistol
And they hate to see a nigga pop crystal
Shit dawg every time I think about that shit dawg
I pour another bottle let the floor dissolve
Then glug 'til a nigga can't see shit
This is for my thug niggas who I used to be with

[Hook: A$AP Ferg](x2)



[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
15 years of my life, I was locked in prison
Thought shit would hold me down, but the clock kept on ticking
Time kept on slipping, plus I just got sentenced
Now my collect calls got your bills going ballistic
I should've been there taking care of the children
And I worried about all them snot-nosed women
While I was in Carolina flipping birds in the kitchen
You heard that wasn't the only type of birds I was flipping

[Hook: Tinashe]
I can make a thug cry, tonight
Watch me make a thug cry, tonight
Cause that's how true love is supposed to be, ain't it?
When it feels so good it shakes all your belief, baby
I can make a thug cry, tonight
(I can make you cry tonight, tonight)
I can make a thug cry, tonight

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Then I got married to you, Richard Porter didn't do it
He was too busy getting busy, all of which was foolish
I know you tired of all of my "didn't do it"s
All of my promises and all of my "I'mma prove it"s
You knew something was up when I all of a sudden took two trips
Two trips turned into too many excuses
I gotta hustle two more months, babe, just two flips
Meanwhile, you had me a child and he was toothless
I was living wild down south, had me a new bitch
Brought her ass a brand new car, lived in a new crib
Hmm, second child on the way, juggling two bibs
Then you got a call from shawty like "bitch, who this?"
This is why it finished, baby mama, he got two kids
Tell his funky ass that I'm leaving, fucking doofus
Afraid to come home cause I know what I did was stupid
And you still forgave my stupid ass, uh

[Hook: Tinashe]
I can make a thug cry, tonight
Watch me make a thug cry, tonight
Cause that's how true love is supposed to be, ain't it?
When it feels so good it shakes all your belief, baby
I can make a thug cry, tonight
(I can make you cry tonight, tonight)
I can make a thug cry, tonight

[Bridge: Tinashe]
There's something about you
Baby we got to get lost in the moment
You and me only

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
And now that I'm locked up, I expect you to stay
Like somebody coming to kill you and expect you to lay
You stopped sending commisary durags upon me
Guess you figured that other chick'd take care of my ways
Don't you forget you're my wife, like that meant something
Then blow kisses in the phone like that did something
Then you stopped my visits, heard you got pregnant
By that nigga, I just act like "y'all been fucking"
But I knew that wasn't true, you was just tired
And somewhere in your heart, my love sit higher
But a good man is what you desire
And this is what it sound like when a thug crying, I'm crying

[Hook: Tinashe]
I can make a thug cry, tonight
Watch me make a thug cry, tonight
Cause that's how true love is supposed to be, ain't it?
When it feels so good it shakes all your belief, baby
I can make a thug cry, tonight
(I can make you cry tonight, tonight)
I can make a thug cry, tonight



[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Yeah, yeah
Pray to the trap
Pray for the trap

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Send them niggas to the Hood Pope
My synagogue right in the ghetto
Off the dome, I'm killin' niggas
But the pen game on a different level
One trap with a big dream
I go hard, won't ever settle
"Go in for the kill" what they taught me
Boy I'm movin' that Shark Tank
In this bitch like I'm Clark Kent
Got a deal with the devil like y'all say
It's for the love of the money, what y'all think?
Fuck a wack bitch what I won't do
Make a bill with these vocals
And the Pro Tools, thought I told you
Pedal or metal, I try to slow down but I can't
Fuckin' yo bitch and she kissin' the dick
And I'm startin' to feel like I'm Tank
Chasin' the commas on commas
Embracing the drama that come with the fame
Put that on my momma, the llama’ll
Hit ya designer and pardon your brain, so stay in ya lane
Huh, yeah, I'm fuckin' your bitch in a park
I bust in her mouth cause she parched
She throwin' it back with an arch
You cuffin' that bitch like a narc
Ooh boy I don't wanna start
Two birds on my boat, I'mma start
I'm kinda like Noah's Ark
I am leaving this Earth with a mark
I ain't got time for you marks
I aim at your head like a dart
He lay on the street with a chart
Spike on his head like he Bart
I'd rather be chasin' the cream
Trappin' and trappin', I never be slackin'
I'm countin' a million a dream

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Trap and a dream, trap and a dream
I had a trap and a dream, trap and a dream
One trap and a dream, trap and a dream
I wanna make a hundred million when I hit the scene
Trap and a dream, trap and a dream
I had a trap and a dream, trap and a dream
One trap and a dream, trap and a dream
I wanna make a hundred million when I hit the scene

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, yeah
Trap and a dream, uh, Mac with the beam, yeah
Left Hollywood, damn, back to the fiends, woo
Pull up in my hood, skrt skrt, Maybachs on the scene, hoo
In the back like a spleen, hoo, hunnid racks in my jeans, aw yeah
Know a couple niggas want me dead in my hood
Do some charity, I put some bread in my hood
Pussy niggas snitchin', got the feds in my hood
It's like all the real niggas really dead in my hood
I been runnin' it up, fuckin' it up, plenty
Hop out the spur, jump in the truck, Bentley
Neosporin, I'm in the cut, chilly
Mask on, mask off, reppin' my set, Philly
I got thrity-six O's, we gone put it on a roll
That boy silent, never told, fuckin' models out the Vogue
And I rock a lot of gold, all these diamonds on me froze
I called papi for the low, he gon' drop it, Lord knows
I got a

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]

I wanna make a hundred million when I hit the scene

[Intro]
Let's ask a question of real life
How you gon keep it
You gon keep it trill
You gon keep it real
You gon keep it to yourself
Or you gon keep it away from what it should be
Ask yourself

[Verse 1]
You was devil walking I mean you never taught me nothing
Talking about you knuck if you buck
You walk through the block as if you was tough
You was always got fucked up
Oh, my uncle got stabbed?
Granddad, he never gave 2 fucks, claimed it was good for your ass
Oh no love from your dad, is that, the reason you act up
Grandma always spoiled you
Even kept your mac tucked in her mattress
How could you ask for trust?
You's a junkie smoked on glass dick and be holding glass nuts
Grandma was "Ma" and Auntie was "Sis"
She was my best friend even taught me how to kiss
You was in and out always get up in some shit
Quick to lock a door, while that blood is dripping from your lip
I learnt nothing from you, you took my chain cause you said it glist
I was only 8 I still loved you cause ignorance is bliss
You's a bitch probably in the bathroom rubbing on your clit
Claim you committing suicide, motherfucker then slit your wrist
I'm different from you, because you live to die and i die to live
Good riddance for you, cause you a handicap with nothing to give
Go fuck yourself cause you better off not having a kid
Got two sisters pregnant now they brothers and cousins and shit
Confused as fuck, a lot for a toddler growing up
No wonder why I had anxiety in school throwing up
You claim you know my life but you don't know wassup
All you know is keeping it trill and that fucking stuff (what, what)


[Hook: A$AP Ferg & (?)]
They walk back into my life (x5)
(They walk back into my life)
Don't walk back into my life (x5)
(Don't walk back into my life)

[Verse 2]
I wanted to be just like you
Wear Beef and Broccoli Timbs just like you
Army fatigue pants just like you
I wanted to get box braids be a man just like you
You had a move called the cycle I wanted to dance just like you
You listen to O.D.B. that was your idol
And that explains your drug habit he was a man just like you
Always getting locked up with no plans for life
You drowned your life with 40 ounces, contraband with pipes too
My chain wasn't enough, you even stole my bike too
Claimed you'd bring it back tomorrow after that I ain't like you
Always running to my ma talking 'bout you got a job
But you still begging for dollars for a fucking metro card
But I still love you uncle even though times is hard
I know you see me shining somewhere near the stars
(5,4,3,2,1) [Rockship countdown goes off]

[Hook 1: A$AP Ferg x2]
You see that floor right there? Put your weave on it
You see that floor right there? Put your weave on it
That floor don't look right unless your weave on it
That floor don't look right unless your weave on it

[Post-Hook: Crystal Caines]
Oh you look good, won't you back that ass up
You a fine motherfucker, won't you back that ass up
They call me big batty, won't you back that ass up
Girl, who is you playing with? Back that ass up

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
I was in Greensboro with about five women
Laying in bed, 'bout to fuck five women
Marty bitch choked cause she seen me in the linen
Put the Yoko Ono bitch like my name John Lennon
Tones got mad cause he wasn't really winning
Then he took his ass to sleep, that was only the beginning
He was tired, see, I swear
He was tired, see
I told them bitches "let's play a game"
Weave on the floor, ass up was the aim
Take clothes off, I'm about to do my thing
She make it disappear like her name David Blaine, I ain't lying
All the bitches got bucking naked
She threw that ass on me quick, wait a fucking second
Been playing with the guns so I'm bussing like a pellet
I'm fucking five bitches so a nigga acting reckless

[Hook 2: A$AP Ferg]
Beyoncé want you to put a ring on it
Beyoncé want you to put a ring on it
But that floor don't look right unless your weave on it
But that floor don't look right unless your weave on it

[Hook 1: A$AP Ferg x2]
You see that floor right there? Put your weave on it
You see that floor right there? Put your weave on it
That floor don't look right unless your weave on it
That floor don't look right unless your weave on it

[Post-Hook: Crystal Caines]
Oh you look good, won't you back that ass up
You a fine motherfucker, won't you back that ass up
They call me big batty, won't you back that ass up
Girl, who is you playing with? Back that ass up

[Verse 2: Crystal Caines]
Do it for my niggas, niggas always seem to notice
Niggas in the cut all of these bitches getting focused
She gon' pop that pussy for a G
The spotlight is on a 10, 20 inch D
I've recorded for my niggas just in case they wanna see
She whispered in my ear, she said that she a freak
Put my hand on her lips, told a bitch "don't speak"
Keep it coming like a red nose, shake it for a treat
Said oh my god, damn it, she remind me of a masterpiece
Cause her body 'bout it, yeah, we crowd around it
And don't stop, she what, what, drop it like it's hot
That ho over the top, definition of a thot
She a threat, a threat, [?]
Like she tryna give me head
[?] shake it till your ass shots pop
After you back it up, then drop

[Verse 3: Marty Baller]
I'm feeling like this one 'bout to pop
Feeling how Ferg was feeling when Work was 'bout to drop
Nigga, you know that feeling, that work you 'bout to cop
You paranoid cause they making you circle round the block
I jumped over you lames, I'm now hot
If I really wanted you dead already, you'd been shot
I ain't playing with you dames, I'm giving these fiends rocks
Spit it, I'm wicked with it, I cooked that up in the pot
Switching, twisting the floors, they wondering "will it stop?"
Started off at the bottom and ended up at the top
Started off with a dollar and ended up making gwop
All I had was a dream, been spitting since 17
Now I'm on all these [?]
And no, I ain't got time to diss you lame
Niggas, they ain't fucking with my pistol game
They want molly and coke, I bought Crystal Caines

[Hook 2: A$AP Ferg]
Beyoncé want you to put a ring on it
Beyoncé want you to put a ring on it
But that floor don't look right unless your weave on it
But that floor don't look right unless your weave on it



[Chorus: NAV & A$AP Ferg]
What do you want?
Cut my grass low, see the snakes, all in my lawn
Tell me what you want, got a party inside my trunk
What do you want? All my haters mad that I'm on
A$AP with XO, tell me what else do you want?
What do you want
Is it a car, with the stars?
Tell me what you want, what do you want?
What do you want?
XO with A$AP, tell me what else do you want?

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
She licking the tip, she put it on her tongue
She smoking my dick, she coughing up her lung
Please don't run, please don't run
She open her leg, I eat that thing for lunch
I get in her zone, I give her the bone, I tell her, "Let's have fun"
A couple of rounds, a 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1
They come to my house, that booty bounces like it's 3 to 1
Feeling my touch, fucking that bitch and she's licking my nuts
It's no love, riding that coupe 'cause she's filling my life
Baby it's my life, snakes in that grass and I tell you no lie
You ride or die, tonight
Don't tell me no lie, look in my eye

[Chorus: NAV & A$AP Ferg]
What do you want?
Cut my grass low, see the snakes, all in my lawn
Tell me what you want, got a party inside my trunk
What do you want? All my haters mad that I'm on
A$AP with XO, tell me what else do you want?
What do you want?
Is it a car, with the stars?
Tell me what you want, what do you want?
What do you want?
XO with A$AP, tell me what else do you want?

[Verse 2: NAV]
Try to diss me and take my lane, you won't go far
Got an ounce and the hammer wrist out my Goyard
Went from  papers to smoking by the jar
Just cause it's Japanese don't mean that that's a foreign car
Growing up in Southside Rexdale wasn't fun
Just happy walking on some people on the run
Shouldn't have a clean record with the shit I've done
I won't say shit cause I know how to bite my tongue
I flew Frost to L.A. when he landed, get whatever he want
I'm smoking by the pound, with him, I'm smoking by the ton
Gave him a diamond chain cause I'ma make another one
Switch your girl, she saw me in a Ghost, I asked her what she want

[Chorus: NAV & A$AP Ferg]
Cut my grass low, see the snakes, all in my lawn
Tell me what you want, got a party inside my trunk
What do you want? All my haters mad that I'm on
A$AP with XO, tell me what else do you want?
What do you want?
Is it a car, with the stars?
Tell me what you want, what do you want?
What do you want
XO with A$AP, tell me what else do you want?



[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
I gotta close the window before I record
‘Cause New York don't know how to be quiet
Stand up!

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Coogi down to the socks like I'm Biggie poppa
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
But really though, she a silly ho
‘Cause you know the Fergenstein gettin' plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window
So you see a nigga shinin' in the Benzo
Ballin', got me feelin' like Jim Jones, I'm a pimp though
No limp though, couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer, then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the building, semi gon' squirt
That's what a nigga get when they gettin' on my nerves
I ain't lyin', lay 'em on the curb
Ridin' on a killer who be comin' at Ferg (damn!)
Girl, you twerk, twerk that kitty, girl, make it purr
Put in work, Flacko put 'em in the dirt
French got the shovel, he gon' put him in the earth
Trinidad maniac with an all-gold hearse
Yeah, uh, put in work
ScHoolboy Q with a pound of the purp
So much work he'll smoke up the Earth
Polo Ground, A$AP World

[Verse 2: French Montana]
(Haaan!) That ain't Kanye
That's Montana, loose cannon
He shot me, so I had to do it
Put him in the dirt, put him in it first
I just sold a swammy with ten homis on it
Her ass fat, you could park ten Tahoes on it
When they mask up, comin' for your ice
When they bare-faced, they comin' for your life
Baby, don't pray for me, pray for the weak
I'm drinkin' lean, it help me sleep
Illuminati? I'm from the streets
Never sold my body, we takin' bodies

[Hook]
Put in work, put in work
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
Shout out that motherland
12-years-old with guns in hand
They don't ask no questions, nigga
All they do is bang bang bang
They don't ask no questions, all they do is bang bang
I said I do this for them shottas, Trinidad, I love ya
I do this for them shottas, Jamaica, I'm your brother
I know a bitch from VI
Yeah-yeah-yeah, that's my partner
You got a problem with it
Then-then-then-then that's your problem
I fuck with Asian niggas and I fuck with Migos
I fuck with Haitian niggas, all they speak is Creole
I said all I speak is real, y'all niggas might hate me
But that don't get no deal
I said no, that don't get no deal
I just now got my deal, but I been gettin' this money
No green card in this struggle
Immigration give you nothin' but work (put it in work)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
YAWK-YAWK, YAWK-YAWK!
A lot of niggas died, should've been from Hoover Street
No, I do not have a car, but I could buy one every week
Pimpin' like I'm 33, move keys like I'm 36
Ship O's like I'm 28
Tacoma know I'm pushin' weight
O-X-Y, I'm in your state
Eatin' off your dinner plate
My heart live where Santa stay
Super fly, I need a cape
Bitches throwin' pussy back and forth, they on my dick
Passion drippin' off her lip
She say she never had a Crip
Uh, put in work, all big booties make it twerk
All big titties lift your shirt
Show a player what you're worth
Yeah, put in work, spray his ass in front of the church
Deacon said I did my shit
The pastor said, "That nigga turnt."
Pop my collar on my shirt
Make these bitches go berserk
Shippin' units; Captain Kirk
Takin' xannies, poppin' percs
Might not last, I'll bomb you first
Turn your backseat to a hearse
Back to the lab with mother Earth
Had to give Young Ferg a verse

[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
A lot of homies cried, due to crimes, homicide
Drivin' by, poppin' nines, Pakistan, Columbine
Outta line, pistols barkin' *argh argh*, ride or die
Write a script, design a line, all I see is dollar signs
You want that pretty Flacko? Ratchets, designer jackets
The same niggas who jack it
Be the first who claim we faggots
My bitch is a movie actress
Side bitch won a beauty pageant
Got a chick that worked at Magic
But I'm so damn fine make a bitch look average
See, my daddy in Heaven, right next to Ferg's
You know what's up I'm throwin' bucks
Loaded Lux; put in work



[Intro: A$AP Ferg & Big Sean]
Yeah
Better get the fuck out my face
You always tellin' me I got the world
Talkin' all that shit
Bitch you better the fuck out my face
But I don't have half of what I want to achieve
Na-na-na-na-na-na, fuck is you sayin'
I got to get it

[Hook 1: Big Sean + A$AP Ferg]
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain’t true
And even though I want it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain’t true
And even though I want it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
But you know it ain’t true, you know it ain’t true
I’m tryna make a dollar, get my ass up out of Harlem
Cause you know the haters watching and the bullets ain’t cool
Ain’t you, attracted to a powerful motherfucker
Don't wanna be compared to these rapper dude motherfuckers
Who turnin' so passionate when they battling motherfuckers
But never get a crib up in Malibu motherfucker
And I don’t want to wind up like him
He can't afford that Tom Ford, you won’t like that man
Grinding that old food, no AC or fan
No trips to Jamaica, babe you gets no tan
I wanna pull up pull up in a 4-4 or Benz
A Sprinter van, with the TVs in
Your crew jump in, I’m getting those jeans
If we keep on, fuckin’ fly to Japan
You say that this shit mami, ‘cause you my girl
You say you just need me and need no one else
But I'm full of ambition to take over the world

[Hook 2: Big Sean + A$AP Ferg]
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
And I know its true
And even though I got it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain’t true
And even though I got it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Funny how it all go go, you never could know though
What happened to Tiger was Kobe, you know hoes
Get caught in a photo, lipstick on your polo
And all the trust that you builds right out the door door
Y’all went from lovebirds to looking like Dodos
And that shit gon’ last, for months it’ll go go
And that shit gon’ drag, drag on like komodo
Over a bitch that look like Quasimodo, god!
Now you calling and checkin' in
All the time like your ass still on parole though
Wondering if you just better off solo
You paying a price, but is that what it owe though?
Praying up to god about shit that’s not even holy
You like “she tripping over bitches saying that they know me”
Then she put the pussy on me, swear that shit control me
That shit control me, man that shit control me

[Hook 2: Big Sean + A$AP Ferg]
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
And I know its true
And even though I got it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain’t true
And even though I got it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose



[Hook: A$AP Ferg]

When you fuckin' with the mob, hit 'em in the jaw

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
All of my niggas bi-polar, lean in the pour up
Mix it with Xan, now you tore up
Runnin' with my gang, bumpin' that Keef in the hoop
It's motivatin' my soldiers
Don't keep the gun in the holster
Hide it in Tommy, hopin' they don't pull you over
Coppers on the block, tappin' on the Motorola
Gotta keep the fuckin' beeper on you
All of my killers is ridin' with me for the night, yeah
Flacko just hit me like he just landed from Dubai, yeah, yeah, yeah
See what's in the club, what bitches is fuckin' tonight, yeah
Is it you, you or you, you
If your man talkin' shit then I shoot like doot-doot-doot-doot

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
All of my niggas gon' riot, all of my niggas gon' riot

Blat-blatka-blat-blat

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky + A$AP Ferg]
Yammy Gang gang, say my name five times
Candymane-mane-mane-mane
Bitches on my hotline, bling
Thank you BasedGod, brang-dang-dang-dang
Me and Pac fuck the same hoes
Beat the pussy like the Wayans bros
Bang-bang-bang-bang like Chiefy Sosa
Flocka with the fuego
Run at any case, money be the case
Murder be the case, better call the lawyer
Try to beat the case, try to flee the states
Cry to immigration, nigga, thought I told you
Nut on her face, bought her shades
I pull up, pull all on her face, pussy get murdered every day, bruh
Yammy Gang, Yammy Gang, Yammy Gang
Yammy Gang, Yammy Gang, Yammy Gang
Blat-blatka-blat-blat

[Verse 3: A$AP Nast + A$AP Ferg]
Yammy Gang, Yammy Gang, Yammy Gang
My niggas set it on any man
2016, we got bigger plans
I might go bleach in that boo pack
I might go home but don't talk to me
Yeezus, Jesus walk with me
Last year bein' broke
If you ain't talkin' money, don't talk to me

[Verse 4: A$AP Twelvyy]
Yamborgini High
Diamonds in the rain, made the hall of fame
Prosper be the gang
Always gotta strive, I could never change
Word to Yams
I'll smack a nigga in his skinny pants, yeah
High as hell
Man I'm fly as well, do the Diddy dance

[Bridge: A$AP Ferg]
Yeah, Yamborghini Gang
Yammy Gang, this the A$AP Gang
Hahahah

[Outro: Tatiana Paulino]
This is for all my beautiful people around the world. My son was a genius. I wanna continue his legacy



[Produced by Hit-Boy]

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "DOO DOO!" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm mmm,"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it’s like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big KRIT]
Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist



[Verse 1]
Feeling outta place, plus it's getting kinda late
Tryna make it home safe and not get raped, where you live?
Tina tummy ache, Gina got the funny face
Mona's sniffing dope, so her dome is leaning on your rib
I bet you wish you had a Benz cause you just helped your friends
Flag a taxi, now you walking not too far from your crib
Craving for an acid tablet for your satisfaction
Said you feeling flabbergasted, you just had to have it
Made your way to 7th Ave, flagged a yellow cab
Now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
Black kid, french braids and he keep the potent
Hold ya purse don't trust him cause his teeth is golden
Dice rolling reefer blowing in the streets he smoking
Blowing weed while police patrolling
Acid strips, purple drink you can have a sip
Have a fix of this acid drip

[Hook]
Hands on her thighs, kiss on the lips
Eye for an eye, drip for a drip
I get ya high, please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya trip



[Hook]
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang

[Post-Hook]
I'm the dope mane, bitches sniffing cocaine
All my young niggas know that they could always
Call me, call me, call me (always, always)
Call me, call me, call me (always, always)
Call me, call me, call me (always, always)
Call me, call me, call me
(If you see me trouble, bitch)

[Verse 1]
They call me young drug dealer, they call me young thug nigga
24 karats my slugs glitter, 24 years old worth a couple million
Shouts out to my cuz niggas, finna let it fly for my blood niggas
Middle finger up to you fuck niggas, if you a trill nigga, then fuck with us
Nigga dash like a speed of a bullet
With a pistol on him prolly wouldn't even pull it
Heart made of pudding mean mugging with a hoodie like what's goodie
Trying to be the mothafucka that you couldn't knowing you
Down to let it fly when I shouldn't
All my young niggas they gon' rep it to the fullest
Tell a fuck nigga "be you," fuck tough be cool
All the young niggas in my crew, they down to let it fly

[Pre-Hook]
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me (They let it fly)
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me (They let it fly)
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me (They let it fly)
For a nigga like me, jiggy young nigga like me (Flex!)

[Hook]
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang

[Verse 2]
Niggas got rips in they jeans man I started that
Hood by air man I started that
Niggas claim they the God of black
Well your name is purple I'm the God of that
Gave you my back nigga pardon that
Fuck that shit I brought mobbing back
I brought robbin' back, I brought the Garden back
Motherfuck black land I brought Harlem back
Rolling in my Benzo, hoes on the curb a couple of friends
Rolling down my window, yo what's the word, fuck it get in
Ride round with these bimbos, she give head to my kin folk
Shout outs my connect though, keep a watch out for them Winslows
Cause the boys gon' creep, D-boys gon' serve
Hoes gone skeet and the V gone swerve
I'mma get by while the world gon' turn
I'mma get mine like you gon' get yours
Niggas do the least do when the piece got nerve
Niggas in the streets want heat, get burned
Tell a nigga "be you," fuck tough be cool
Couple young niggas down with my crew who be done and let it fly

[Pre-Hook]
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me (They let it fly)
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me (They let it fly)
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me (They let it fly)
For a nigga like me, jiggy young nigga like me (Flex!)

[Intro]
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I'm moving...

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
War Lords, we all Lords, but we your Lords
Tryna find home, next stop is the Waldorf
Past the racism and fake-ism
Type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim
Raw dogs, you other niggas mad soft, mad I rap my ass off
They throwin' mad salt 'til I go bath salt
On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off
I'm Mr. Miyagi in Issey Miyake
Asshole flow, fuck name brands, past logos
Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head so good on that girl that I might pay her, or nah
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone
Tell them lil' niggas Flacko home

[Hook: Acyde]
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uhh, Father, Lord forgive me as I load up the semi
Roll through the city, that chose to resent me
Hold it, don't load it, reload it on plenty
Any foe or a (*beep*) that ever voted against me, dissed me
Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated
Never hesitated, the designated, all of the wrong that they did me
Is stored in my memory all of the thoughts that I thought of
Means more for my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the henny, it's the best for the remedies
Energy, synergy, frienemies, industries
Finna get advantage on him and his nemesis, bitches been sniffing
If I, if I ain't the greatest, bitch I'm one of em
How in the fuck could you front on em?
My old ho beefing, my ex won't be friends
Bronson told me not to eat ham, rest in peace Yams

[Hook: Acyde]
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long

[Break: A$AP Rocky]
Rest in peace Yams, RIP A$AP Yamborghini
We gon' take it uptown one time
We gon' take em back home, show em how me do
They call me Pretty Flacko ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to introduce Pretty Flacko Sr
Yasiin Bey

[Verse 3: Yasiin Bey]
Magnum spectacular, black man megalas
Shine amethyst, fly champion, it's like that again
What's happening? Mathematics master blin'
Flacko season, all day, erryday
Ask me how it's going, I tell em on and on and on and on and
You led me out to Arizona, steady flowing, staying golden
Sand cover, ready rover, Flacko glowing in that Owens
That's how it's going
Gotta find my way back home
Huh, awareness to the areas, familiar with the routes
Travellin' man, moving through places
Space and time, in a country called Earth

[Outro: A$AP Yams]
Nah'mean? These tacky ass muh'fuckers be in the pictures
Wearing all types of motherfuckin' red and green stripes
Over accessorizing out this motherfucker
We from Harlem, we gave y'all motherfuckers this wave
Grab y'all surfboards, cause y'all got your boogie boards right now, fucker
Y'all just gon' keep watching us at the beach shore
With your motherfuckin' khakis rolled up
With your chancletas in your hand
And we just gon' keep surfing on this motherfucker
Straight up! It's ya' boy, A$AP Yams, Yamborghini
Yo Rock man, let these motherfuckers know what it is
Out this motherfucker, A$AP, bitch!



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
These other niggas so-so, they open off my mojo
Spanish Sophie with a half a kilo by her cho-cho
Blow it out your culo, who got dough on the smoke though
My partner had cinco now we blowin' on that ocho
Bozos love my rose gold, purple got me slow-mo
Stuntin' like I'm Dorothy but my rubies in my gold though
What you think this four for, these niggas must be loco
Steppin' on these bricks and for your fix so call me Toto
Follow me, follow me, follow me now

[Verse 2]
Now I'mma come through getting down
Got a new Cadillac with a diamond in the back
Got a bitch and she bad with about a hundred tats
Got my goons on deck, and we got a hundred straps
What you know about that, got me swaggin' to the max
Everybody know we got the shit and baggages to match
Better come correct, fuck what the basis is
Gold grills like a set of new braces's

[Verse 3]
Why they comment on my set though, they lookin' cause my neck gold
And I let that Tec show... hear that echo?
Let go, that medal, .38 special, to your threshold
Niggas actin' petro, like they sexual, was metro
Bunch of bad bitches fuckin' out on tour
Like it through the backdoor, give it to her raw
Shimmy shimmy ya: ODB, ODB
Fuckin' other niggas broads: OPP, OPP

[Verse 4]
Comin' down stuntin' like a bitch, bitches on my dick
On the set and they like the nicotine to cigarette
How they fiending for a nigga got these hoes up on my sack
Got my niggas in the back, couple bitches in the bed
ASAP where it's at, where that weed, how that cake
Bitches all up in my face, back back, give me space
Cas you know how we do it, niggas scream ASAP
Aye Clams nigga, tell me where that bass at?

[Outro]
Bass, uhh!!



[Intro]
Yeah, last track on the mixtape
'Preciate everybody listening, you know what I'm talkin' bout?
And we'll see you on the next one, you know what I'm talkin bout?

[Bridge]
Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
Not cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before, we make the perfect team
We barely get along forever making scenes
Your crying on my sleeve what does it really mean
It doesn't really matter to me

[Hook]
Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me

[Verse 1]
Now you can cry me a river or cry me a ocean
Maybe the Pacific, that's just to be specific
I gotta keep it pimping these hoes they say I'm tripping
I don't care about your nails and your new hair, do your lipstick
Dip-dip next ho, they be on my dick like
All on my testicles, I can't even piss right
After we fuck you won't see me again after this night
Real niggas know what I mean

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Now you can go go where you want front who the one gotta get that vibe
Did I hit that? Quit that? How did I hit that? Niggas know how I keep it live
Live try this suprised but she just say I'm on her eyes
Whenever get it in that Prada or Del Agua
Now I be the man Peter Pan, I fly high cause you like my drift
She know how I do it cause I got possess and I'm so swift
Get her girlfriend in this whirlwind how we spin
It don't really matter cause I'm pimping bitch until the end

[Hook]

[Intro]
Don't give a fuck about your man
I'm just seeing what it's hitting for (bitch I'm sayin')
How you fronting on the kid though?
You should fuck with me girl, you know what you need girl
See I got used to livin' life up on my own, yeah
And searching lovely for a wife to call my own, yeah
It's all I think about at nights when I'm alone, yeah
Swear that I can't get no rest in California

[Verse 1]
Swear that life is, just a whole bunch of vices
Niggas biting off of my shit, my dick
Stay up in your chick ride stick without a license
Tell her hold on like some vice grips
Might just call her, let her ride with a baller
Look up on her face was priceless
Wonder what my type is, well, tonight Mrs. Lightskin
With a light mix or a light switch, white chick
Darkskin complexion and she righteous
I take a dyke chick if she like dick
I kissed the dyke chick and I liked it
Fucking each and every Katy Perry for the night bitch, light this

[Hook]
Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it
[(Moving on to better things, I'm sure)
Bless, sit back and relax one time, clear your mind
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)
'Bout to send me back to my old ways, know what I'm saying?
(Moving on to better things, I'm sure)
Yeah, I'm just, she making mistakes
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)

[Bridge]
I've been puffing, rolling up
Cop a lot and pourin' up
Plus my niggas know the plug
A generation's thrown on drugs

[Verse 2]
I swear that bitch Rita Ora got a big mouth
Next time I see her might curse the bitch out
Kicked the bitch out once cause she bitched out, spit my kids out
Jizzed up all in her mouth and made the bitch bounce
Ride with a nigga mane, and you know
I stay fly like the jigga mane, and it figures
Cause here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man, anyways
Nowadays everybody's stressed, yes
Animosity is better off your chest, yes
Guess everybody want to stay blessed, stay fresh
Take a nigga threats, but I'm up next, take debts

[Hook]
Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it
(Moving on to better things)
Inhale, exhale, relieve your mind of stress, bless
Smoke some one time for your boy A$AP
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)

[Bridge]
I've been puffing, rolling up
Cop a lot and pourin' up
Plus my niggas know the plug
A generation's thrown on drugs



[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
You know these big mouth niggas don't know how to act. I got my West Coast connection. These dead in the street industry mothafuckas talking 'bout "We can't eat," talking 'bout "we brand new guys," tell them niggas "suck a dick!"

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I'm camo down to my boxers, gold teeth, a Bathing Ape
It's animals in my projects like monkeys, orangutans
Banana clip on that chopper, I hold heat, bangers bang
(Let Chiquita speak) Bet it keep the peace that Lil B, brrangadang
I don't care if you blue or you red flagging, hair swinging, my pants sagging
Hoes all on my bandwagon, your bitch gagging, she jet lagging
All my cuz niggas, what's cracking? All my blood niggas, what's popping?
I ain't set tripping, I just happen to know who click clacking, you mismatching
Fuck swag and you been jacking, fuck fly, I am fashion
Tryna cop that Benz wagon, my bitch drive it and my friends crash it
Niggas threat with the chit-chatting, see a nigga don't shit happen
I'm finna blow on that Bin Laden, so talk money, pig latin

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Brand new clip, brand new nine
Brand new bitch, brand new ride
Brand new weed, brand new high
Brand new me, meet the brand new guys

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
345 be the big toy, now which nigga want it with the fat boy?
Clipped-up like I'm paranoid, high as hell nigga, Fitzroy
Pull it off through the city like "errt"
Seen that ho nigga like "errrr," hopped up on a nigga like murk
Put that pussy nigga in a purse
You wouldn't be the first, cover him with dirt
Put him in the ground, he was down to Earth
Napped up nigga, I been down since birth
Backpack full of random work
With two bad hoes, I'll teach you how to jerk
Teach you how to jerk, swaggin' in my Js
Pop me a pill and throw that pussy a rave
My prerogative ways
Nappy chin hairs with the brand new fade
Brand new nigga with the brand new venue
Sold that bitch out shoulda made that ho bigger
Killing careers make these cupcakes remember
My objective is to serve your agenda
Biggie and Nas put they ass in a blender
Sprinkle some 50 and came out this nigga
Equipped with a gat and the dick in your mouth
Balls in my hands and your bitch in my house
Twisting up weed, I'm digging her out
Just filling her out
Do all that shit you be talking about
While you gone? Shit, Netflix on your couch
What this popcorn about?
Microwave oven while you out there cuffin'
You over there lovin'
That bitch be my stuffing, like...like we really be fucking

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Brand new clip, brand new nine
Brand new bitch, brand new ride
Brand new weed, brand new high
Brand new me, meet the brand new guys

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q & ASAP Rocky]
Brand new shirt to the brand new drawers
Brand new socks to the brand new Glock
This mothafucka hold 15, slap that ho in, tell the clip get lost
Bitch, I'm a boss, pulled up clean, don't you hear the exhaust
Got my tie on, gripping on my iron, who I'm 'bout to fire on?
Rap game fucked up, boy, fuck you think I rap for?
Crack game fucked up, boy, fuck you think I trap for?
Riding 'round with that mask on, like a Mac attack when that strap on
Like a Shaq attack on that backboard, clap on, clap off
Blue pit in my back yard Red nose my bad broad
Titan full of that hydro Pretty nigga, no catwalk
Big burner in your big mouth Pussy niggas suck lead off
I pull it up then skirt off, vodka shots, he Smirnoff
40 ounce of that Cristal, Rose, that Rick Ross
Got it jumping like Kriss Kross Mismatching, no jigsaw
No horseplay when we quick draw Pussy nigga get a tit job
Hands up, stick your mans up, your time's up, the new brand's up, Q!

[Intro]
I just, I just live
I live day by day, fighting demons

[Verse]
I smoked away my brain, I think I’m going dumb
Cocaine up on my gums, I think they’re going numb
I’m having stomach pains, now I’m throwing up
Cause I’m a microphone fiend, give me the bass
Give me the beat, and let me lean, tap the vein, let it stream
Feel the pain, young Martin Luther King, with a dream
That one day that my team, we can make it with this rapping
Now we swagging, making money in Manhattan, trick what’s happening
They try to intellect with indirection just to test you
A rebel until my death, it’s in my flesh, it’s in my vessels
Fuck the clique you with, I’m finna fuck the bitch you next to
Fuck a metrosexual, suck a dick, I’m disrespectful
You know the kid get it, get-get sick spit
Clip spit quick split shit hit kids women
Oh that’s your girl, huh? Well, I just hit it
It’s A$AP nigga, live with it, swag

[Hook]
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they starting to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they starting to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts

[Interlude]
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah, let the beat chill
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah, let the beat chill
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah, let the beat chill
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah
I'm a hipster by heart, but I can tell you how the streets feel

[Hook]
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they starting to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they starting to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's good
Oh shit
Mushrooms, LSD, marijuana
Light that shit
Oh shit

[Verse]
This is every heavy drug, that's known at every level
This assault with deadly metal bumpin' heavy metal
Do this for myself, of course my hood and every ghetto
Paper pushin', paper petal, cause I heavy petal
It's real nigga flowin' through my blood and every vessel
Time is money, so I saved the load on every bezel
I just had a dream, I dipped my watch canary yellow
I woke up and then I bought that bitch in every yellow
Let go back to business, my fizz product for my narrow
Cause life's a bitch with red lipstick and high stilettos
Flaco jumpin' fences from pigs, with 'em them biscuits
I hypnotized my six, but my .38 was kinda special
What a life this is, what a sight this is
Where the darks and the light skin kids
Get along with the white persons
All alike when the lights get dim
On a righteous pass, where you don't look back
Nigga spark your cig, niggas light your hash
Niggas light your spliff, where you puff, don't pass, just sit

[Outro]
I just had an epic dream like Dr. King
Police brutality was on my TV screen
Harmony, love, drugs and peace is all we need
Harmony, love, drugs and peace is all we need

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, this year we finna make a killin'
Now the money stack up to the ceilin'
All I know is payback, all I rep is A$AP
Now we finna go off in the buildin'
I could really give a fuck about your feelings
Used to be a schoolboy and a rude boy too
Not a jerk like the New Boyz, groovin' like Schoolboy Q, nigga
I done killed a few boys, nigga
Down a couple shots, turn it up another notch
Got a bitch that's in the spot and she faded
Yeah, corset top with the new ass shots
Couple Instagram likes, now she famous
Nose job, workin' on some payments
On a new car, now she finna trade it
Next time, you shouldn't've sucked a nigga dick for free
Man, I swear the smart girls are my favorite
(Oh, my God, your cable's turned off
You should've sucked the nigga's dick for free)
Brand new 'Rari, finna race it
I am not the nigga you should play with
This year, I turned it into the racist
All I wanna see is green faces
All I wanna count is green numbers
Man that shit is weird, lookin' like the Matrix
Gave 'em HiiiPower, Always Strive And Prosper
Only took a little bit of patience

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Shorty she like to pop ass high
Popped her way up to first class high
She clap-clap-clap-clap-clap, she drop it low
Then she clap-clap-clap-clap-clap, down to the floor
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Ever seen a crib like this?
Diamonds in my ear like wrists
Pull off at the light like, "Wuh", lookin' like a mil in that trunk
Two-seater got me lookin' all clumped, hit a nigga wig on sight
Serve a nigga mom off white, I'ma get her so high, I'm Christ
Nigga, ball so hard like Mike, I could whip that bitch like Ike
I can fuck your bitch off hype, pink ring, got bling all bright
How a hot nigga rock this ice? 14, almost got that strike
14, almost did that time, 14, had a 905
Clip small, but the shit shoot fine
Shoot a spine, make a nigga recline
Start sparkin', a nigga go blind
G Rides, hoppin out of Nissans
Do I got them hoes chirpin'? Yeah, uhh
Do I put the work in? Yeah
Do I got them hoes out workin'? Yeah
Do I make 'em put the work in the Birkin? Yeah

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Shorty she like to pop ass high
Popped her way up to first class high

Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet

Ohh, memories

[Chorus: Rod Stewart + Miguel]
Everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes I am
So everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go...

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Off again, there he go
To another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye
Prolly goin' ballistic, but listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws
They ain't never do drillin', true, you
Been sippin' away at the truth
A double shot of wisdom'll do, do, do
Rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses
To the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence
Go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (yeah) and he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, "Holla if ya need some dick"
The devotion is gettin' hopeless
But hold it, I'm gettin' close as my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts
A solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions
Adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

[Chorus: Rod Stewart + Miguel]
Everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes I am
So everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
"Hood dudes usually don't look like you"
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', "Pimp Squad, hold it down!"
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

[Bridge: Miguel]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

[Chorus: Miguel + Rod Stewart]
So everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes I am
Everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
Here I go, here I go, here I go!

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow



[Intro]
For all them hoes that was frontin' on niggas back in the days, man

You know what I'm saying?
Excuse me, fuck out my face
They say wealth is in the mind, not the pocket

Gotta pocket full of stones like Pimp say

[Verse 1]
Okay excuse me, Mr. Bill Collector, I got problems

Excuse me, I tell them they're excused

And uh, excuse me, may I be excused?

[Verse 2]
Tell me why these little niggas talking like they killas, bruh

Cup full of purple substance or something

[Hook]
Excuse me, I tell them they're excused
What's the word around town, tell me what's the latest news
And uh, who them niggas, I tell 'em we them dudes

Scoop back tees, breeze in the coupe
Smiling is your treasure, you're so well put together
Bags and links, jeans and shoes
Spikes and patent leathers, different fabrics mixed together
You and me, me and you
Go away together, we could get away forever
All emotions clashing, thrashing, someone turn the light out
I met my baby expressed my passion on my fashion night out

I think my cup is getting muddy, oh buddy
Is this that punch, drunk, and love it, no buggy?
Eyes bloody when we out in public
I'm hubby, she say she love me
Wasted money on syrup and honey, she think she Duffy
Then I became a druggy, enhanced my fame and money
And for your pain and suffering, my karma's waiting for me
Expecting payments from me
But she won't get a damn thing from me
She just might get a band aid from me
You swear the Benz and these bands ain't from me

[Pre-Hook: A$AP Rocky & (Joe Fox)]
I know I'm a scumbag and now your heart broke

Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick

[Verse 2: Future]
You the one that was putting up with me

I do this shit on the real, I like them drinks on the real
I fuck your bitch on the real
We do this shit on the real, keep it real on the real
I was just keeping it G, she don't spend money at first
Say you're in love with me, but I know it never gon' work

Eyes screwed up, I'm drinkin' syrup
I know that look that you givin' me
It's killing you softly mentally

Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on
Oh word? Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju… (Okay, I got it)
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin'; I'm beast

Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast

Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Hey lady, got something for you to buy now
Something cool, something new, something for you to try now
I know you feel alone, but I'm gon' get you high now
Now that you high, take your clothes off, and lie down

She say that my pipe is crack and you know I'm gon' get very ill
So I just penetrate and hit her with my needle

Get it how live it when you know you need the hook up
I can get it cook up, know I got you shook up, ooh

Put me in your nose, inhale my aroma
Shit so potent, shit stronger than ammonia
O.D. and fuck around and slip into a coma

[Hook]
We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, got her open, now she hoping
We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, I got her sipping, now she tripping



[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
I get so high, I touch the sky 'til I can't even function
I get so high, I fuck around and wanna leave the function
The only thing that's on my mind is I'm gon' leave with something
But it's nothing, and we roll one, with the 'tussin, and we gon' get

Get, get, get, get lit, lit, lit, lit
Get, get, get, get lit, lit, lit, lit
Get, get, get, get lit, lit, lit, lit

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
It's about to go down, drunker than a bitch
Afterparty with my niggas, slumber party with your bitch
Finna hit the lick, 10-56, takin' sips, let the syrup sit
Let it get the mix, everyday we gettin' gettin' lit
That Purrp purp and I get lit, 'methazine, tell 'em sip this
I'm on that Memphis, that 666, Trip Six shit, bitches
A 50 box of them Swishers, gold slabs on them 6's
In the back seat full of bitches, tryna hit licks, we gon' get lit

[Hook]
We about to get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
We about to get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit

[Interlude (over Hook): Fat Tony]

Young player out here in these streets mayne

We like "Fuck that, nigga, we out here, mayne"
Coming down, coming live

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Just light the candle on the nightstand, sitting by the lotion
I got her open, got her floating off this purple potion
Just take a hit, no time to quit because you gotta smoke this
I gotta focus when I pour it cause it's kinda potent
(She like them all gold slugs) No diamonds on it
I chunk the deuce, I'm coming down and I be riding spokes and

Now we gotta go get, get, now we gotta go get

[Hook]
We about to get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit

[Outro (over Hook): Fat Tony]
Young nigga from the southside of H-Town
Fat Tony up in this bitch, fuckin' with A$AP Rocky in this bitch
Out in NY, Harlem in this bitch
You know how young niggas connect from state to state
Feeling great, nigga, puttin' it in ya face, nigga
Out in the morning making this shit happen dawg
Young niggas ain't never understand
How we stay so throwed in this hoe, nigga
Niggas so throwed like we don’t know no better, nigga
We disobedient, nigga
Mama wanna grab the switch
We like "Fuck that, nigga, we out here, mayne"
Coming down, coming live



[Hook: Imogen Heap]
Do just what I tell you
Don't come in any closer
And no one will get hurt
‘Cause I don't know how long I can hold my heart in two

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A rebel I be one day, on that track with Gunplay
Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like André
Beef is on my entree, gin and juice, that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way
Pussy on a Sunday, business on a Monday
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway
Come be my fiancee, she fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge, just sit around and watch her sunbathe
Dinner date for one K, shopping date for two K
Bougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days
Finally got it today, swear to god my mood changed
Top off like toupees, drop off, touche
Yeah, my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy
And my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy
Bounce, boy, Flacko tell 'em holla at a nigga, G
Riding on my enemies, this my ghetto symphony

[Hook: Imogen Heap]
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Whipping Whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and locking up my swishas
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel
Before I get aggressive forget it, war ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
Till my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that
Black magic on the tires only I
Rolling down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still tourin'
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for
Pain, in its purest form
Don't complain I came to reign from here forward, still noid
So crib got clear doors
Burning planes in my Air Force and all I can see is clear ports

[Hook: Imogen Heap]
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer...

[Verse 3: ASAP Ferg]
Since Rocky spit like André, I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entrée, eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy
Mm, enjoy, when I get annoyed, know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid, body get found by a lil' fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenigga, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
That's for talking how fast you could grip a nine
Damn, look how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit the crime
These niggas got the sidewalk sipping wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times in your eyes has a nigga died? Never!
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, nigga



[Hook]
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 1]
Let's take it to the basis, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'mma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

[Hook]
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up some money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to complement the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, "Tell it to my face"
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

[Hook]
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off



[Intro]
808 Mafia
Cozy boys

[Hook: Waka Flocka + (A$AP Rocky)]
Car from overseas with four pipes
Met her in the club, I'ma fuck tonight
All my niggas felons, damn right
Nigga what the fuck you sellin'? That all white
(I can't forget that off swipe
Snow white in my frostbite
Whippin' and pitchin' that powder
Whippin' it harder, give it a short price)
She fuck with me then she alright
A$AP yellin' for life
(All my niggas rep Brick Squad
Fuck around and it's on sight)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm sellin' records while my dogs cookin'
I'm rockin' shows while you catch a plug
Fuck niggas, show 'em no love
And police, they can eat a slug
Cop killers give 'em hollow tips
Them bullets burn, I'm a rider bitch
Rental cars, hop out of it
RIP to the opposites

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
To the hatin' hoes, tell 'em ride a dick
White hoes love chocolate
Pretty Flacko and Flocka bitch
All eyes on me, 2Pacalypse
Might drive a Benz then cop a six
Drive a six then drop this shit
A year ago niggas was drinkin' Spades
Flacko home and he poppin' Cris
Nigga fuck cozy boys

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
I be fuckin' hoes hoes, breakin' backs
Pullin' hair, girl throw it back
Real nigga bust a bottle, throw a stack
Fuck a hater bitches like I'm Goldie Mack

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Watch these niggas gon' hate
And watch my niggas gon' spray
And watch these bitches gon' shake
If they watch these figures I make
I said, watch these niggas gon' hate
And watch my niggas gon' spray
And watch these bitches gon' shake
If they watch these figures I make



[Verse 1]
Bachelor with no tux, still got my shirt cuffed
Still got my sleeves rolled up and my shirt tucked
Grown up? Sure enough, sipping on that syrup
Purple Label shit, yeah, I wear what I sip
Scarface vision, see my visions on a blimp
And a quarter key will turn a G into a gent
All-purpose flow, we are the great
I'm so Kurtis Blow, and these are the breaks
My Christian Louboutins got nails, give me hammer toes
Niggas get shy when that camera rolls
Drop crotch pants will remind you of them Hammer clothes
All-yellow Phantom, I'm like Yeezy in that amber Rolls
"Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha," but who am I kidding?
No way I could afford it so for now I'm just pretending
How these gold diggers digging without a single pot to piss in?
Cause my pockets full of lint and my heart is full of vision, I'm grown

[Hook]
I don't do kid stuff much
Niggas say, "Now, nigga all grown up"
I don't hear y'all much
I'm all grown up, tough luck

[Verse 2: Seth Narley]
Curtains drawn and six dudes back
The chauffeur ride in the front as we speed to the dot
Deanna waits along with the classy mist
My waist my shoulder blades the type you can't resist
Picture this: being 21 with a gift
Bamas don't understand how I'm swift
Or I'm MJ-nice, like Jordan up on the mic
Amen for the new saviors of rap
My birth's 3/89 but I'm 30 up on the track
That's grown man, little homie, that's real rap
Y'all trying to switch up the style, I'm bringing Versace back
Giovanni, Medusa, and all black
Hot boy, I done ran through hell and walked back
Passport is stamped from sightseeing the map
And to think, I'm asleep but won't blink
I'm dreamin all this within, Young Leo, Inception
Come again? No offense
But fuck whoever said wearing slims was a trend
More like a lifestyle in the rawest form
All grown up, nothing like before

[Intro]
Ay, I have a message from the Most High that says:
"This negra kept his soul from the Devil"
It's true, I guess I mean, wait a minute now
Is your people really that God damn ign'ant? Really? Really?

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, "Quiet down"
Bow your head, the Most High's around cocktails
Guys and gals miss me, ties and gowns happen now
My entire sound is how you tryna sound? Stop it now
They ask me why I don't go to church no more
'Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub
And lies is the new drugs, my sister the next stripper
My brother the next victim, my usher the next tricker
Satan givin' out deals, finna own these rappers
The game is full of slaves and they mostly rappers
You sold your soul first, then your homies after
Let's show these stupid field niggas they could own they masters
Holy smokes, I think my pastor was the only folk
To own the Rollie, Ghost and Rolls Royces with no Holy Ghost
And get your shit prepared, face your fears, all you niggas scared
Say your prayers, pray you fit upstairs, it's our only hope
Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, "Quiet down"
Bow your head, the Most High's around, Lord
(These things are not right, these things is not right) Lord
(Hell, nobody's ever defined) Lord
The pastor had a thing for designer glasses
Yeah, I'm talkin' fancy plates and diamond glasses
The ushers keep skimmin' the collection baskets
And they tryna dine us with some damn wine and crackers
Who's more important than your Lord and Savior?
Won't let the pearly gates up in this
Probably due to all your poor behavior
My mental got a couple tips to save ya
Just be sure to count it as my only favor, thank me later
Uh, every night I stayed up sayin' prayer, made me greater, uh
Let's savior chasin' green for collard greens and baked potatoes
On the table, pray for cable, hit the label, now we major
Ha, I got my own relationship with God, Lord

[Hook: Joe Fox & A$AP Rocky]
Holy Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees
Holy Ghost, you're all I need, you're all I need
Holy Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees
Holy Ghost, you're all I need, you're all I need
Holy Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees



[Verse 1]
Smoking rolling reefer up, I adjust the tweakers up
Break it, break it down, break it down so I can beat it up
Where the welcome back? Where the welcome mat? My sneaker tough
This is for my old head go on turn your speakers up
Rocky, where you been? I been tryna make my ends meet
So I can cop that Bathing Ape or Jeremy Scott or 10 Deep
Bottles full of Rose, riding in the Benz jeep
Blowing money fast, now I'm finna think I'm Big Meech
I met with my old head we sat for a while
We rolled a couple swishers, we chat for a while
I said I'm just on my grind I come to Houston all the time
He said what's been goin' down in your New York state of mind
Fine, you ever got days you feel like giving up
Like how you gon' eat when this gig is up
When the chips is down and the jig is up
But I don't give a fuck, roll another swisher up
Cause I just came here down South so I could get these pounds out
And move my mother nice somewhere closer than a town house
And my beats banging, kicking harder than a roundhouse
I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out

[Hook]
Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, foes they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin' you'll be straight

[Verse 2]
Now my old head old age bald head rogaine
Code red codeine, nose red cocaine
Pimpin bitches since lemon chicken shrimp lo mein
Gold chains afros platforms soul train
And he told me 'bout that rapping trapping in the old days
When Pac hung with Suge before that rat tat tat tat nose rings
And I'm so high I could fuck around and grow wings
And we sipping on something purpler than Soul Plane
We sip slow, slow swing, tip foes and chrome wings
Told me I should head home and do my own thang
Then I heard my phone rang, hold up that's my old dame
Pick it up I hit you back, miss me and I miss you back
She said Harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back
You should come on home leave the drugs alone and stick to rap
Just don't come back flossin cause that type of shit'll get you clapped

[Hook]



[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I thought you said you’d never leave
I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you leave
Always come back ‘cause you wanna fuck
Always come back ‘cause you wanna fuss
Holdin’ back, ain’t no turnin’ back when you fall in love
Know what happens every time you speed
Always fall flat ‘cause you wanna rush
So we could take it slow
Separate the highs from the lows
Separate the evens from the odds
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart

[Hook: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I woke up today high
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I’m here to say I
Maybe even learned a lesson from you
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
If you fly away then rest assured

[Hook: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever

[Bridge: Florence Welch]
You’re the eye, but I’m tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I’m never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
You made a bet with me, now you’re in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It’s ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin’ ‘gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I’m in her heart on her left titty

[Hook: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever

[Intro]
- Yo, what's your name, young blood? What they call you?
- Well I got, I got, James, Jimmy or Byron Dean
- Yeah, I've been feeling that really JD swag lately

[Verse]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace
Uh, Schwarzenegger I, straight slaughter niggas
I'm offin' niggas, screaming off with niggas' heads
They all surrender, better call for niggas
Come at all you niggas heads, talk 'em off a ledge
I'm arguing with 'em, I'm done talking with 'em
I order coffins for 'em, call the coroner for 'em
Get a comforter for 'em, I did all you niggas' beds
I want all you niggas dead
You want oil nigga money, royalness and bread
Royalties instead of rollies for your boys, but loyalty is dead

[Bridge]
Now I'm only up again
Kick... kick a man while he's down
Looks dead; can’t be safe to say it
Everybody's getting punished
Looking down to sell with you, how have you been?
Probably an undercover, had them undercovers with you
People buying and selling for you
I'll only sell with you if you're blind to sell

[Outro]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace
Rep my block, quick to draw on all you niggas if there's beef
Blow your spot, better pray to Lord this shit don't hit the streets
Jimmy Dean



[Verse 1]
Bitch motherfuckers trying to fake it trill
Sneak diss you just to make a bill
Now the world won't take you serious
When I met you, you was painting nails
Leave a motherfucker layin' still
B-bang him with the stainless steel
Cause I'm making the order
Laugh at the altar, pullin' a Lord up
Don't get someone sawed up
Your brain in a sawdust, niggas is washed up
I bang out in Florida
Shoot in Miami, goons out in Georgia
Been to New Orleans
But still a New Yorker, nigga the talk of
Town, nigga we bossed up
Bounce, but when you talk to the Lord
Of course you're forced to
Bow down like a motherfuckin' peasant
Still that pretty motherfucker
And you know Harlem's what I'm reppin' nigga

[Hook]
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my niggas
I’ll die for my niggas, man, fuck them other niggas!

[Interlude]
Lord, please talk to me Lord
I am here for you Lord

[Verse 2]
Gettin' faded, hair gettin' braided, Sophie sniffed a line of ye
Playin' spades, bumpin' Jimi Hendrix "Purple Haze"
A 40 to the face, call my homies from around the way
Give me that pussy, I'll be on my way
But grab the jimmy so the bitch don't get no cash up out me
Pretty nigga, I'm a jiggy nigga, ask about me
Fuck niggas talkin' trash about me
But you know I toke a gauge, it can make any problem go away
Talkin' Jay, talkin' Ye, that mean you niggas talkin' cray
Razor blade across your face, I fix my face then walk away
I guess then there's nothin' more to say
Trill nigga to the death, whether Hell or the pearly gates
I think back to my early days
Whippin' and pinchin' that broad dough
It's a bit different now, switchin' and flippin' that raw flow
Substance get me higher, reefer and some fire
The devil is a liar, biased preachers shall retire
Jesus walked on water, I'm preachin' to the choir
Long live A$AP, now bow to your Messiah, bitch!

[Outro:]
Let the Lords toast with the Lords
Toast to the Lords
When come Gods, come Lords
Lords! Lords! Lords!
Oh Lord! Toast to the Lords!
As we live this day, please pray for us
When comes the saints, comes the evils, brings the Lords

[Hook: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
When I'm a man of my word, then I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing, left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like "Flacko where your ass been?
Heard you done with fashion, now yo ass is acting"
I'm tripping off the acid, now yo ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in vintage, Tommy and some mid Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture, changed hip-hop on ya
Smoking like a rasta was my pop's culture
I be damned if I die sober, I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya

[Hook: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
When I'm a man of my word, then I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
And shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight
Let em see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Beamers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
Cause I be playing with these womens like they sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, "I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden"
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music, I get you higher
Grab your lighter fluid, might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how we do it
Sit back and watch me do it

[Hook: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
When I'm a man of my word, then I got nothing at all

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Okay let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rapping bars it get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap I'm fashion forward, yeah I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?
Jiggling baby, nah, go ahead bitch
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familliar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ay just play it like I didn't tell ya
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away one day just like some love birds
Only one word I'm afraid of is the "love" word

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
More power to you, more power to you my lovely one
More power to you, more power to you my lonely one
More power to you, more power to you my lovely one
What's up bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who need friends
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Oh! Man, remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ay bitch you missed out, #fomo
I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
'Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male
Hallelujah



[Intro: Chace Infinite]
Fuck the bullshit, my nigga. Y'all niggas started this shit. A$AP started it, y'all finish it. Don't let these mothafuckin' devils come between y'all. They start tryna separate shit, make this shit they shit or something that it's not. Y'all niggas got the mothafuckin' plan. Build the mothafuckin' plan, keep the team straight and keep that shit G. Don't let these mothafuckas come in between y'all. Y'all got the power, keep the power in y'all mothafuckin' hands. Fuck these niggas man, go get it. Ya feel me? Keep it G

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
This is music for the villains, sophisticated children
A$AP in the house, now we're finna run the building
Working never chilling 'til I get a million
To the ceiling, now my niggas gunning for a billion
They ask me how I'm living, I say I'm gold grilling
Niggas acting different, mothafuck a friendship
These bitches is persistent, talking 'bout I'm distant
Lost my mind a long time ago to find it, need forensics
For instance, I get-get my dick licked
Red bone, complexion like a piglet, kiss-kiss
Fuck Ace, we sip Cris, a 40 cause I'm getting it
Drip-drip, the thought of it is ignorant, isn't it? (hahahah)
I'm ticklish, stunting is my business
Swagging on you hoes and I'm shitting on you niglets
So little homie, peep game
Cause these other rappers lame and don't care to do the same
Young blood

[Hook: SpaceGhostPurrp & (A$AP Rocky)]
(Hey, young blood) Stay true to the game
Fuck them lames, keep it mothafuckin' G
(Hey, young blood) Nigga I'mma tell you
Like a mothafuckin' G told me
(Hey, young blood) Stay true to yourself
Every day, low-mothafuckin'-key
(Hey, young blood) Cause at the end of the day
Fuck what you say, nigga I'mma keep it G
(Uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 2: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Well, let me tell you 'bout a nigga like me
I be smoking, choking, black locing with the OE
She wanna take a dick ride, we slide
Straight to the telly, shaking her jelly with my dick inside
Hit it in motion, in slow motion, hit it
Nigga, she's open, nigga I'm poking, split it
With it, get it right there in the bed
Open up your legs, let me beat that pussy red
Fuck what you said, I'mma still do me
Groupies, be sucking and fucking, porno movie
Do we have a problem in here
Look a nigga in the eye as I notice the fear
I am severe, my style is hella sharp, like a spear
All I do is sit back and think with a 40 beer
And you gotta feel the funk
While the bass plays loud booming all in your damn trunk

[Hook: SpaceGhostPurrp & (A$AP Rocky)]
(Hey, young blood) Stay true to the game
Fuck them lames, keep it mothafuckin' G
(Hey, young blood) Nigga I'mma tell you
Like a mothafuckin' G told me
(Hey, young blood) Stay true to yourself
Every day, low-mothafuckin'-key
(Hey, young blood) Cause at the end of the day
Fuck what you say, nigga I'mma keep it G
(Uh, uh, uh)

Faded, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
Gots to come faded drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
F-F-Faded, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and

Gots to come leaning, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
F-F-Faded

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
She's all that I need, I'm filling your cup up
With Sprite and codeine, she get me so high
But I'm down on my knees, was it your desire?
Your life or that lean? Wait a minute
Cause ain't shit changed, just a different day
This the kinda pain I just couldn't take away
Something like Wayne cause you couldn't feel your face
Is you in it for the feeling or the taste? Wait a minute
What's the mothafuckin' problem? Me and my niggas mob
Throwing up gang signs, fuck a goon and a goblin
Gold grill shining, don't ask me how I got 'em
Styrofoam cups with jolly ranchers at the bottom

[Hook]
Faded, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
Gots to come faded drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and

Ughm, wait a minute

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Hey and now I'm blowing hella smoke
Talking on my cellaphone and I got that purple on me
She sipping on my styrofoam cup
Telling me she wanna bone but I ain't got no condoms on me
She claiming I'm a Pimp C
Cause I'm sipping big mo when I'm on that screw juice
She sip it 'til it's empty
Purple on the mustache, now it's time to screw you
And I wanna chop and screw you, girl
Moving like it's turtle time feeling like the world is my mine
And I be on my Fergenstein
I stay on my money grind and I'm going outta my mind
Flying through the purple sky
And I'm in a different world and you kinda look like Jasmine Guy
And I'm kissing on that pink juice, sipping on that pimp juice

[Hook]
She's all that I want
Faded, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
Gots to come faded drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and

[Outro]
You can smoke that weed
You can sip that lean, get high

You can sip that lean, get high
She's all that I want
You can smoke that weed
You can sip that lean, get high
She's all that I want
Bitch



[Verse]
I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

[Bridge 1]
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

[Bridge 2]
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Duh, duh-duh
Dreamin' of sharin' love
Duh, duh-duh
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all

[Outro]
I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby I'm just rappin' to this LSD











[Verse 1]
I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen
Purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians, the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

[Hook]
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

[Verse 2]
Riding through your city like that motherfucka mine
Or choking on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind niggas talking down
Never talk to cops, make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom
Cause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines
Out committing crimes, wait for shit to simmer down
Corrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine
On the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya
Where they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?

[Hook]
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

[Bridge]
Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch, know we poppin' so she boppin' on this dick
Nigga, R.I.P. to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six

[Hook]
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE



[Verse 1]
Who the jiggy nigga with the gold links?
Got me reminiscin' 'bout my old day
Three 6, suck a nigga dick, no foreplay, all day
Boomin' out the trap through the hallway
Tell me what you niggas know about it
Auntie sayin' turn it down, or she finna call the cops
We be plottin' on the ops, she the one who got the drop
Just a free quick fix of the A, and it's okay
They gon' take me back to my old ways
I was tryna chill, poppin' seals ever since I got a deal
Kick it with my model chick, sip Cris, fuck niggas wanna diss
Now I gotta let 'em know who's really trill

[Hook]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been
You been crossin' our minds, niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave em style 9 times out of 10?
It was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye
Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye

[Verse 2]
I ain't never lookin' for no handouts
Broke ass niggas never helpin' but they hands out
Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand up guy, I'd rather stand out
Raf Simons, Stan Smith edition with my bands out
I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp, nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick, what? Pimps up, hoes down, whoa now
Slow down, see they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh
Trappin' through the speaker, peep the beeper ringer, uh
Turnin' off phones, just to reach 'em, gotta beep 'em
I'm a Lord motherfucker, better greet him if you see him

[Hook]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been
You been crossin' our minds, niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave em style 9 times out of 10?
It was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye
Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye

Mr. Pistol Popper, Flacko locked and loaded
Life's a bitch and she pussy pop, know why? Cause I got her open
That pussy soaking, fuck is you promoting?
Yeah, you claim you rage, you hating like you live in Oakland
All my rap town niggas with the roof back
Introduce you niggas to the new swag
Make you say a nigga blew up too fast
Fuck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new ass?
Fuck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new cash?
Thousand dollar drawers just to hold my balls
All I ever do is let my jewels sag
Pac gone, but the "Juice" back
Get your popcorn, juice, snacks
It's a movie nigga, with a new cast
Get the news flash, that the truth back
This is boom bap, mixed with new raps
Look at all the niggas that I blew past
Hood by Air, to the do-rag
Nigga make way for the new jacks

[Verse 2]
It's Mr. Pistol Popper screaming, "Fuck a copper"
I just bought a crispy choppa, finna fuck your block up, blocka!
Even cracked the pavement that's for niggas hating
I been impatiently waiting to show you niggas Satan
All this talk of Illuminati ain't got a clue about me
Bitch I'm Trillmaluminati and got my crew behind me
Shooters round me, keep them looters round me
Keep a tool around me, it'll keep you fools from round me
Couple of them dudes surround me
With a gat, with a strap in a backpack
When they cap cap, leave you flat, better back back
On a fast track, ratatat, nigga that's that
Nigga pass that, finna ash, where the hash at
Got a Kat Stacks with a ass, finna smash that
Make 'em catch that, A$AP, then I pass that
Off to my niggas then she ask, "Where the cash at?"
I see dead people, I need dead people
Lord Pretty Flacko, bitch, I behead people
Kneel and kiss the ring, all hail the King
Long Live A$AP put that on everything

Alright, mothafucka

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
P.O
One time for A$AP Yams
Let's go

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
What's this I see? Niggas tryna act like G's
Got A$AP, got Fergy with me
It's a new day, no Black Eyed Peas
That's that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, that's that shit
(You ain't got no Flacko in your Serato?)
Mothafucka better blast that shit
Niggas drink quarts of the Clicquot
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Flacko makes sales of the perico
She knows, went to ATL for my C-Note
'Member, I ain't ever have no home
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
Back when I was rockin' least (2 Chainz!!!)
I was trappin' off at least like three phones
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
I tell her, "throw on the dress with the pinstripes"
Know the one that fit the booty all skin tight, that's right
Yeah, you that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, move that shit
Frontin' like you did it for the fellas
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
But my neck is gold, the rest is froze
Sex and hoes, best of both, girls and girls, perpetual
Sippin' slow, Texas throwed, comma, I'm about decimals
Chill and get faded, I'm surprised that we made it
Young niggas know the sky's the limit
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Chill and get faded, shit, I'm surprised that we made it
Nowadays stress overrated
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded

[Pre-Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I wanna see you take it all off
And she just wanna make it harder
And we just end up takin' longer
Can't impress with them diamonds though, them diamonds

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Talkin' about M's
Talkin' bout M's, nigga, M's
Make 'em talk about, make 'em talk about M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Make 'em talk about, talkin' bout M's, nigga
Talkin' bout M's

[Interlude: A$AP Rocky]
It's like lately all I ever seem to think about is M's, nigga
Talkin' 'bout M's
See the same thing all up in my bank account
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's
And my YouTube account say the same amount
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Money talk and dogs bark
I got a pocket full of stones in my stonewashed
Lambo, brand new Lambo
With tiger stripes on it call that bitch a golf cart
I'm outchea, I'm so outchea, I swear niggas have no idea
I swear niggas better wear riot gear
Cause I appear and pow loud and clear give 'em diarrhea, oh
I re-up tonight, I'mma be up tonight, cookin' a key up tonight
Niggas de-up I slide to the right, throw a three up in time
Put a B up, let's fight, don't get beat up tonight
Feet up in my European, I ride with me heater inside
Kill you and your dog then go put on a shirt that say PETA for life
Like you sneeze you on tight, you got beef I got white
You got beef I got white, I got green, I got white
I got pink, I got pints, I got lean, I got ice
I got needles and pipes, I got clean, I got right
I got mean, I got nice, That's that Tina and Ike
I don't lean on her price, I don't cheat on her price
Try to cheat on the dice, you get beat on the spot
I get keys on the spot and I keep it on lock
And I keep it up safe, what you keep in your safe?
S'what I spent on my watch and I wave it like Ma$e
Bout to redo the face, get a see-through AK
I eat seafood and steak
But girl I'mma treat you like cake til I get a sweet tooth tooth ache
But wait let's talk about M's, not about them
I love my BM's, I love my YM ain't no more CM
Let's pluck out the stems, let's fuck like a nymph
She walk out, she limp, it's dark and we dim, yeah
We dem niggas, handcuffing him niggas back up and skim niggas
See that we strapped up we cap up your brim nigga
Fill my cup up to the rim nigga, Tunechi



[Produced by Hector Delgado & A$AP Rocky]

[Intro: Max B]
… Through the spot
Everyday was like a beef to me
Little nigga said he’d make it hot
You don’t wanna draw heat with me
I got niggas that’ll run up in your spot
Cooly nigga, you don’t really want beef
I’m Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
My bitch now tryna comfort me
And baby I wonder, baby I wonder

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Buccaneers of rugged gear, nigga fuck a fair
One, since year one, I've been thuggin' here, yeah, uh
Whole shit is ours, you in awe, please don't get involved
This is war, walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn
Behind prison walls, niggas lickin' balls, pause
Different cause, stricted laws
Damn if I don't break up in the mall, prison yard, prison guard
No principal, detention on your friends and all
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missing ma, hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit
Like the hard headed never listen, Lord
So tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to eat? (nigga)
If the richer's getting richer, the poor's growing weak (nigga)
My brother died up in the streets, may he rest in peace
Niggas got heat like Pusha T, get it cheap
Flacko how you been, where you at? I've been kickin' back
Relax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga neck
Hitta chit and chat, this and that, A$AP diplomats
I'm missing Max, wish that they could bring the nigga Bigga back

[Hook: Joe Fox]
And I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, motherfuck cops, what's up blood clots?
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause, buckshots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em twitch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip...

[Hook: Joe Fox]
And I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?

[Bridge: Max B]
I'm Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
Baby I wonder, baby I wonder

[Hook: Joe Fox]
And I wonder, as I'm laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?
And I wonder, as I'm laying down in bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?

[Outro: Joe Fox]
Sorry guys



[Intro]
This is my story, my struggle, uh
My bittersweet symphony, my pain, check it

[Verse 1]
Food getting lower, money coming slower
Damn land lord keep bitching cause you owe her
I'm too afraid to grow up, I pray to God I blow up
And roll up in something foreign where the front doors go up
I wonder if my peers could hear my prayers
The only nigga got me scared is the man upstairs
When my back against the wall, I'mma face my fears
I'll swallow my pride 'fore I swallow a tear
Cause I be going hard, Stevie on his job
I'm praying until something happen, I'm answering to God
These wolves got me scarred
I try so hard to survive, guess just to prosper gotta strive

[Verse 2]
Then I hit the stage, all gone and blazed
Everybody know my name and the song I sing
I rejoice my pain and they doing the same
And the haters gonna hate, I'm just doing my thing
Got my bad bitch with me she so dangy
Said she love ASAP cause we so tangy
Living life fast so I feel like kids
And I'm blowing up quick so I feel like B.I.G
With the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
Now we doing deals with the major businesses
Get a little change, niggas feel a little strange
Uh-oh truck flow, pull off in a range
Niggas say I changed but I'm living it up
Shit if money didn't change you, you ain't getting enough
Fuck coppin a car, I'm Tryna fly to the stars
Smooth on the moon and I be mobbing to mars
Niggas say I'm ill, y'all ain't telling me shit
Cuz the nights we was ill, y'all ain't help me with shit
Ooh now my money change drastic, The coupe do gymnastic
The doors lift up and the roof do a back flip
Zooming through traffic, probably with a bad bitch
Slash actress soon we on our way to Saks Fifth
Life was so tragic, all of that was past tense
Now I'm living lavish, this got to be magic

[Outro]
If I should die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord I rest in peace
If I die before I wake
Please rejoice this song I sing
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord I rest in peace



[Verse 1]
Get money addict, I'mma get "Money" tatted
Money in the attics, money in the stashes
Money in the cabinets, stuffed in the mattress
Safe full of guns, more money up in that shit
Taz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott Adidas
Maison Martin Margiella, three strap sneakers
Riding with a leacher, student and a teacher
It's money over bitches, no room for a skeezer
Thinking of a Lambo, Bathing Ape camo
Play with the money, turn Rocky into Rambo
Patience is a virtue, life is a handful
Friends, they'll hurt you, learned that from my grandfolks
Me under a lamp post while I got my hands closed
Haze to my brains like eggs, got it scrambled
Yeah I feel Rihanna and I understand Hov
What you think I rap for? To push a fucking Land Rove?
Now I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap
Some slept on me, other niggas took a nap
Now I'm in the basement, probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full but instead, you took a cap
They say Tyga and Diggy but Rocky been Jiggy
Curren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home
Can't really hate when they compare me to Drake
Could have been J. Cole if I met J-Hov

[Hook]
(Who dat? ASAP) But I'm fly like I never left
You's a lie, like fly without the letter F
If hip hop is dead, fuck it, let it rest
Reincarnated through me when she resurrect
Long hair, Blue jeans, live on U-Stream
High top boots like Pac in a Juice scene
No it ain't a movie, diamonds in by new gleam
Dead tone cause the redbones is my new thing

[Verse 2]
Nigga, I do things, let the coupe sing
Niggas say I'm insane, Saddam Hussein
Niggas still jokers, me, I'm on my Bruce Wayne
Fly kicks, my shit, yeah, I'm on that Liu Kang
I ain't bragging but I do this, my shoes is Bermudas
I'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest
And your foolishness and rumors, I give two shits
I only hear the money, save the bullshit for the Q-Tips
Swag is the coolest, my bitch is the rudest
My jeweler is Jewish and my wrist is the bluest
And I get it poppin on the block like Whoo Kid
ASAP standing on the block like the new kids



[Intro]
Uh, pain
Uh, pain
Uh, pain
Uh

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
So big you are, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who you call when no one else around

[Hook]
It was a lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
The future will be televised, haters getting genocide
23 and 43, I'm talking my Margiela size
My niggas is hella fly, you over accessorize
Dead alive, it’s in my repertoire, forever ever high
I never lie, never tell a lie, I would testify
Set aside dreams, I’m a king ask Coretta Scott
Cute faced, fat ass, and a nice set of thighs
Rihanna weave, I need a umbrella, ella, ella, ah

[Verse 2: Kent Jamz]
Everybody knows me, shit, still ain’t got no cash
Bitch, hit that flash quick, post my bad habits
Fuck you and your Instagram, match a gram, Mando
Royal blue foams, getting head in the red Lambo
Media take me out, TMZ all in the VIP
Bitch I’m hard and my loop concrete, too much Bossip if you ask me
Almost fucked fame, but she came with money
I got two bad bitches, haters wanna take em from me

[Hook]
It was a lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action

[Verse 3: Tube]
Tryin' to get on in this industry, acting like you're ruthy
Breaking down cocaine with the EBT, these male groupies doing it
However, whatever they seeing on the box
Everybody spit, everybody hot, everybody's an artist, everybody not
S-O L-O-S-T, niggas talking dollars getting change
In a minute I'mma lose my cool, Sprewell one year before '98
Like fuck coach, I’m cutthroat, so what goes
Do you head for the year they say might be the end?
Better look within

[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
Glitz and the glamors, we pose for the cameras
Ghetto niggas with me, they pose with the hammers
Ghetto girls with me, pink toes in the sandals
No dirty laundry, get your nose out my hamper
Clothes in my hamper, that bathing ape camouflage
Brands from Japan, you would think I was a samurai
Drop-crotch Jeremy Scott pants, bitch it’s Hammer Time
Getting dirty money but I keep my hand sanitized
Life is what you need, won't you take a Z, feel the breeze
Smoke the sour diese', hit that shit and please, act at ease
What you wanna be like the Black Eyed Peas, all these steezs
S-T-A-R-S, that’s Hollywood, won’t you rest in peace?

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
So big you are, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who you call when no one else around



[Hook]
Goddamn, how real is this?
I know them Harlem niggas gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga, but how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss
Goddamn, how real is this?
I know them Harlem niggas gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga, but how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss

[Verse]
Stone cold love, rose gold slugs
I could afford it, I imported stone cold drugs
Stone cold, rolling stone, I'm a stoned nigga
Write it on my tombstone, I was stoned nigga
Don't remember me as a wannabe New Orleans nigga
Slash lean sipping, Tennessee nigga, nah
Influenced by Houston, hear it in my music
A trill nigga to the truest, show you how to do this
My all gold grills give her cold chills
Said she's got a coke feel cause I'm so trill
Two dope boy scales, but I sold pills
No deal, put her on her feet, toe nails
Them vampires, them blood suckers, them thirsty killers
We 'bout it 'bout it, we rowdy rowdy, that Percy Miller
For really real, we chilly chill, don't sport Chinchilla
No bounty hunters, I'm bout to killa, I'm bout my skrilla
Give me the title, then give me the cash
Fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash, stealing my swag
Niggas is wickity wickity wack
Like Kriss Kross, her lip gloss
Slip-ons get slipped off
My bitch boss, Cristal
We smoking then thinking then burning that hash
Puff it and pass, making it last
Walk in my shoes and then cross in my path
Game was for grabs, making 'em crash
Took in a section ain't giving it back
Fuck the money, fuck the fame, this is real life
An insight to my trill life
Clams

[Hook 2]
Goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga, but how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss

[Verse 1]
I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell my niggas quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported, just important as your president
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my clique for nothing
Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing

[Hook]
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
Cause every day we on our pesos
(Gun cock, gun shot, gonna lick a boy)
Cause every day we on our pesos

[Verse 2]
Your bitch just said I'm hot, man I told her I agree
She gon' really think I'm hot, if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's
Popping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe
Inhale, exhale, cocaine, X pills
Import, export, Harlem catching rec still
So mami show me how that neck feel
Later show me how the rest feel, for now just chill

[Hook]
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
Cause every day we on our pesos
(Gun cock, gun shot, gonna lick a boy)
Cause every day we on our pesos



Marble floors, foreign whores, finna order more
Play that French Montana song, the one with Ross (Haaan!)
Ordered new Raf, it ain't from the store
Came with a piece, bangin' peace if it come to war
She takin' somethin' off, what you stuntin' for?
Fix your WonderBra, my style is rubbin' off
Swear that pussy Oasis if I'm in it raw
Out in London Town paintin' all the wonderwalls
Yeah I'm underdog, spring, summer, fall, winter
Niggas run to law, gun in drawers, gettin' bundles off
Takin' trips to Baltimore, with the raw, door to door
Fender boss, want the vintage Porsche with the oven doors
I just wanna have a little fun with y'all
But on the real, no, I kill folk
Growin' up I had a best friend who used to mail coke
Successful with the shit until the day they heard the seal broke
My other partner got a million dollars and he's still broke
My thot a primadonna and she whinin' cause her nail broke
Niggas comin' at me sideways like they heel broke
And I'm just glad I ain't ever gotta deal dope
Cause the vision was this tradition and pants
Whole squad in this bitch, all we missin' is Yams

Caught a wish and got bitches in France
Chain swing, see the king and they kissin' my hand

[Hook 1: Joe Fox]
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
So, so

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
My ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places
Like apartments, basements
Garbage vacant, lots, garages, spaces
Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceships
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Maison Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my iron lung 'til later die at 71, uhh

[Hook 2: Joe Fox & A$AP Rocky]
I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray to Lord my soul to keep

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days or razor blades with gangs
Who bang and never stood a chance
Some boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement, and my generation fucked, and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the higher me
Used to never give a damn, now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me
It's gotta be, awhole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living
That's how many fucks I'd give (fuck)

[Hook 1: Joe Fox]
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong

[Hook 2: Joe Fox & A$AP Rocky]
I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
So, so

[Hook 1: Joe Fox]
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong



[Verse 1]
Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck illuminati lies, say I'm lucified
Baptised in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks

[Verse 2]
Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like "Fuck them niggas!"
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm, take cover niggas

[Bridge]
If I shall ever fall, Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby, two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own, y'all, wish me luck

[Outro]
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan



[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
All I think about is life, nights, sipping on Sprite
Little codeine, nigga get throwed right
Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night
I just pray to God that the shit go right
Little argument, and their fists don't fight
Fuck a dog ho and the bitch gon' bite
A$AP nigga, sip Cris all night
So them R. Kelly hoes getting pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga get so nice?
Young nigga cold like he sitting on ice
Fuck broke, tryna be rich all life
I coulda been a criminal and just rolled dice
My nuts hanging, my top back
Hoes screaming that Pac back
Throwing Westside, bandana tied
A$AP life, got a Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all on my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
And my bitch white but my cock black
Purple drink? Got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk something
Bounce on me bitch, hurt something
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth something
So shorty, she a stunner and daddy, he a runner
Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shaking it fast and then making them stacks
And I'm taking it back and I'm taking her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kicking her out

[Bridge]
How 'bout me and you and you and I
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

[Hook]
So I say pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
That's all a nigga need

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
It's A$AP Q, where the bread at?
Fuck around and bring the hush puppies back
She fuck me and the homies, she was cool with that
The block hot so I'm shaded in my bucket hat
Pause a little bit, I gotta little advice
If you fucked her once, then you could fuck her twice
And don't get head from hoes with overbites
Just giving out game, nigga show your right
Born stunna nigga, turn night to bright
High as a kite in my Nike Flights
Made 30 Racks it was just a flight
Flew a bitch out too, it was just a night
Shorty got the booty make a nigga say, "Whoa"
Can I suck your titties, tryna see how far I can go
Try again and then again and she ain't telling me no
Sweetie tell me how you feeling, can I feel on you more?
She said, "I ain't fucking for free," but ain't shit I can't afford
Shit, I'll pay you for it, now bounce that ass on my bungie cord
Yeah, whoopsie daisy, put a good kid in your Section.80
Turn a baby into a lady, now here go the keys to my new Mercedes
Cause shawty she a stripper, all you got to do is tip her
She like ballers with some money screaming fuck them other niggas
Now do A through Z for a G, panties go down to her feet
Pussy get wetter for me, smackin' that ass to the beat, give her that Diggity-D

[Bridge] + [Hook]

Sixteen gold teeth and four gold slabs

Givenchy tee and extraordinary... (swag)
My wrist said I'm rich, my whips say I made it

Hit a lot of licks, sold a lot of bricks
Served a lot of pounds, and I will never quit
Gucci going loco, had that cocoa loco
Shorty say I fucked her, I don't really know, though
These ladies want a hug, baby want a photo
Blue and white diamonds bitch, I'm so Tony Romo
Thirty-four bricks, I crammed 'em in the van
Stack a lot of bands and I serve a lot of grams
Thirty-six O's, stamped with the dragon

[Verse 4: Pharrell Williams]
Your girl hold my dick like a Wii controller
Where's your bitch, nigga? We control her
The weed she holding while she be over
And when she saw my mothafuckin' keys, it's over
And when I start it up, she like, "Lean me over"
Cold heart, warm dick, momma we be polar
I wore Louboutins before they knew what they was
They like, "Louis Vuitton? Naw, uh-uh, cuz"
That's when I realized they didn't know what they was
Them niggas actin' like I fuckin' stepped in blood
O-7 2-11, man, I put out duds
And ate space cakes that was filled with bud
And now 2012 nigga, look at these scuds
Green hair, money on my mind, hip hop grunge
You wear a cross, I wear a Cartier nail
You niggas ain't fuckin' with Pharrell
My wrist sizzle hot like it's stuck in the chair
My jewelry's so loud, it's got something to share
Like a conspiracy, like it's ACHAP
Everybody on my dick like Ahab
Wait, did I say that? First pause, then play back
Recognize nigga, ASAP

[Hook]
If you a trill nigga, get your mothafuckin' hands up

Big chain on me like Treach from Naughty by Nature
Fuck what you saying, no way, a hater don't faze a gangster
Brought up in danger, all about paper, smoking on purple
Bitch, I'm Dangerous Nasty Crazy 90's Baby, momma I made it
Up to the sky, goodbye to the pavement, hoes get caught in amazement

Purple pint, that's Gucci rap
Driving slow, black on black
Backwood lit, windows cracked
Dime in my lap with her hair pulled back
And a hand full of diamonds all on my wrist
Mouth full of ice, pardon my lisp
World full of hate is fear a few rips
So I open my mind and stack up my chips
Lollipop grind, whole lotta licks
From paper planes to a house made of bricks
Big ol' cold cup with codeine mix
So I'm so throwed and I'm still gettin' lit
And everything is purple, baby

Nigga, I rep the streets and I rep the hood
And I'm grippin' grain, grippin' stains
And I'm flippin' mane and it's kinda good
I'm holdin' wood with diamonds on it
Hittin' the block and I'm grindin' on it
With a big ol' chain and a big ol' piece
‘Cause when I'm in these streets I be shinin', homie
Haters better get they ass behind me, homie
‘Cause I'm in the front and I'm takin' charge
And when I'm done, I'mma have a homie run
And they be hard to find like they's El Debarge
And my swag is large, extra large
I can barely fit it up in this room
But don't sweat the size and don't be surprised
When your bitch reminds that I'm the shit to swoon
I lick the blunt and I pass the 'dro
Spit my game and I smash your ho
But no, I ain't trick, it's no passin' dough
Then I hop up in this slab and I mash it, bro
I got a passion for this Southern flow
This that purple life and we thuggin', bro
These haters might not really understand it
But that's all good ‘cause we love it though
This PAT, that's where I'm from
That's what I rep and that's how it go
I roll with rocks so get up off the jock

[Verse 2]
Rotation is like basketball blunts is going back and forth
Niggas mixing hash and dro with cinnamon that's applesauce
Show this what you asking for liqour is my last resort
Steaming niggas grab the torch then puff puff pass it off
Uh, and tell me what you think about it
I been getting high, I'm tryna get a drink around it
Now my high is higher than it's ever been
I'm so mothafuckin' high, I think I might never land
They be talking crazy but I been rolling hazies up
I been having like a 20, 40 then that 80 bucks
Man I come through get that Mercedes truck and then them ladies fuck
They already know we got them blunts and we blazing up

[Hook]
Let me know, know what's up
Before I roll, roll one up



[Verse 1]
I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles and overbites
But I'm pimping, nigga: Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it

[Bridge]
I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

[Verse 2]
Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly

[Outro]
It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise
A$AP



[Sample]
One, two, umm
Buckle my, umm

[Verse 1: Rocky]
Pass the mothafuckin' Swisher, pour some mothafuckin' liquor
For my mothafuckin' niggas who ain't wit us, keep it trilla
My gold teeth, my french braids, getting throwed since 10th grade
Wealth is in the mind, not the pocket, if that's the case, then I been paid
Herringbone chain, my gold frames, my Cartiers, you small change
You bitch made, I'm old school like gemstars and switchblades
I spit game, I get paid, a pimp game
I be, I be that pretty muthafucka, A$AP is just my nickname
(I'm comin' down when I'm tippin' on them 4's
Cause we shittin' on these, shittin' on these niggas and these hoes)
Cause that purp shit I sip up, your bitch chose, you slipped up
I get-get my dick licked, I'm draped out, drip-dripped up
Top of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin' my mind
We runnin', we runnin', we gunnin', we gunnin', we're gonna hit one at a time, time
Them bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe, a weirdo but I'm real though

[Verse 2: Twelvyy]
All these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggas wanna jock 'em
Not a red light or a city cop that can stop 'em
Going broke is not an option, always on that cash flow
She used to call me asshole, now she drop that ass low
Fuck it man I'm past dope, sour diesel slash coke
A$AP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow
I slow it down I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up
That's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch
I'm headed to the future, Twelvyy ain't no loser
Mixing up that syrup, call it Punky Brewster
I'm slurring wussup, don't tell me to shut up
I ain't tryna start shit, but man I'm really fucked up
I lucked up, I see it as a come up
I'm on my job man, I see you when the sun's up
Huh, young niggas run everything
A$AP to the top and these bitches love everything

[Verse 3: Nast]
God bless America, my flow is scarier
Style wild like my nigga Common after Erykah
Your bitch, I'm in bed with her, head so good
Make a nigga feel good to the point I wanna marry her
But I be on my pimping shit, check out my limp and shit
I be getting money, getting money, can you dig it, bitch?
Hoes get on my pimping ship all aboard, all aboard
East coast mothafuckas making all the noise, all the noise
I know you niggas heard of us, Raf Simon murderers
Fashion killa word to Bigga Bars, I never heard of ya
Still sipping candy painted whips is what I'm sitting in
Kitchen chemist whipping up that shit that get these bitches in
New York Nasty flow, that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of Hen
Business man, middle finger to your fucking business, man
Great adventure shit, rollercoasting take a flick of this
Motion picture shit, bitch I grind like a skater do
Always $trive and Prosper rock what level we gon' take it to?

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A$AP, where my crew at
Swag so sick where the birds caught the flu at
All the hoes know me, don't need to ask, "Who that?"
Or where the heat at, my nigga, cause we do that
And pistol popping get it popping, niggas better move that
Cause we get a Glock and with the stock and he ain't scared to shoot it like
4 G's: blew that, G4: flew that
I'm the shit, you must admit, true that
I'm so uptown
Niggas know we get it for the low uptown
Gold, got 'dro, got snow uptown
Bitch-shit niggas scared to go uptown
Money making Manhattan, whip game proper
Them might be the product of the locker
A$AP, know I'm gonna prosper
Don’t care, cause I'm only straight as my posture

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Nast]
Boom, nigga, Nast in the house
Flow like a drug, pass it around
Fag, you're in doubt, what you rapping about?
A$AP nigga, trash on the couch
Glass to the mouth, Patrón in the system
Tool on the waist just in case I gotta fix 'em
Bullets like fiends just dying to hit them
Nigga did I mention, swag house nigga
Get slapped in your shit if you badmouth nigga
Left the Range in the garage and brought the Jag out, nigga
Nast be the shit that you brag about, nigga
I ain't even tryna hear about your hereabouts, nigga
Weird-ass nigga, scared-ass nigga
I'm done with this track, did you hear that, nigga?
(?) and I did wrap niggas
Try to step on my throne? Bitch, this is my home

[Hook]

[Verse 3: A$AP Twelvyy]
I'm a uptown blood slime, balling's in my blood line
Pants sagging real low, I'm running from the one time
Free Church boy, yeah, my nigga caught a gun crime
Mobbing on Lenox and I'm grinding 'til the sunrise
I'm really getting dope, boy, free my nigga Dough boy
Catch me on Broadway, we got it for the low, boy
And I got flow, boy, in other words, hoes, boy
Body after body, yeah, you already know boy
I'm bumping "Oh Boy", classic Harlem shit
True Religion, who you kidding? Nigga started this
Young Twelv' get it gang, got the hardest shit
Polo down to the socks, looking marvelous
I'm from the home of the free S
I'm Grade on the West like I'm Gucci on the ES
Aura like GS, stepping out the GX
A$AP up, y'all niggas kill me with the BS... P.S.:

[Hook]



[Intro]
Clams Casino, ASAP (Wassup)
See me in the hood the gangstas saying wassup (Wassup)

[Verse 1]
Back once again, sipping Henn, mixed with juice and gin
Bitches in, couple lady friends countin Benjamins
Spinners spin, on the 20-twins that Mercedes-Benz
Dividends made a change of plans well that all depends
Shout-out my parolees and I smoke that OG
Kush mothafuck the police, all my niggas rock gold teeth
So hood and we so street, sipping on that codeine
We hustle hard no sleep, your bitch loose that's no leash
I ain't talking 'bout no money, I ain't talking 'bout no cars
Talking 'bout no diamonds cause that shit is a façade
Times is really hard, I fucked a couple broads
Smoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are

[Hook]
I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching, we gon' make it in a second
Pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching we gon' make it in a second
See me in the hood the gangstas saying wassup (Wassup)

[Verse 2]
Pretty nigga in some shit you never hear of
Only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror
Yeah, clothes getting weirder
Money get longer, pretty nigga pin your hair up
The nerve of this dude
But I'm cool as a fan, 40 ounce full of brew

[Hook]

[Intro: Juicy J]
The hustle continues
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is
Put your mind to, something you want
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is
It come true

[Hook: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you baby)
It's what I do
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I remember all the nights
On different corners spittin', pitchin' water
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sister's daughter
Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Poor without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines 'bout the section lines
I sit you kids who listen for us
I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact
Get money, yeah I do that, thought you knew that

[Hook: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you baby)
It's what I do
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
Candy low slider, I'm a soul survivor
Keep a Sweet in my visor, bitch I'm keepin' it liver
Than the average Joe, I think fast, talk slow
He think he want a war but he don't really wanna go
Need to get me some head from Sheryl Crow
A helluva blow, from a millionaire snow
You can waste your time, with the goody goody two shoes
Now I'm puttin' em on the spot, I give a ho the blues
I'm touchin' on her cot, I put her on the block
You think I'm startin' over, bitch I ain't never stop
Poppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills
Don't give a fuck bout where you're from
Don't give a fuck bout how you feel

[Hook: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you baby)
It's what I do
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I'm the best still in this game, I'm rich bitch like Rick James
Got a group of hoes in MIA, get a condo in Biscayne
The Louis store, I drop bands, the Gucci store, I drop bands
Prada store, I went HAM, my left wrist, it cost a lamb
Your girlfriend a groupie, like Trident, she wanna chew me
Hell naw I ain't cuffin' 'em, I'm a dog just like Snoopy
And when I leave the mall, it's sold out, erryday shoppin'
Taylor Gang, blowin' money, $50,000 on wrist watches
$100,000 in a plastic bag, we takin' off, bitch pack your bags
Bitch I came from having nothin', damn right I have to brag
Try me and I'll pop your ass, stupid nigga, get a body bag
All I talk is money ho, rich niggas don't lollygag

[Hook: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you baby)
It's what I do
Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you)

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Get money is the main reason most people wake up
The root of why most relationships is startin' break ups
While niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player, amen, inshallah
Been like that, ain't a damn thing change
Money on mind, the red of my brain
Candy paint is gonna drip that stain
Lean on left, the grip of my grain
See ain't a damn thing change but the weather
So If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together

[Outro: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (what I, do)



[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
These days of preference has no complexion
You could be light, dark, mixed or fair skin
Just light the candle
Cold sweats down the handle, life's a gamble
And she know
Love with me is like a casino, outside of Reno
A couple white lines
A cup of white wine of Pinot, Italian Grigio
House keys to P.O
Ride from overseas but that's basic
Wasted, high on the West Side Highway
Drunk enough to fuck with, face it

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
Hangovers, leftovers in the Range Rover
Shame on her, make up or get a makeover
Think over, Glenfiddich start to takeover
When I brainstorm, all the hoes ain't got a thing on her
Audemars, season order like summer fall
I throw the Audemars, then I throw out all the ball
New Dior from the boutique store
Only thing in common that we got is that we want it all
Little cutie pie, saw her looking super fly
More Justin Timberlake on my suit and tie
Try to scrutinize, cause I keep two inside
Suicides? No sir, hoes get the Uber ride
Or we can kiss 'til the sun come up
Or, sit on my lap 'til somethin' come up
She ain't really wanna club, I don't really wanna judge
Girl just wanna have fun 'til the fun run up

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
On the highway to my place
It's higher than you ever been
By to my way, be all day
Me, you and all your friends
In love, fuckin'
In love, just too much, ohh

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]

[Verse 1]
Wake up feeling blessed up, pistol on that dresser
Ain't afraid to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testa...rossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup 'til I'm messed up like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimping hoes, you could tell by my paystubs
My niggas gettin' right, smokin' weed with dirty Sprite
Going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

[Verse 2]
Finna wild out for the weekend, me, myself, and I – my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy
You don't really wanna feel them shots boy
You a b-boy, I'm a block boy, I'm a D boy, I'm a hot boy
Six shots got me feelin' like Pac, boy, party all night, shit don't stop, boy
Drunk as fuck and I'm ready to fight
Wilding for the night, fuck being polite, boy

[Hook]
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going

[Verse 3]
It's the weekend and I'm creeping with my niggas
Drunk and disrespectful, callin' women bitches
I don't mean no harm but won't you and your friends
Meet us in the cut and we can do the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And your girl just said they with us
So we rolling in them Benzes
Won't you pour it up and stop the babysitting
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids

[Verse 4]
Back to the Mac, tats on her back
Ass so fat, hit that from the back
When it clap from the back, she clappin' it back
She flat on her back and it's back to the trap
Fuck your pack, A$AP where it's at
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck your dreams, leave a punk nigga dreamin'
Then you sleep, and you won't come back from the nap
Benjamin Three-Stack, it’s a fact, she lives in my lap
On my Outkast, daddy fat, bitches on my sack
And you know them smokin' bitches rolling reefer got me open
Wildin' to the morning with my homies, tell 'em where we going

[Hook]
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going

[Verse 1: Ab-Liva]
Two-door, four-door, sedan, roadster
Cabriolet convertible, careening in the coaster
Christian Louboutin, straps is like a holster
We balling -- ESPN highlights, posters
Tangerine Lambos, Mimosa, raise a toast
We at the Grammys, then Miami playing Boca like it's poker
Had a room at the La Quinta, full of soldiers, full of coca
Feel a ulcer, hundred grand up in the sofa, reupholstered
I am twisted, I am Heath Ledger, Joker to you jokers
If you Tony, I hang up, send a hit, I am Sosa
I am cultured, I am legend, I am Liva, I am closer
To the best writer alive, other two, I'm the closest
No holsters, no chauffeurs, no mask, no witness
No corpus, no guts, no glory, no joking
All-Star we play -- C-I-two A
And 2 Chainz, with my bad bitch -- it's my b-day
This life that we live is for the connoisseurs
Carnival, Gansevoort everyday poolside cabana floss
Mami in Manolo's, I'm in that Gucci polo
With the multi-color collar moving dolo on my solo
My niggas that's in prison, I'm they eyes I'm they ears
Every champagne night for every laugh there's a tear
There's a picture being shown in every jail, every tier
Representin' so my niggas know I'm here
Polaroids being shown in every jail, every tier
Representin' all my niggas know I shared from the heart



[Verse 1: Ryan Bradley]
I pull up slow 'cause you got somebody
No knock, no stone, just a text
And the next thing you know, you're here
Fuck the heartstring shit, let's explore your body
No hearts, no likes, just a night
In the white of the moon so clear
Playing with fire, we can't stop
It's getting hard to breath
Walking the wire, we're bound to drop
Baby, it's plain to see

[Hook: Ryan Bradley]
We're dangerous
Both of us
We break up and move on
Then we're back on the phone to making love
We're dangerous
The way we touch
We break up and move on
Then you're back in my arms to making love
Dangerous
Dangerous

[Verse 2: Ryan Bradley]
Skin tight, I fight, but there's no use lying
Adrenaline from the sin that we're in
Lay on back, I'll control your fears
Playing with fire, we can't stop
It's getting hard to breath
Walking the wire, we're bound to drop
Baby, it's plain to see

[Hook: Ryan Bradley]
We're dangerous
Both of us
We break up and move on
Then we're back on the phone to making love
We're dangerous
The way we touch
We break up and move on
Then you're back in my arms to making love
Dangerous
Dangerous

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Didn't matter who you was dating
I snatched you with no patience
Made you dash to this location
Then I, had to hit no waiting
But I didn't know it was gonna be like that
Love came and hit me like splat
So I had to go tell every chick that was hanging on close to me like scat
And they ain't like it
So much negativity came to us from both sides
Yeah those exes tried to really detangle us, but those died
And we became enough
For each one of us, we aim to bust
At any motherfucker try'na stop us 'cause we dangerous

[Hook: Ryan Bradley]
We're dangerous
Both of us
We break up and move on
Then we're back on the phone to making love
We're dangerous
The way we touch
We break up and move on
Then you're back in my arms to making love

I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know, girl

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Money in the air as mo' fell, grab you by your coat tail
Take you to the motel, ho sale, don't tell, won't tell
Baby said I don't talk, Dogg, but she told on me, oh well
Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do?
Baby, stick to me, and I'mma stick on you
If you pick me then I'mma pick on you
D-O-double G and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Rip ridinin' them poles and them doors is tight
And I'mma get me a shot for the end of the night
‘Cause pussy is pussy and, baby, you're pussy for life

[Hook: Akon]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole

I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know, girl

[Verse 2: Akon]
Shorty, I can see, you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
So you lookin' at me now, what its gonna be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Trying to get you up out this club
If it means spending a couple dubs
Throwing bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that ‘cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move 'phetamines
Girl I spend money like it don't mean nothin'
And besides, I got a thing for you

[Hook: Akon]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know, girl

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Mobbin' through the club in low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoking section (Just smoking)
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby, I see you)
It's cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', ya humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin' (Yeah)
You smilin' and grinin' and lookin' at me

[Verse 4: Akon]
Girl, and while your looking at me
I'm ready to hit the Caddy right up on the patio
Move the patty to the Caddy
Baby, you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything
And that's kind of scary
‘Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncing, got me tipping my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

[Hook: Akon (x2)]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know, girl



Oh my God
Oh my God, why?
Oh my God, why?
Why?

[Verse 1: Alt-j]
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I'm gonna bed into you like a cat beds into a bean bag
Turn you inside out to lick you like a crisp packet

Ooooh, devour me
Ooooh, Lou Lou, let the cover girls sing

[Bridge: Alt-j]
I want every other freckle...

Ooooh, Lou Lou, let the cover girls sing

And all mouths that surround you
Yes, I'm gonna roll around you
Like a cat rolls around the chrysanthemums
I'm gonna kiss you like the sun grounds you
(I'm gonna kiss you like the sun grounds you)

[Bridge: Alt-j]
I want every other freckle...

[Hook: Alt-j]
Devour me
Let the cover girls sing!

Hoes don’t love ‘em, don’t treat ‘em
I just teach ‘em to stroke ‘em
Pass that over to LODEF
He gon’ pass it to Jose
He gon’ lend it Mikos
Okay bases are loaded
Then she make it to Parker
She MVP with the trophy
Like Eric Wright with the shotty
Curtis May with the fender
Flava Flav wit the clock
I had no time to play pitcher
You niggas acting like goalies
Yous a hatin’ defender
I stay on Ps and Qs
Since the top of my sentence

[Hook]
And I’m ready
If I don’t go
Don’t go
Don’t go

Don’t go
Don’t go

[Verse 2]
They oughta know

How you feeling, Uhhh! That's that Master P! (It's that Master P)
Did you roll or make it mine (Make your mind up)
We stay whole and you can wind (You can wind up)
Pick on the floorda, they gonna pop that cola
Bitch niggas wanna roll up, bitch nigga here get rolled up
Slow motion watch me bend that corner (Bend that corner)
Slow motion let she give me more, muh

[Verse 3]
I can’t stand what you got
Girl your ass is Movado

Collard greens in my pot
All these clouds I think I finally see the top

[Hook]
And motherfucker I’m ready

If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up



[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Why lie?
Why lie? Yeah

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I'm only comin' out to play
Nothin' more that I hate in this life
The wrong impression, I only have one to make
You can open your palm, waiting to catch a break
The cards will fall where they may
And what about me?
I believe in fate, huh
They wanna know where I'll be in five, huh
What about today? What about tonight?

[Hook 1: Anderson .Paak]
Only one at a time
So precious, is yours, is mine
Only one at a time
My life, my life, yeah

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Am I wrong to assume
If she can't dance, then she can't ooh?
Am I wrong to say
If she can't dance, then she can't ooh?

[Hook 2: Anderson .Paak]
Hey, I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, is yours, is mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, is yours, is mine

[Hook 1: Anderson .Paak]
Only one at a time
So precious, is yours, is mine
Only one at a time
My life, my life, yeah

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Smiles around the clock
Dance around the globe to Disco 54
I stare at you in the eyes and spin you on your toes
Music ain't music without soul
Feelin' the top row
Shut the blindfolds, pass the nitro
Rock the love boat, get high or get low
Chill the Merlot, steady your fast pour
You pick up, we go low
Make love once or more, we rest then encore
Do-do that-that-that, hey
Break you off in your Kit-Kat-Kat, hey
Never seen a one this gorgeous
Pay your whole damn mortgage
Will you look at the time, hey?
Still you the one on the mind, hey
Still you the top of the rhyme, hey, thank God that it's Friday
Tonight let's be the life of the party
It's nothing to me
Get up and move your feet, ah!

[Hook 2: Anderson .Paak]
I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, is yours, is mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, is yours, is mine

[Hook 2: Anderson .Paak]
I never wanna waste your time, my life
So precious, is yours, is mine
And look at the time, my God
So precious, is yours, is mine



[Verse 1]
Time never cares, if you're there or not there
All you ever needed was a simple plan
But you're doing well, I mean you're not dead
So let's celebrate while we still can

[Verse 2]
I know what they say, I could give or care
They talk so much on me, I must be doing something right
I saw my son today, in the likeness of a full grown man
So I'll celebrate while I still can

[Chorus]
Oh on a clear day you can see West LA, even downtown
I remember where I couldn't even see the point
Of stepping out the mother fucking house
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I came to fixing up the tree that farms move
I've came too far

[Verse 3]
How many others have walked the same ground you have
You will be wise to pay attention to your old head
I spent the whole day throwing records in the deep end
So lets celebrate while we still can

[Verse 4]
Captivated, the fruits of my family tree
Where would I be without you
What would you do without me
It would be a bad look talkin' bout what could've been
So lets celebrate while we still can

[Chorus]
On a clear day you can see West LA, even downtown
I remember where I couldn't see the point
But now I'm at the point where I got it figured out
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I came to fixin' up the tree that farms move
I've came too far

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 5]
Do not be concerned about the money in your brother's hand
What's mine is yours
I thought you knew me better than that
I was under the impression that we all want the best of life
So let's celebrate while we still can

[Skit]
The partnership of the, of the board and the body of the fellow that is doing the maneuvers
In the fluent directions with the, with this wave is what interests me
Now chaotic surfing, nervous surfing, and uh, surfing power has its, has its merits
And I, uh, I can—it fascinates me. That's just not my direction
I, I can only speak for myself

Y'all niggas got me hot

[Chorus]
Hey, now you, drank up all my liquor, come on

Let me get down
You might not never come down
Now let me come down
You might not never come down
Let me get down!

You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Verse 2]
C'mon, uh
Can't beat it, can't beat it, can't beat it
Can't beat it with a big bat though
Can't see her with this pitch black Gucci frames on
Let me take these bitches off
Let me get the full scope, hold up
Huh, full screen, HD, let me take another picture
Let me pull it to the pre-show
Whoa, cool beans, cool beans
That's a whole lot of reefer
Let me help you with the pre-roll

[Chorus]
You, drank up all my liquor, come on

Uh, what’s the topic of discussion?
I be flyin' to the nookie in my hoodie, hit the pussy (icky, icky, icky)
Seven figures like your digits, we can travel off your pivot

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Okay now take that, baby, where the Wraith at?
The Bentley truck if you can pay that
A small village, you could say that
But you'd rather take your bankroll to Rodeo, let her raid that
No, tell 'em "hell no"
Middle finger, duck, roll and tell pros
Stick it to the rear like it's velcro
What other country can you sell blow?
And for less than a kilo, girl, you get an elbow
I'm gettin' high, never come down
Round up your rile and we'll run it down
Soon as it dries I'ma run the town
I fantasize shooting Trump down
A shot for every black man who got gunned down
By the police with no convictions so they run 'round
When we protest they tell us pipe down, for Trayvon and Mike Brown
CNN wanna make it black/white
Cause we hit the action with a blacklight
Make them suckers act right

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You, drank up all my liquor, come on

And you talking all that shit, now come on

Dogtown is what the kids call their hometown Venice, Venice California
It's one of the showplaces in good ol' American self-expression
Here you do your thing and the world watches



[Hook: Anderson Paak]
Baby, your drifter is all I can be
But you don't stop me from floating up stream

[Verse 1: Anderson Paak]
Into the town about half past three
Taking a addy and try to bag a couple bitches
Fresh out the addies but I got a half a bleeze
A full tank of gas I just need a pot to piss in
Bottled water, Trident, cashews, and Swishers
Flirting with the workers
Bitch you could get it
Thumbing through my browsers
Power moves and pivots
Swimming in the fountain
Diving off the deep end

[Hook: Anderson Paak]
Baby, your drifter is all I can be
But you don't stop me from floating up stream

[Verse 2: Anderson Paak]
Momma you didn't say much but that was key
Real niggas do real things
Let your actions speak like [?Sireaz]
Unless they want action, in that case you swing
Young but I'll listen
Always made the best of life through life's givings
Always packed an extra pair of clean britches
Everyone's a star, gold is in the diggings
So with the bitch you bought I don't ball on extensions
Everyday a hustle dollar day
Thug holiday on my daddy grave
In the Grinch Who Stole Christmas

[Hook: Anderson Paak]
Baby, your drifter is all I can be
But you don't stop me from floating up stream

[Outro: Anderson Paak]
Floating up stream
Baby, your drifter is all I can be
But you don't stop me from floating up stream
But you don't stop me from floating up stream
That's all I can be
If I sink I sink



[Hook]
She don’t give a fuck
She don’t ever stress me
We don’t even talk
All we do is sex and leave
No there’s no love
She don’t even like me
But if we have drugs
She can be my wifey
When we have drugs
When we have drugs
When we have drugs
When we have drugs

[Verse 1]
I got lost up in it, got lost up in it, got high for a minute
Said my lust for life and these lights are bright and I love these women
Said we bopping slow and we do the dance like we more than winning
Said she off the beat but she’s fine as fuck so I find the rhythm
No love is greater, in this whole world we made up
This love is made-up, it’s made-up
It’s made-up, it’s made-up, it’s made-up (say, aye)
I don’t know this bitch but I love this shit and we both feel splendid
And she loud as fuck so I grab and touch and she don’t get offended
They goin call the law if we don’t get lost in parking lot
She don’t like me dog, she just like the drugs my nigga, don’t get it twisted

[Bridge]
How many more can you give to me?
How many more can you give to me? I know you’re feelin me
Grinding and biting and kissing me
Who gives a fuck bout your history? nobody mentioned it
I coulda taken them all, I coulda taken them all, look at me dog
Look at me dead in the eyes, tell me you ain’t in love

[Hook]
She don’t give a fuck
She don’t ever stress me
We don’t really talk
All we do is sex and leave
No there’s no love

When we have drugs
When we have drugs

[Verse 2]
You my one and only, my one and only, I’m on one homie
I don’t know your name I just love that ass, and I’ll pull that pony
Said I hate the club, but I make the club when I walk into it
Said you hate the drink, but you take the drink when I offer fluid
No love is greater, in this whole world we made up
This love is made-up, it’s made-up, it’s made-up, it’s made-up, it’s made-up
I can say right now that I’ll lay you down, I got lots of rubbers
I don’t give a fuck, you don’t give a fuck, we was made for each other
Your friend ain’t cute but my nigga’s a trooper, he’ll take the L
I’m high as fuck and you high as fuck so we parasailing

[Bridge]
How many more can you give to me? How many more can you give to me? I know you’re feelin me
Grinding and biting and kissing me, who gives a fuck bout your history, nobody mentioned it
I coulda taken them all, I coulda taken them all, look at me dog
Look at me dead in the eyes, tell me you ain’t in love

[Hook]
She don’t give a fuck

[Verse 1]
Kim plays with the heart strings
Late nights in the basement
Kills me with them soft notes
Offbeat placements
So sweet with the long notes
Blue dream with the light glow
I'll wait for the next show
But if you leave then I might roll
On your marks
When you're ready
Let me start
Okay, two shots and a slow dance
We walk to your home stand
Keep up, keep up, keep up if you can

[Pre-Hook]
Something different ain't it
Nothing like we planned
This ain't complicated

[Hook]
All up in the air, all up in the air
We walk in the same directions with no common plans
Just the nature of a man, prob'ly cover good good good
All up in the air
All up in the air
And if it's love, then it's love
And if it's not love then it's all love
All up in the air, All up in the air
And if it's love, then it's real
And if it's not love then it's no deal
All up in the air, all up in the air

All up in the air

[Verse 2]

Freelance in your hometown and it's good work now
Set it all down
(set it all down)
Set it all, set it all, set it all back down
(yeah) On your marks
When you're ready
Let me start, (okay)
Smooth talking and they stare
How often are you here?
Keep on, keep on, keep on if you care

[Hook]
Something different ain't it?

All up in the air, all up in the air
All up in the air, all up in the air

[Chorus]
Ooh, champagne pourin' down
Arms, legs wrapped around you
Ooh, champagne, let it fall down
Arms, legs keep grabbing

[Verse 1]
See, I be catchin' you starin', be careful
The idle mind is a dangerous place to be left in
But keep your eyes on me
Yeah, your heart don't stand a chance
It feels like it's been far too long
Your knees can't hold your legs
Your feet just want to pace
The eyes keep me all in a trance
Let me ask you
Would you leave it all in the back of your head
Or all in the palm of my hand?
Ain't nobody holding you back
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?
Your heart don't stand a chance
Your knees just want to break
Your eyes keep me all in a trance
And let me ask you
I know the approach is so far from what you're used to
But you know it
And do I hold a candle to the last one over your moon?
Baby, of course I do
And I'm not closing my tab
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?
Your heart don't stand a chance

[Chorus]
Ooh, champagne pourin' down
Arms, legs wrapped around you
Ooh, champagne, let it fall down
Arms, legs keep grabbing

[Verse 2]
Two-step in the corridor
Spinning the greatest hits of Hall & Oates
Open of chronic smoke
I know my time will flee
But your heart don't stand a chance
It feels like it's been far too long
The moment is all that we have
My meter should be up by the half
A ticket is the least of my cares
So let me ask you
Am I dreaming?
Mind on a tip of a cloud
Or is it real as the stone in your crown?
Say, ain't nobody towing my Jag
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?
Your heart don't stand a chance
I'm waiting for the white flag
You're talking with the blunt in your hand
And won't you pass that?
I know, in the morning
The sunlight cover your wounds
But I'm hoping that I look the same as the way you always knew
Baby, your course, I flew
But I'm not over what we had
Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl?
Your heart don't stand a chance

[Chorus]
Ooh, champagne pourin' down
Arms, legs wrapped around you
Ooh, champagne, let it fall down
Arms, legs keep grabbing

[Skit]
I remember being tumbled around and not being able to get to the surface where the air was
And looking down and seeing my body spinning around in the white water



[Verse 1: Nocando]
I was up in Berlin
Maybe it was Belgium
Talking up a whirlwind
Pretty young thing
Nobody's for certain
Riding her wave
God, she was surfin'
Two hearts hurtin'
Broke beat perfect
[?] to like pain
Sweatin' like rain on my (chain)
Left a little stain
Was she runnin' game?
I know I was runnin' game but

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I wanna live
I wanna give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions
I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold
(Gold all in my watch, gold all in my chain)
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
(Gold all in my watch, gold all in my chain)

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Searching for something
So we entered through the matter to find what we needed
It's so much harder than I fathomed, my logic divided
If all I wanted was a hit, then I'd probably be famous
To be respected by my peers was the reason I did it
Go five years in the struggle, ain't much to a nigga
When one week of livin' lavish can fuck up your liver
Who needs provision when you covered in diamonds and pendents?
Who needs the temporaries when bitches are dyin' to get it?
I copped the ring, I caught feelin', abandoned the bride
Sold that shit for half the price just to keep on the lights
Look in the eyes and be surprised if there's anything worth mentioning
Broken-hearted in misery, pity
But while I dwell, I owe a lot of niggas
Before I finished this sentence, I promised to make bail

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
(Gold all in my watch, gold all in my chain)
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
(Gold all in my watch, gold all in my chain)

[Verse 3: Milo]
Here it goes, another diatribe from Leopold
Screaming at minors not to make the same mistakes when we're old
I was a miner for pyrite
Now I'm in PriceRite buying pie tins and thin mints
Shin splints for a retired digger downsized signal thin hints that I'm a retired nigga
I'm just looking for a woman who will let me sing in the shower now
For a woman who doesn't have Dwight Eisenhower brows
I feel dumb listening to Neil Young, I recline
The spiel was sung and still I decline
The laughing track was always lethal
And I can never remember what size you like your frappuccinos
You say those heart pains were a fluke
Praying to Saint Luke in the morning
Never glanced up from reading Marmaduke, I'm in mourning



[Verse 1]
Take a walk
Before it gets dark
Little angel
There's no need to worry
Shouldn't be too painful
At last, I see the roses
West bound on a cold train
I'm headed home for the closing

[Verse 2]
Take a walk
Before it gets dark
There's no need to worry
Shouldn't be too painful
At last, I see the roses
West bound on a cold train
I'm headed home for the closing

[Outro]
Drifting towards the ocean
Some place where I can lay my head down
Are closing



[Verse 1]
I don't miss her one bit
Maybe a little bit
Somedays I think about it
But I get over it real quick
It's too late to make amends
We could never be friends
I don't miss a warm bed
I miss that whip

[Hook]
Damn, that whip
I miss that whip
That whip, that whip, that whip
I miss that whip

[Verse 2]
She used to scoop me from the train station
Have a smoothie and a rented movie, pre-rolled J waitin'
(That whip, I miss that whip)
She didn't care about the reach
From the De Longpre to Long Beach
(That whip, that whip, that whip, that whip
I miss that whip)

[Hook]
And damn, that whip
I miss that whip
That whip, that whip, that whip
I miss that whip



[Intro]
(A little surfer music, baby
A blast from your golden past)

[Interlude: Sample]
You know I see you from afar, right?
Hey, it's alright
Listen, I would've [?]

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's alright with me
Just send it off, and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last phase
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be lite weight

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
You know I really can't fuss about it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't fuss about it

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's alright with me
Just send it off, and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last phase
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be lite weight

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
(You know I see you from afar, right?)
You know I really can't fuss about it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't fuss about it

[Interlude: Sample]
(Thought you might've wanted to say somethin'
So I was comin' up to you
It's cool if I come up to you, right?
[?])

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's alright with me
Just send it off, and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last phase
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be lite weight

[Outro]
(Hey, you got a light?
Oh, yes, here you are
Thanks, you want a toke?
No, no thanks
This stuff is getting harder to get
Johnny
Yeah-)



[Verse 1]
We must've been together
I bet you knew just who I was
Somewhere around your second lifetime
We danced on Persian rugs
We fucked and fell in love

[Pre Hook]
And that is who we are
Too familiar, so long
Energy carried on and on
Ripples in the pond
Like a mirror, so long
Energy carried on and on

[Hook]
Hey, I think I luh you
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do
I think I luh you
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do

[Verse 2]
Few shots, then we rid them off
Goofed off, [?] hit the loft
With the Scope on I can kill them all
We can be lovers two souls in a different life
But you know we done here been here before
How did you know we only sip clear liquor
Smoke purple endo, top floor level
Type of shit that get that shit
Flown across the pond

[Verse 3]
I think I love you ooooh
We must have been together
It's something like I thought it was
And  what a last impression
You left me with an open door
I want more and more

[Pre Hook]
It's who we are
Too familiar, so long
Energy carried on and on
Ripples in the pond
Like a mirror, so long
Energy carried on and on

[Hook]
Hey, I think I luh you
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do
I think I luh you
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do

[Post Hook]
Energy carried on and on (on and on)
Energy carried on and on (on and on)
Energy carried on and on (on and on)
Energy carried on and on (on and on)

[Bridge]
In the night I can't quite put my finger on
We believe that we are star crossed
Forgive me if I am wrong
Forgive me if I am wrong, spinning off
Energy carried on and on

[Outro]
Energy carried on and on
Energy carried on and on



[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I said it's worth more mentally
When you can touch but keep the peace
Its simple, but deceptively
I feel  your warmth, I know your taste
I fell in love with your word
I know that you're worth it
I really love when it's earned
It seems like you want this
And when it's done to the dirt
Who could regret this?
I fell in love with your word
It seems like you're worth it

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good if it kills me
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good 'til tomorrow
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
(Uh huh, you know what I'm saying, so it's like...)
I'm learning to take it slow but I don't wanna though
Especially tonight you look phenomenal, simply astronomical
I had a moment where I zoned and thought of us alone
I had you moaning, yeah, I wanna jump your bones
But it takes more than a boner for us to make a happy home
But when I grow up big and strong, I sure don't wanna live alone
So fuck the phone, I cross the ocean in a boat
I have to row cause flowing's too slow
And both motors are broken
And the sky opens up and I don't have a raincoat
Cause I threw everything I own out for this hand-written note
That says "I wanna make it work", that might not even work
Cause do I really believe that two people on this Earth are meant to be?
Eventually, I guess we'll see but in the meantime let's roll this weed
Turn out free time to you and me time
Turn our free time to you and me time
Let's turn our free time to, you know

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good if it kills me
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good 'til tomorrow
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
It feel good don't it?
A little longer
I need you all night
And we a one now
And she's alone now
And I'mma get it right
A little longer
Until we get it right
Until we get it right
I wanna make it work
And make it good 'til you feel it
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good if it kills me
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good 'til tomorrow
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good

[Intro]
Pack up
I'm straight
Enough

[Bridge]
Oh say say say
Oh say say say
Oh say say say
Oh say say say
Oh say say say

[Chorus]
Wait...They don't love you like I love you
Wait...They don't love you like I love you
Maps
Wait...They don't love you like I love you


Made off
Don't stray
My kind's your kind
I'll stay the same
Pack up
Don't stray
Oh say say say
Oh say say say

[Chorus]
Wait...they don't love you like I love you
Wait...they don't love you like I love you
Maps
Wait...they don't love you like I love you
Wait...they don't love you like I love you
Maps
Wait...they don't love you like I love you

[Hook]
I get the feelin' that ya might be
Did I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong
But I'm feelin' that ya might be
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
And I'm thinkin' you'd like to be
Every word I speak got you floatin' off your seat
And I'm knowin' that you like me
Oh you high baby, high baby

[Verse 1]
Okay, the blunt is rolled up
Nobody lit it
Said even if we don't puff
Won't make a difference
My body's leaning to the right baby
You tell me 'go on and spend the night baby?'
No, I don't even know ya
I know enough to get you high baby

[Pre-Hook]
I got about a half an ounce of that tree
Got about a half a cup of that lean
I said go on and kick your feet up
I'mma go ahead and twist the weed up
She said cool to say what I think
I said go and do what you feel
She said bend me over that sink
I said damn your wish is my will

[Hook]
I get the feelin' that ya might be
Did I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong
But I'm feelin' that ya might be
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
And I'm thinkin' you'd like to be
Every word I speak got you floatin' off your seat
And I'm knowin' that you like me
Oh you high baby, high baby

[Verse 2]
Okay, I'm feelin' so stuck
Laid up on the couch, got fingers in your mouth
Girl, bring it closer
Before my high comes down, my high comes down
Girl, I can barely keep my eyes open
You say you tryna get your spine blown in
No, I don't even know ya
I know enough to get you high floatin'

[Pre-Hook]
I got about a half an ounce of that tree
Got about a half a cup of that lean
I said go on and kick your feet up
I'mma go ahead and twist the weed up
She said cool to say what I think
I said go and do what you feel
She said bend me over that sink
I said damn your wish is my will

[Breakdown]
Feelin' that ya might be
Oh tell me are you high, baby
I get the feelin' that ya
Tell me you high as me?
Oh tell me are you high?
Tell me you high? Are you high, are you high as me?
Oh tell me are you high?
Tell me you are, tell me are you high as me?

[Hook]
I get the feelin' that ya might be
Did I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong
But I'm feelin' that ya might be
And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope
And I'm thinkin' you'd like to be
Every word I speak got you floatin' off your seat
And I'm knowin' that you like me
Oh you high baby, high baby



[Miki Dora]
I don't know, doesn't make a difference to me
My whole life is an escape, my whole life is this way, might drop into, set the whole thing up, pull out the bottom, turn, pull up into it, and shoot for my life, going for broke man
And behind me, all the shit goes over my back, the screaming parents, teachers, screaming teachers, police, priests, politicians, knee boarders, wind surfers
They're all going over the falls into the reef, head first into the fucking reef, bwah, and I'm sure of my life
And when it starts to close out I pull out, to the bottom out, to the back, and I pick up another one and do the same damn thing



[Intro]
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah

[Verse 1]
Went from chicken shit ho to magnificent pro
Shoppin' bags at the grove, MCM on the coat
Had to clean up her nose, had to dream up some goals
Swimming in Fendi business that's probably owned
I was walking down 6th, she pulled up in a 6
She said "Hop in this whip," I said "Bitch, you the feds"
She said "Baby, don't trip," then she rolled me a spliff
Showed me pics of her kids, then she slid me some bread like

[Bridge]
It's yours, babe, cause I got big money
So if you need something, don't be ashamed
It's yours, babe, cause you got big lovin'
So go and spend somethin', I said okay
I said okay (All I need... good love)
I said okay (Hey)
I said okay (All a nigga need, yeah... good love)
I said okay (Uh-huh)

[Hook]
And now
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach (Spending this bitch's money)
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach (Spending this bitch's money)

[Verse 2]
It's too good to be true, I ain't got nothin' to do
I got keys to the coupe, I just spent all this loot
She said "Get what you want," she said "Live how you do
But If I catch you with other bitches, your throat - I'mma slit"
I said "It's yours, babe, I put your name on this dick"
But I was lyin' of course, I'm slammin' chick after chick
Soon as she gave me the Porsche, I bang her right on the strip
I copped some white on the 5th and pulled up right on a bitch like

[Bridge]
It's yours, babe, cause I got big money
So if you need something, don't be ashamed
It's yours, babe, cause you got big lovin'
So go and spend somethin', I said okay
I said okay (All I need... good love)
I said okay (Hey)
I said okay (All a nigga need, yeah... good love)
I said okay (Uh-huh)

[Hook]
And now
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach (Spending this bitch's money)
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, I'm swimming in milk n' honey
Swi-swimming in milk n' honey, swimming in milk n' honey
I'm swimming in milk n' honey, swi-swimming in milk n' honey
Dick in this bitch's stomach (Spending this bitch's money)

[Verse 3]
I got gold, I got ice, I got Polo and Nikes
I got lean, I got Sprite, 'bout to spend a couple racks in one night
And mothafuckas wanna tell me take it light
Mothafuckas wanna tell me take it easy
I don't need no one's advice, niggas all wanna be me
I was riding down 6th and got stop by the pigs
They said "Hop out the whip," I said "Fuck did I do?"
They said "Pop up the trunk," I'm like pop up this dick
They said "Don't make us shoot," they said "Don't make a move"
I was high as a kite, I had Xannies and white
I looked up at the light, like what the fuck is my life
They said my plates ain't legit, so they opened my shit
And when they opened my shit, it was snow in a fridge
I felt dumb as a brick, I had no idea
She had stolen the whip and this bitch had warrants and shit and
This bitch pulled multiple licks and this bitch had bodies on burners
And when I called her from my cell, the only message I heard was

[Outro]
(It's yours, babe)
I mean you gotta do what you gotta do
Don't scr... don't say a fucking word
(It's yours, babe)
No, you don't say shit
Now I'm gone, I'm on a plane, babe
(It's yours, babe)
But no, you wanted to spend the money
You wanted to live, you know, wanted to live large
You got new sneakers and all that
So now you deal with them bricks
(It's yours, babe)
Na-na-na-nah, nah, I can't do nothing for you
I told you I'm on a G5, I'm gone
I'm too gone, I gotta go now
You say my fucking name - you a dead man
(I said okay)
I said okay
I said okay
I said okay
I said okay



[Produced by Anderson .Paak]

[Verse 1]
I need the right one
With a bright imagination
Someone to talk to
Somebody patient
I want a cold piece
I want a love sensation
I want the mind first
I'll make the body wait for it (wait for it)
You could be the right one
With a little dedication
Gotta make me follow through
Gotta make me chase it
Ohh I want a stone groove
I wanna love sensation
Someone to hold to
Someone to play with

[Hook]
Cause lately
My whole being
Just wants
What it needs
And I don’t mind
(I need it
I just need, need, need)

[Verse 2]
I want the right one
Car keys and a cake dish
Gotta take that (pipe work)
Gotta make me (taste it)
I mean amazing
You want my last name (say it)
Wanna have my baby (say it)
I'll take you all places
I want the world stage
Certified classic
Big planes
Light baggage (work)
I got the long reach (work, work)
You got that good conversation (work)
You such a cold piece
I wonder if you're taken

[Hook]
Cause lately
My whole being
Just wants
What it needs
And I don’t mind
(I need it
I just need, need, need)
Say it, say it (I just) I need (vamp)



[Verse 1]
If it's really what you needed, love
Baby this right here's a world of fun
But you can get this hit whenever you want
So here you are now
And it's on now
And it's on right now
Here you are now
And it's on now
And it's on right now
Here we are now
And it's on now
And it's on

[Chorus]
Suddenly suddenly suddenly
Off the ground
I'm lifting it up
Sending it sending it sending it
Off the ground
I'm lifting it up
Cooling it cooling it cooling it
Cool it down
I'm lifting you off the ground
I'm getting you off
It's on right now
Suddenly suddenly suddenly
Off the ground (off ground)
I'm lifting it up (up)
Sending it sending it sending it
Off the ground (off ground)
I'm lifting it up (up)
Cooling it cooling it cooling it
Cool it down (cool down)
I'm lifting you off the ground (off ground)
I'm getting you off (up down)
It's on right now


[Bridge]
Send it off, send it off, in and out
Give it all, give it all, give it out
There we are, there we are, here and now
Let it all come out, let it all come out

[Verse 2]
I can move it to wherever you are
We can live this life forever more
Baby this right here is a one on one
But you can get this dick whenever you want
So here we are now
And it's on now
And it's on right now
Here we are now
And it's on now
And it's on right now

[Chorus]
Suddenly suddenly suddenly
Off the ground
I'm lifting it up
Sending it sending it sending it
Off the ground

Cooling it cooling it cooling it
Cool it down
I'm lifting you off the ground

Suddenly suddenly suddenly


[Outro]
Let it be yours, let it carry you
Sweep the fear from your heart
If you need it then go there
If you see what you want, then go there
Let it be yours, let it carry you
Sweep the fear from your heart
If you need it then go there

[Pre Hook: Anderson .Paak]
Ugh, that what you need? (ugh say)
Ugh, you need
Say, is that what you need?
Ugh, you need

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
All I see is angels, demons
Soft lights a bitch sounds
From your first dream that be a sinner

[Verse 1: Anderson. Paak]
Running like your running for the gold one (gold one)
Back and forth of course it's never no one
They just want to frame you in the same shit (same shit)
Never been afraid to let it go (let it go)

[Hook 2: Anderson .Paak]
I just want to run it on the canvas
Brushes stroke is stroking but she go nuts
Speak of me as something you can ride on
Guess how many pages put you open up the gate and get it

[Hook 3: Anderson .Paak]
All day, no breaks
All day, no breaks
Mix it, clip it, switch it then I change it (All day, no breaks)
All day, no breaks

[Post Hook: Anderson .Paak]
Paint, paint, paint
Change it
Paint, paint
Ch' Change it

(Ehh Ohh Ehh)

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
All I see is angels, demons
Soft lights a bitch sounds
From your first dream that be a sinner
Excuse for me not to to keep you creaming
Creaming, creaming, creaming, creaming

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Different, different colours that your changing (paint, paint)
A million ways a minute till it blows up (change it)
Fighting on your face, just face it (face it)
Take it till you say it
I am going to open up your place and paint it

[Hook 3: Anderson .Paak]
All day, no breaks
All day, no breaks
Mix it, clip it, switch it then
Change it, no breaks
All day, no breaks

[Pre Hook: Anderson .Paak]
Ugh, that what you need (ugh say)
Ugh, you need
Say, is that what you need?
Ugh, you need

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
All I see is angels, demons
Soft lights a bitch sounds
From your first your first dream be a sinner

[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak]
Looking like you woke up got a dreaming
Fishing where you living but there's no luck
Who can paint the picture like dali
Mixing different colours what I can do

[Hook 2: Anderson .Paak]
I just want to run it on your canvas
Stroking but she pushes stroking but she go nuts
Speak of me on something you can ride on
Guess how many stages put you open up the gates and get it

[Hook 3: Anderson .Paak]
All day, no breaks
All day, no breaks
Mix it, clip it, switch it then
Change it, no breaks
All day, no breaks

[Post Hook: Anderson .Paak]
Paint, paint

[Intro]
Well, you told me your whole life story in a few shorts
All the while I never knew the tone of your voice
A half an hour, I ramble on way too much (my love)
Alone with my own thoughts (my love)
(1, 2, 3, come on–) Enough is enough

[Verse 1]
There's a plain way to call it, but it's never that obvious for me
I'm in a communion, I got needs
The combination of all my life's complaints and a few strong drinks
I don't remember the parking lot
I just remember the song we sang
(Ooh, my love)
And the song we sang
(My love)

[Hook]
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on–
(Remember the song–)
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (my love)
Come on, you feel me (the parking lot)
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (my love)
1, 2, 3, come on–

[Verse 2]
Bring the corners from left to right
How many more will it take to get a crossfade?
Coming closer to midnight and I'm wide awake
And ain't you afraid to fade?
Couldn't wait to get you naked on the first date
But you made me wait
So it takes one to make one
The compromise we made
Please believe me, I don't recall the parking lot
I just remember the song we sang
And the song we sang
And the song we s–

[Hook]
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on–

[Interlude]
(Ooh, my love)
Come on, you feel me
(My love)
Come on–

[Hook]
(Remember the parking lot)
Come on, you feel me (my love)
Come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (my love)
1, 2, 3, come on–
Come on, you feel me (my love)
Come on, you feel me (the song we sang)
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (my love)
1, 2, 3, come on–

[Outro]
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
Come on, you f–
1, 2, 3–
Feel me

(Have mercy, baby!
Can you dig it? Can you dig it?)



[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Why the hell would you run this game?
Both my hands are tied
Afraid of thinking I dug my own grave
Fuck around with this
Strange and elusive, too afraid to lose it
I don't mind this pain
Most niggas want you for your candy
They'll never know just how long it takes
I wave my own pride
And put it all on the line

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
There I go, volunteering, punish me
Self inflicted pain, sickness over used
Way over used
Here I stay, hey, time to time
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
A little while longer
A bit more time
Why would you run these thoughts across my mind?
Please, relieve me
As cool as I remain
There's a point in which I'll lose my self restraint
Say, love, most niggas would've left you lonely
I fancy throwing it all away
I see it to my own demise
How much longer will I let it ride?

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
There I go, volunteering, punish me
Self inflicted pain, sickness over used
Will I let it ride? (Here I stay)
Here I stay, time to time
It must be what you put me through (yeah, time to time)
It must be what you put me through

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
Hey it must be (here I stay time to time)
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through



[Verse 1]
You cold, you cold, you the coldest
I just wanna know who put you on it
Homage to your teacher
Knowledge is the motherfucking key
New move, got a lot of 'em
Remember when you only knew how to ride on it
Now you be tossing it like Serena
And I'mma run it back like a re-run

[Hook]
Who put you on, who put you on to that?
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I put you on to that
Now look at you
Who put you on to that?
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I put you on to that

[Verse 2]
You know, you know, you my favourite
I be steady drinking with you baby
Long strokes to the promise
Remember you couldn't take it at all
New moves, got a lot of 'em
Tell me when the hell you got so long winded
Talking and walking just like a diva
Now you gon' hit them notes like Aretha

[Hook]
Who put you on, who put you on to that?
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I put you on to that
Now look at you
Who put you on to that?
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I put you on to that

[Outro]
Who put you on
Who put you on to that
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I put you on to that
Now look at you
Who put you on to that
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nothing
I put you on to that



[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of good health
I'm so tired of this roof and my bed
I'm so tired of cooked food and good moods
And good coup with AC to cruise
So tired of myself, my word and my wealth
Too big is my heart, too small are my cares
Then she said...
I'm so tired of making love
I'm so tired of being kissed
I'm so tired of making money
I'm so tired of this kush in my spliff, it don't make sense
I'm so tired of my family, my friends
I'm so tired of one night stands
So tired of living lavish, two birds in one nest
And being notorious

[Hook]
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there

[Verse 2]
I'm so tired of this scene
I'm so tired of this ocean, this breeze
So tired but can't close my eyes to find sleep
So tired of this dream (reoccurring)
Your smile, your charm
Your patience, loyalty
Your love...ain't you tired of me?
To have it all, but not at all complete
Wanting you is all that ever drives my beat
That never-ending, ever-tempting, tipping-over
All my energy...
It's all that ever drives my being

[Hook]
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there
Even when you're gone
I can still feel you
I want it more than air
And don't you care?
But that's not fair
The only thing you ever really loved
Was right there, right there, right there



[Skit]
"Besides surfing, what do you think about? Love, for instance?
I don't think about it, I make it"

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I want you by my lonesome, above this crowded space
It's easier to hold some, when no one's in the way
Well if no one's in the running for the part
I'd love to pick a day
To show you the main room (Whenever's a good time)
I don't need a bouquet, I just need proper space
Homie three blocks away, I got bottles for days
I got tropical haze, go ahead and wave bye
Let me help with your coat, grab a hold of my arm
Tell them niggas to move, tell your sister you fine

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Cause baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
As crazy as it may seem, it's not too hard to read
It's too many ifs and maybes, and not enough certainty
Well if no one's putting numbers on the board
I'd love to take a swing, might even graze you
But I don't mean any harm, I'm just speaking my mind
Take a look at that moon, 'bout as bright as your eyes
We got plenty of space, go ahead and recline
Take a puff of that, get a sip of this wine
Yeah, feelin' good?

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Cause baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?

[Verse 3: The Game]
She had a bright smile, big white teeth, I mean
Whiter than her white T, remind me of wifey
Met her at the studio, sort of like a high buyer
She told me she had game so we connected like the wifi
She had this Asian swagger ‘bout her, so I call her mai tai
Started followin' her, she was the only thing on my timeline
And there was this one picture, her in the swimsuit
That made a nigga want to beat it up, and I intend to
But I'ma have to put in work, baby girl then drink it all
Face like Mona Lisa, I'm just tryna be the wall to hang on
I ain't got no patience, I can't wait long
She come and see me, but she don't stay long
And that's the problem, she a good girl
Maybe it's too much smoke in the room
And she don't want that Mary Jane in her Vidal Sassoon
So I'mma take a minute, and walk her to her Uber
Got a bullet in my heart, and she the shooter
Ay, .Paak

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Baby there's room in here
Just enough for two in here
Ain't nobody but you and me in here
Yeah, what can we do in here?
What can we do? What can we do?



I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back

And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette
And the message coming from my eyes
Says leave it alone

Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell

And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do
And the feeling coming from my bones
Says find a home

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more
And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me go back home



[Verse 1]
Yeah, all of that ass you carrying
—you gotta be shitting me
All that body that you came with
But where are you mentally?
I know ya hear it all the time
But you ain't gonna hear from me
I just wanna focus on them lovelies
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?

[Pre-Chorus]
They say the heart is underneath
Underneath the guarded insecurities
I finally found the key
Underneath the garments that's the double D's

[Chorus]
Open your heart, X spots the mark, baby
Don't turn around, make an ass out yourself, baby
Open your heart
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?

[Verse 2]
I don't mind them little bitty berries
You my Ju-Ju-Be
I don't need nothing to distract me
From this connectivity
You know I see it all the time
The same old shit to me
I just wanna know what's under
That tender titty meat

[Pre-Chorus]
They say the heart is underneath
Underneath the guarded insecurities
I finally found the key
Underneath the garments that's the double D's

[Chorus]
Open your heart, X spots the mark, baby
Don't turn around, make an ass out yourself, baby
Open your heart
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?

[Verse 3]
Before you go and pop that bottom baby
Before you go and get butt naked baby
I know you gotta little bit of baggage baby
Never mind I'ma look past it
Big cans in the cooler, let me handle it baby
Two jugs I'm gonna start grasping you baby
Separation between truth and the fake
You can get a new rack for five k
You can get a rapper by Friday
You gon' have to replace being cheapskate, just save it
Can a nigga squeeze or should I just be safe?
(Yeah for-sure) Tell me what it reads on the expiration date
(Well I just got them, should be good for about ten years or so)
I know you feel the D when a nigga deep in the hole
But do you feel the peace when I'm sucking them, baby doll?
(Can you fuck me already?)

[Chorus]
Open your heart, baby, X spots the mark, baby
Don't turn around, make an ass out yourself, baby
Open your heart
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?
Open your heart, baby, X spots the mark, baby
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?

[Skit]
For me I can't live in the Northern Hemisphere
I must live, back, back in the time
Where all these animals, all this sea life, all the oysters, shellfish, crustaceans, everything is part of the smell
Everything has come into the focus of the whole experience



I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images and when
We kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

And true, it may seem like a stretch
But its thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now," they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now," but we'll stay...

I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat it sounded thin
Upon listening

And that frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now," they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now," but we'll stay...

They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now," they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now," but we'll stay...

They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now."
They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now."



[Hook]
A bird with the word came to me
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
And now I look what's taking over me
Couldn't fake it if I wanted to
I had to wake up just to make it through
I got my patience and I'm making do
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
I choose to follow what the greatest do
A bird with the word came to me
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
And now I look what's taking over me
Couldn't fake it if I wanted to
I had to wake up just to make it through
I got my patience and I'm making do
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
I choose to follow what the greatest do

[Verse 1]
I'm repping for the longest cycle, mmm
My uncles had to pay the cost, mmm
My sister used to sing to Whitney, mmm
My mama caught the gambling bug, mmm
We came up in a lonely castle, mmm
My papa was behind them bars, mmm
We never had to want for nothing, mmm
Said all we ever need is love, mmm
We see the same things
We sing the same songs
We feel the same grief
Bleed the same blood
You grew up in the home beside me
I always had a friend to call
How could I make it here without you? Mmm
I pray I leave before you're gone

[Hook]
A bird with a word came to me
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
And now I look, what's taking over me
Couldn't fake it if I wanted to
I had to wake up, just to make it through
I got my patience and I'm making do
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
I choose to follow what the greatest do
A bird with the word came to me
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
And now my luck was taking over me
Couldn't fake it if I wanted to
I had to wake up just to make it through
I got my patience and I'm making do
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
I choose to follow what the greatest do

[Outro]
Hey, my little youth is crying
I'm almost home, almost home
Look no further riots, mmm
Working my fingers to the bone
See I do the best I can, mmm
Mama was a farmer, mmm
Papa was a goner, mmm



[Spoken Intro]
Venice, California
Known then as "Venice: Slum by the Sea"

[Verse 1]
There's no need to wear these shades when I drive
I need to see the leap before the stride
There's so much more that can happen
I'm sure that you can imagine
I live around here
Let me show you how to walk it, stop the traffic
Them two legs will get you right for action with good brain
That get you all the answers
That get you all the cash and fashion, just bat your lashes and

[Chorus]
Tell me where you wanna go
But I don't really think that it could get much better
The city I love, city I love, city I love
You tellin' me you wanna break free, I bet you never
Bet you never
Powder your nose, love
Smoke if you want to
Put your feet in the water
The city belongs to you girl
It's all for you
Tell me where you wanna go (It's all for you)

[Verse 2]
So when you're living the dream is it hard to see
Does your heart beat heavenly
I think it's much more than the green leaf but it helps of course
There's only one season
Can you believe the way that they talk about my paradise
We don't need that kind of vibe, no no

[Chorus]
Don't tell me where you're from girl
Tell me where you wanna get to
The city I love, city I love, city I love
You wanna break free on me, I bet you never
Bet you never
Powder your nose, love
Smoke if you want to
Put your feet in the water
The city belongs to you girl
It's all for you

[Outro]
Don't tell me where you're from girl
Tell me where you wanna get to
Put your feet in the water
The city belongs to you girl
It's all for you
Tell me where you wanna go (It's all for you)

I enjoy some of the old and I enjoy the new
And if I can find a balance between it, that's where I find my satisfaction

[Intro: Timan Family Choir & (Anderson .Paak)]

Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now, keep dreaming
Don't stop now (yeah), keep dreaming

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I'm on my fifth brew and my rent's due
Sixth and west roof
I can see it all
Hold on to my hand, that's my little dude
Look at Kenzo, swagging like his paw
One for the occasion and get ya good suit
Fuck your reservation
Bitch, I brought 'em all
Look at where you came from, Californication
Since a little baby skating in boogie boards
And raiding your cookie jar, my radio analog
I wanted them Nike's
Mama got me Lugz

[Chorus 1: Anderson .Paak & Timan Family Choir]
(And all)
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns
And who cares your daddy couldn't be here?
Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
One for the occasion
Fuck your reservation
Call up all the haters, It's official
Californication, Ever since a baby
Radio and the cable
I got the dish, too

[Chorus 1: Anderson .Paak & Timan Family Choir]
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch

Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns

[Bridge: Talib Kweli]
This is the music that you gotta feel
Gave you the truth before I got a deal
No rabbit in a hat. It ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield
More like a panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale
Word to the free lunch. Who knew what we would become?
Who would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?
Yeah, this is the music that you gotta feel
Yeah, gave you the truth before I got a deal
No rabbit in a hat. It ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield
More like a panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale
Word to the free lunch. Who knew what we would become?
Who would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Used to be scared of all my fears
'Till I woke up from this nightmare
Now what become of a dream deferred
Now until we leave this earth
The music make your speakers burst
I always put my people first
It's deep how when I speak they say
I'm preaching like I lead a church
No proper opposition, competition gonna need a nurse
My job as an artist is making miracles
To show you how to struggle poetic and make it lyrical
Crystallize the thought to make it clear to you
And make the revolution irresistable

[Chorus 1: Anderson .Paak]
This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch

And who cares your daddy couldn't be here?
Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns

Oh my gosh guys calm down
Stop it

[Skit]
Now evolution: Where it all going? Is it coming to an end or it it just beginning
There was one fellow who know'd Malibu quite well at a certain time in history
And I doubt if very few people are able to find these types of conditions again
Due to crowds and controls and much bureaucracy
But there are other areas which are magnificent, treasures of this world
And for somebody with adventure and excitement in their lives, and they have a lot of excitement and adventure
They can find this way of living



[Part 1: The Season]
[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Hook]
My faith is buried somewhere underneath the town
(Until it’s paid for)
Strawberry season, my sweetheart is coming ‘round
(I hear it rain and pour)
How did you find me here? It must be perfect timing
(Forever grateful)
If I didn’t love you then I damn sure love you now
(Fruit of your labor)

[Verse 1]
Say ain’t shit change but the bank statements
Spent the summer in the wave with the beach babies
Threw your chula in the buggie
With the top down up the PCH
I’m heading north, I hope it doesn't rain
Went from playing community ball to balling with the majors
(Oh, what you major?)
Yeah nigga I ran bases, pitch flame
I call plays, remove labels
And fuck fame, that killed all my favorite entertainers
(Nothing short of amazing, ooh yeah)
But I’m short on my patience
See, I don’t play that shit, I don’t ever forget
And don’t forget that dot, nigga you paid for it
I spent years being called out my name
Living under my greatness
But what don’t kill me is motivation

[Hook]
My faith is buried somewhere underneath the town
(Until it’s paid for)
Strawberry season, my sweetheart is coming ‘round
(I hear it rain and pour)
How did you find me here? It must be perfect timing
(Forever grateful)
If I didn’t love you then I damn sure love you now
(Fruit of your labor)

[Part 2: Carry Me]
[Produced by Callum Connor]

[Intro]
Yeah, say, yeah

[Hook]
Six years old, I tried my first pair of Jordans on
("Momma, can you carry me?")
It was late in the fall I caught a glimpse of my first love, my God
("Momma, can you carry me?")
Knees hit the floor, screams to the Lord
Why they had to take my ma? ("Momma, carry me?")
To the early morn ("Momma, can you carry me?")
To the early morning ("Momma, can you carry me?")

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, gather ‘round, hustlers, that's if you’re still living
And get on down before the judge give the sentence
A few more rounds before the feds come and get you
Is you gonna smile when your date gets issued?
You know them feds taking pictures
Your mom’s in prison, your father need a new kidney
You family’s splitting, rivalries between siblings
If cash ain’t king it's damn sure the incentive
And good riddance

[Interlude: Sample]
[Q]: Is the element of danger an important factor for the members of your peer group?
[A]: Yes, you might say that. Why don’t you give it a try and find out for yourself?

[Verse 3]
Bout the year Drizzy and Cole dropped
Before K.Dot had it locked
I was sleeping on the floor, newborn baby boy
Tryna get my money pot so wifey wouldn’t get deported
Cursing the heavens, falling out of orbit
Tryna roll this seven, tryna up my portion
What about your goals? What about your leverage?
So they don’t force you into some hole
What’s the meaning of my fortune reading?
When I crack the cookie all it said was “keep dreaming”
When I look at my tree, I see leaves missing
Generations of harsh living and addiction
I came to visit during the seven year stint
But they wouldn’t let me in because my license suspended
Now I’m scraping the pennies just to kiss you on your cheek
It’s gonna be a couple weeks before I get it
I know you miss me

[Hook]
Six years old I tried my first pair of Jordans on
(Momma can you carry me?)
It was late in the fall I caught a glimpse of my first love, my God
(Momma can you carry me?)
Knees hit the floor, screams to the Lord
Why they had to take my ma? (Momma can you carry me?)
To the early morn (Momma can you carry me?)
To the early morning (Momma can you carry me?)

[Break]
(Momma can you carry me?)
(Momma can you carry me?)
(Momma can you carry me?)
(Momma can you carry me?)

[Bridge]
Yeah, oh, oh, oh
And one of these is my rise
One of these is my downfall
And I’m the one to make it right
I wanna make it right
And one of these is my rise
One of these is my downfall
And I’m the one to make it right
I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right

[Refrain]
(Momma can you carry me?)
To the early morning
(Momma can you carry me?)
To the early morning
(Momma can you carry me?)
Oh lord
(Momma can you carry me?)
(Momma can you carry me?)
(Momma can you carry me?)
(Momma can you carry me?)
(Momma can you carry me?)

[Outro: Sample: Psychologist + Leroy the Masochist]
I see here they call you a masochist
I like pain
Can you be specific? What kind of pain do you like?
Any kind of pain



[Intro]
Yes, lord, yeah

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Tried to tell niggas, in 2012, nigga
Working hand to hand and no avail
Volume one was too heavy for you frail niggas
So I got leaned like codeine and pills
It's the visionary, in the vintage Chevy
It's been a while but wow you still care
Free Nash 'til they pass out obituaries
In bold caps, "your bitch-ass was not there"
And I can do anything but move backwards
The hardest thing is to keep from being distracted
My big sister still claiming me on them taxes
Tell Uncle Sam I just need a second to add this
Gave my momma ten racks
And she packed and went to Chumash with it
Quadruple the worth and give me half of it
Half of it I took in the back of the air mattress
A quarter stash was stashed in a box with the Air Maxes
The rest got lost in Saks with my wifey, no BM
Whack niggas dropping links in my DM
Bad bitches up and down a nigga TL
I'm glad that you finally made it to the future but you're late
And the price is through the muthafuckin' roof
If you want you could wait outside the building
I ain't takin' no more meetings

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Stepped in the waters
The water was cold
Chilled my body
But not in my soul

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
I bring you greetings from the first church of Boom Baptists
United Fellowship of Free Nationals
Residing pastor is .Paak
And the first lady is a bad bitch
With slanted eyelids and thick ass
Sunglasses, Martin Luther King fan for you bitch niggas
Sweating on my Patent Leathers
Pressure turned their feather weight into a Cinderella
I ain't seen the ground in days since I grew propellers
We'll do one better
Word to the liquor that killed my grandpa liver
I know you finally look proud, a nigga smiling
To every hundred niggas that came and gone missing
Only a handful will go the distance
I swear I seen this shit coming as if I was living up under the plumbing
While niggas was riffing and mumbling 'bout, what they could do
I was cooking gumbo whipping the voodoo
I was in the jungle running with Zulu's
We was looking past the struggle while life was moving so fast
You had to be sharp as a Ginsu
To the top of the food group
Doing what I want and how I should too

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Stepped in the waters
The water was cold
Chilled my body
But it didn't touch my soul
Stepped in the waters
The water was cold
Chilled my body
But it didn't touch my soul

[Outro]
Ladies in gentlemen, the most fantastic day in history
Would you boys mind explaining the cause
Of what made this great park go underneath this hood
Take a look at this

[Verse]
I can't wait for the moment you can take off
I pray you don't have to cut my time short
I would rather not say much
But if I do, it will be forward
I can't pull no punches, baby doll
The gods have approved
The universe is in tune with me and you
That's why we here involved
I'm too in love
What you do this for?
Your body moves and fluid motion
Hands in two and two
Who's it for? Ooh, it's yours
I don't know if I'm the one you want to stay with
But I know that I'm the only one who makes you cum

[Hook]
And as soon as I break down the wall
I'm riding the wave of your waterfall
As soon as I break down the wall
I'm riding the wave of your waterfall
As soon as I break down the wall
I'm riding the wave of your waterfall

[Outro]
Ooh, don't touch me baby
Don't touch me baby
Wait, I'm okay, I'm alright
Give me space, don't touch me baby



[Instrumental]



[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
(You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'
You know I'm only fuckin' with you
(I bet you I was only thinkin' if I)
If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you
(You know I can't do nothin' with you)
You know I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth
No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Say, I should take this heart and pawn it at the auction
I don't need it, I'mma slay this bitch and take ya shoppin'
'Cause what good is any heart if it can break in pieces?
I would rather have no feelings, than cryin' and sobbin'
When I met you, I was broke as the rope on the faucet
I had dreams that I would blow like a Nintendo Cartridge
I was hungry, I was dirty, I needed a shower
Said you fed me, and you clothed me, you packed me a sack lunch
Papa said, "When I get older, get a girl like your momma"
But I'm twenty (cough) years old and runnin' out of options
How I'm supposed to trust ya?
Ain't you one of them ones tryin' to run up
Pose for the perfect picture, upload and post it?
Question: Is you with me or not?
I'm from the city where they wear bikinis in the water drought
But I'm used to having cyclones blown in and out of my life
So it's no biggie if you need time to figure it out

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
(You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'
You know I'm only fuckin' with you
(I bet you I was only thinkin' if I)
If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you
(You know I can't do nothin' with you)
You know I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth
No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
You know you wrong, shit you out of pocket
Remember you was couch surfin', you ain't have a casa
And mi casa, I would buy you shoes from out the locker
Even though I heard around the town from all the gossip
Between they legs and slidin' limousines in garages
Heard your mama cheated on ya daddy, you just like her
Karma come around, remember what happened to Tiger
Game over, dead wrong, Biggie Wallace
I was the one you counted on before you stacked your wallets
Talkin' 'bout me, motherfucker, you the one with problems
Haha, you played yourself for a photo that you ain't know though
I only took from niggas trying to slide up in the DM
And show 'em I was happy with the nigga I was seein'
But you fucked up, stupid, so I guess I'll go and see 'em
As you contemplate how to get me back like Liam
No fuckin' tonight, I'll be gone by the PM

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
With all the kissin', the touchin', the bitin', the tuggin'
You know, you know I love what you do
(You know I know I love what you do)
And all the spittin', the cursin', the fightin' and fussin'
You know I'm only fuckin' with you
(I bet you I was only thinkin' if I)
If I could, I'd take you everywhere
But you know I can't do nothin' with you
(You know I can't do nothin' with you)
You know I never looked as good as I do, and it's the truth
No bullshit, I'm nothin' without you

[Outro: Nai Palm]
Might not get, might not get any better
Might not, might not get, might not get any better
Might not, might not get



[Skit: Anderson .Paak]
(Do you have girlfriends?)
You pickin' on me?
(No, why are you saying that?)
Why are you picking on me?
(Why would I do that? Now let me ask you this question)
Why you pickin' on me?
Shut up and sit down! I told you to sit down!

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Don't use it all at once
Baby girl, your prime is about that long
Don't use it, timing is all we got
Baby girl, your prime is about that long

[Verse: Anderson .Paak]
Oh, hell no
I had to get back for the candy, uh
I flew for an hour then landed, oh
She live on a beautiful campus, oh
She dumb as a brick but she pass all her classes
Know what she want and she know I ain't shit but a savage, ooh
She soaking up game
Her brain is a series of pamphlets, wow
She told me a story as long as her lashes
Oh what a hopeless romantic
Fucking with jokers and addicts
She told me everybody close to her age is full of mad shit
I said, 'Baby girl, you ain't even old enough to be jaded'
And wow, she want visual stimulation
Short attention span and little patience
I like Hennessy and record players
Teddy Pendergrass and Sammy Davis
Opposites attract. I swear, we a magnet
Don't be fucking up your scholarship
I can't help you with grants
Word to my father, my word and my balls is 'bout all that I honor
As God is my witness if you don't jump back in this bed

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Don't use it all at once
Baby girl, your prime is about that long
(Do what you want, what you want, as long as you jump in the bed)
I only want to do what feels right
I have to be gone before the midterms
You making up your mind, you're out of songs aren't you?
I wanted an encore, more tunes

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Hey, come back to bed
Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah
Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah
Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah
Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah
Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah
Come jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah
Come back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah
Come jump in the bed

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Don't use it all at once
Baby girl, your prime is about that long
Timing is all we got
Baby girl, your prime is about that long

[Verse 1]
If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really are

[Chorus]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Verse 2]
You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell

[Pre-Chorus]
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really are

[Chorus]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Break]
No more, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more



[Speech: DJ Khaled & Asahd Tuck Khaled]
My son, Asahd, thank you for executive producing Grateful. I love you. Yes boy, yes boy, yes boy, yes boy, yes boy.



[Chorus: Ashanti]
See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you
See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I won't keep running back to you

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
I think about my strength to finally get up and leave
No more broken heart for me, no more telling your lies to me
I'm looking like I got my head on right, so now I see
No more giving you everything, there's no more taking my love from me

[Chorus: Ashanti]
See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you
See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I won't keep running back to you

[Verse 2: Ashanti]
I'm glad to wake up every day without you on my brain
No more where you're laid up at night, no more having to fuss and fight
I'm proud to say that I will never make the same mistake
No more thinkin' bout what you do, there's no more me runnin' back to you

[Chorus: Ashanti]
See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you
See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I won't keep running back to you

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G. & Ashanti]
Some say the X make the sex
Spec-tacular, make me lick you from your neck
To your back, then you're shivering, tongue delivering
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If it's alright with you, we fucking
That's cool
Déjà vu, the blunts sparked, finger fucking in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between your legs?
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head: straight to your mother's bed
At the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to suites at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Carribean, but tonight, no ends

[Bridge: Ashanti]
You must be used to me crying
While you're out bumping and grinding
But I'm leaving you tonight

[Chorus: Ashanti]
See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you

[Outro: Ashanti & The Notorious B.I.G.]
You must be used to me crying
While you're out bumping and grinding
But I'm leaving you tonight
Uh, and another one

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
My dawgs don't bark, but they get off
Fuck around and get your whole face bit off
Sinister, spit truth like a minister
So until I'm a monster, when it's the right time
Night time, nigga tryna creep
And keep from dyin' in these motherfuckin' streets
Fuck the police, from a black man's point of view
Spray that shit, say that shit
We right in front of you, each and every one of you
I'm not gon' tell y'all niggas what we gonna do
But whatever y'all did, put two on it
And put a foot on your neck with a shoe on it
Resident evil, it's all on camera and they still don't believe you
Clownin' around, don't come your clown ass 'round here
Nigga you gon' get down
Real talk, I'm leavin' all you clown ass niggas outlined in chalk
Stay black, payback from way back
I'm the homie, 'but the motherfuckin' homie don't play that

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
And the night will fall, this is death to you all
When the nighttime falls, this the final call
This the final call, call, call

[Spoken Interlude]
The final call, see reparations will be tooken
For all the shit you mother fuckers done did
Now it ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun, ha
Motherfuckers, trip this

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Cut them motherfuckers off the leash
It's been a week since my dogs ate, let 'em eat
See I'ma tell you upfront and uncut
See I'm a stand up nigga, I'm a man up nigga
Get what I gotta get, a bitch nigga gon' talk a whole lot of shit
Which is the main reason why you stuck around
And I don't fuck around
I'm blowin' new purple in a new circle
I don't wanna hurt you but I will spurt you
And send you back to the earth, you
Came from, game gun
Same one, that I used in another galaxy
Actually, it's all fact to me
If I ruled the world would it come back to me?
Black to me, with my hand on that thang thang
I'm from the home of the brave, land of the gang bang

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
And the night will fall, this is death to you all
When the nighttime falls, this the final call
This the final call, call, call
And the night will fall, this is death to you all
When the nighttime falls, this the final call
This the final call, call, call

We will make it out alive
Leave the waiting world behind us
We will not give up this time

Hold on to our reasons
And plan the escape
Hold on to our reasons
And plan the escape



[Bei Maejor - Verse 1]

Pops call me Brenan Mike, moms call me baby B
Girl call me baby, my fans call me USD
Time call me young, but my bank say I’m grown
Streets call me gone, but my mind say I’m home
Little sister call me Branny, same for my Granny
Special shoutout to all of the women in my family
Haters call me weak, but a genius call me babbling
Rappers call me for beats, Snow Bunnies call me chocolate
Neighbors call the cops on me when I turn my music up
Ex-girlfriend call me say; “sorry for screwing up!”
Rap heads call me Pop, Top 40 call me Street
Older women call me cute, old heads call me G
Diesel call me Mazing, Rocco'll call me Bro
And the homies call me from the crib to say what up doe!
And labels call me next, then they sign my checks
Psychics call success and my Preacher call me blessed!

[Hook - Mike Posner]

They call me whatever they want, who oh!
They call me whatever they like, alright

Is it that I ain't the same man?
Somehow I changed when
I turned the key and walked through that door
They call me whatever they want, yea

[Mike Posner - Verse 2]

My mommy calls me Michael, my homies calls me Pose
I call hoes hoes, but I never call hoes
And if you call me Paz then you dont really like me
Your brother calls me Ill, your sister calls me Mikey
They used to call me lame cuz all I did was make beats
I've been called wack, been called a genius an everything in between
They call me the next J.T but I dont dance tho
I cut a check to Detroit, you bought a Lambo
And I dont call the press, what you call that?
Just to solve the problems in my head, I'll give it back
The Rap-Singer, all of the above
You could call me, Im coming after legacy and love

[Hook - Mike Posner]

They call me whatever they want
They call me whatever they like, alright

Is it that I ain't the same man?
Somehow I changed when
I turned the key and walked through that door
They call me whatever they want

[Bei Maejor - Verse 3]

Cops call me arrogant, tryna to figure out my whip
How that nigga get that shit? He dont even look that rich
Friends call me humble, enemies I don’t know
Got no clue what they were saying
Cause them boys be thangin' yo
Chavs call me B, auntie call me Major
Grandfather call me son, now I see ‘em later, uh!
She ain’t call me B, same for Lea & Drizzy
Can’t call me brother boy, I sit you on your grizzy
Teachers call me super smart, girls call me super cool
The yearbook call me flyest nigga in the school
Critics call me crazy, my Coach call me lazy
Told me run a hundred laps or else he wouldn't play me, what?
Quit the team started making music, now they caught me on
Aunt Winnie had a bad memory she called me Sean
Groupies call me Major babe, Age call me 80's baby
Father called me Rager baby, momma say I’m paper crazy
She probably right, I do be stackin'
And jealous people call me fake, they say I do be actin
But that’s cool, cause promoters call me main attraction
My cousin Hope say you’re slipping yo, you’re losing attraction
Call me what you want, never late for dinner
Call me Jordan call me Gretsky call me Tiger, I’m a winner!
If it's racing, call me Jeff, my uncles call me neph
Cyphers call success, heard the Preachers say I’m blessed, yes!

[Bridge & Hook]

You don’t know, what you have
You gonna find, I’ve been so bad!
You don’t know, what you have
You gonna find, I’ve been so bad!

They call me whatever they want
They call me whatever they like, alright

Is it that I ain't the same man?
Somehow I changed within
I turned the key and walked thru that door
They call me whatever they want



[Verse]
Yeah, look
Straight out the holy land to holdin' grams
Tra-tra-trappin' out stolen vans with goals and plans
Lonely man, remember bein' my only fan
I'm down and up, the Midas touch, the golden hand
Blood in the soil is over oil
Cold-hearted, my blood boils
The spoils of war are used to take the drugs out the foil
Man these arms can't reach you, AR's won't recoil
Goddamn, I might marry a heiress and move to Paris
Fuck the carriage baby, let's go disappear and just perish
Thirty karats in the gold
I wear it to cherish the kings from which we inherit
My chariot is McLaren
It's all numeric
Talkin' numbers, you incoherent
Don't be embarrassed, I blame your parents for even caring
Or not aborting, ah fuck it, it's not important
My vital organs can't even tell if it's night or morning
Final warning, final warning, final warning
Every morning you'll awake and await mourning
We earn it then we burn it to ash
I call it urn money
My dog caught 40 before he turned 20
Money is earned, the rest is inherited
Hashish come from Marrakech, all my kush is American
Man I feel like a therapist, pistol on me like Maravich
I careless, I'm so perilous with all of this arrogance, goddamn
Money, hoes, that's something that you can't chase
I ain't shit but let you eat from the same plate
If you ungrateful then you ain't great
Me and Khaled come from the same place
Huh, holy land, holy land
Back when I was holdin' grams just to haul a Benz
Yeah, holy land, holy land
My father never was a holy man



[Verse]
Hey, I got the world on my shoulder
For real, I got to stay up on my toes, for real
God bless me, glory, please protect me, glory
Oh, they tried to tempt me, but you never neglect me
I got my hands to the sky screaming glory
Glory, glory Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I prayed that they don't do you
I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray glory!
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah



[Intro: Lloyd]
Aw yeah
Drop it for a nigga
That ass up

[Hook: Lloyd]
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Pipe it up and drop it for me, one mo' time
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last year
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, I do love you

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
She say I only love the way she drop it, well maybe so
She say I'll probably leave if she don't pop it, we'll never know
Cause she get down on us, scrub the ground on it, with no shame
Give her time on it, roll around on it, do her thang
I ain't, the type to trick but she go hard for the cause
Type to bust it open wide and have me close down the mall
We ain't, gotta take it slow, she's-a hit the door
Let it show, for the give and go, get it on the flo'
Woo, ayy, shake it like you never ever got to shake it
If pussy popping was a college, she done graduated
She need a bow for that ass just to celebrate it
A lot of clapping and a standing ovation when she

[Hook: Lloyd]
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Pipe it up and drop it for me, one mo' time
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last year
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, I do love you

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
I be in the streets with my woes
And I be on the creep all the time with these hoes
Can't help that I'm a freak and it shows
See I be eating pussy, kissing titties, sucking toes
Million dollar nigga since a youngin
And if the police coming then I'm runnin'
And if I go to jail then my baby post the bail
Nigga, nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothing
She got some ugly ass ways
Aw, but she sure look fine
She know how to blow my mind
When she drop that ass for me like it's 1999

[Hook: Lloyd]
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Pipe it up and drop it for me, one mo' time
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last year
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, I do love you

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]
You know I love you shorty, or maybe I'm just kidding
But the way you pop that, pop that pussy, shit I'm all up in it, tightly fitted
Bounce that ass up, got to climb up the pole
If she ever hit the stage, I'ma be at her show
Cause she my favorite life, favorite type
That bust it open, bust it baby, but she lady like
Ooh, I'm talking head wraps and sundresses, heels for her flexing
Ain't no time she won't lend me that box, it need stretching
On the late night
She got the kind of glove to catch me if the play's right
That fly you out, you and that ass have a safe flight
And I'ma be there when she lands
Cause she never stood a chance in that bow-legged stance
Told her back that ass up

[Hook: Lloyd]
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Pipe it up and drop it for me, one mo' time
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last year
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, I do love you



[Pre-hook]
Now usually I talk about that Cadillac on vogues
But today it's all about Monte Carlo, propped up on lows
I set it out, I set it out, I set it out for sure
I keep it cooler than a polar bear's toes
You better hop in before I close that door

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
They're like
There he go again talking 'bout that candy paint
Slabbin' out, working wheel in the daytime
Don't settle for the trap, hi-hats and the clap
Bih', what you know about that bassline
Big booming, slip the lever
Haters grip for the backseat of the car like a fallen star
All these screens of light, I can charge at night
Ladies drink for free when they' at the bar
Pull up, barely stood up
High fiving every old school player tippin' in the lot
With a couple pretty things on they' shoulders
Then they told her "Krizzle gotta give 'em what you got"
So I kill 'em with the low
Joe Lewis knocking down doors
Grippin that wheel
They like "What happened to the lac?"
I told 'em 'bout this muscle

Dynamic, panoramic
I ain't seen the roof since you seen mine
Forgiato, paint melado
When you seen me, shawty you seen shine
Glass house, I put the ass out
When I roll supreme, I call it creepin' clean
I hit the gas on the low when I'm on the scene
Ya I be waking up them neighbors with the 15's when I vroom
Candy paint on the fleet
6 deep with the slab, ballin' in these street
Pull up on the curb - what the fuck, what you heard?
I swang and I swerve, I'm swangin' for keeps
That's that old school flow
Sugar Ray knocking down doors
Grippin' that wheel
They like "What happened to the lac?"
I told 'em 'bout this muscle

[Hook:]
I think angels get high
Cause I can't describe all these clouds in the sky
I think God must have cried
Cause I can't describe all this rain in my life
I think angels get high

[Verse 1:]
When the sun goes down, heroes don't come outside
I seen too many villains provide
How can I choose a side to be on?
Tell a junkie be gone
Cause I don't push what he on or she on
Like before
Sometimes it's hard to pay the debt that you owe
Too much of something good will have you strung on the floor
Thunderstorms forever form outside my home
I swear these angels taking bong hits
I wonder if that flood that came through just because that left us on the curb was one of God's tears
To wash away the pain that we had
The house wasn't much, the neighborhood was bad
The basement won't save us but the prayers get us past
The rumbling and the thundering never last
So I ask, so I ask, so I ask

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Standing on the roof while helicopters swoop by
I think they don't see us
Not even FEMA could redeem the very faith we all lost
That made us once believers
Natural disasters bring us closer
My partner never prayed until he thought the world was over
2012, December 1st, he called me in a panic
He heard a storm was coming and it might destroy the planet, dammit
I called him back tomorrow because the boat I been paddling can't deal with so much sorrow
Borrowed time wasted
I probably shoulda played it safe instead of storm chasing
But the prayers will get us past
The rumbling and the thundering never last
So I ask, so I ask, so I ask

[Hook:]



[Intro]
Yeah, just pass the aux cord man
Yeah, just pass the aux cord
Heh, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
I'm just tryna play that fly shit, Sly Family Stone ride shit
Even if you don't smoke, get high shit
Laid back like this that, this that, this that vibe
Finally got off work like this that, this that ride
To vacation, across 110th Street was blazing
For the motherless children that related to Mahalia
I know, you tired of that you can't feel it in your heart
Let the music be your secret lover like Atlantic Starr
New Birth, Wildflower was that jamming shit by far
And Eddie Kendricks' voice will have you singing in your car
I know, I know, I know Marvin played at your home
But that's the reason why your parents had to get it on
That's the reason why you're probably here anyway
Don't fret, you can play that bullshit any day
But, I'm just saying it's a whole catalog
Of analog, the warmer sounds you've ever saw
Pass the aux chord

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Instant Vintage, might as well, that Raphael Saadiq, yeah
Voodoo moved your soul, Cruisin' was made for L-U-V-ing
Badu food for thought, eat out her Appletree and
Jill Scott forever golden, R.I.P. B.B. King
Prince and MJ that we played, barbecue to death
Summer shine, summertime, Will Smith and Jazzy Jeff
Willie Hutch scored the mack while Foxy Brown was slept
Billy Paul, Me and Ms. Jones, I always knew she crept
Barry White, Love Unlimited for the Soul Brothers
Ohio players and heat wave for the Cole Brothers
Funkadelic, Minnie Riper through the speakers
Bill Withers, Johnnie Taylor, cheaper just to keep her
David Ruffin and The Temptations
Christmas time, Silent Night, Gladys Midnight Train kept the Pips waitin'
I'm saying, we can go and chill on that other shit
And join the Parliament, mothership
With this aux chord

[Outro: Nikki Greer]
Music on another level
Let this eargasm take you to Heaven
And get you high
Waking me up
You're taking me higher, ohh
You're waking me up
You're taking me higher, ohh
Keep waking me up



[Hook]
I can't believe I took it this far, this time
I told myself, I should be smart and not blind
Bang, bang, bang, down we went today
Lord, I think there's something wrong
Bang, bang, bang, another bullet went astray
Another soul dead and gone

[Verse 1]
I heard a gun the other day
It spoke to me and told me power
Was the only thing that we could lose
So don't be afraid to let it shower
On them, if they ever run up at my door
It came with a red dot, for sure shot, and a silencer on the low
I had to stop and pause and think about it
While it gave me its resume
Told me no better way to protect myself
In this world we live in
Cause they killing up women and children
Ain't nothing like having one on hand
Cause if you draw down first you'll be the man
Then you'll pop your trunk and demand
That respect, if they neglect, in the club
When they touched my queen they didn't know what we had was love
And it'll never be the same cause you'll throw it in my face just because
So I'll pop my trunk once again
For her heart I'll defend
And I'll let it rain on them, The Banana clip theory

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I heard he just killed a man, I think he was a father, I know he was a brother
Because his sis said that, they gon' retaliate tomorrow
The doors still revolvin; gun shop
You looking for the kinda clip that don't stop
Cause you heard the jack boys coming for the very spot
That you opened up on they block
They wore red but you bang blue, they drove by but they ain't shoot
Till you was outside with the whole fam, havin' brews, talkin shit, eatin' barbeque
Duck and dodge, but it ain't safe, you hit the corner but they gave chase
And double back cause you got away
But your little cousin got hit
Sleepin in his baby crib
No CPR cause it's too late
So you cry, but you bounce back
Your reply is to get the gat
It's an eye for an eye till it's jet black
The only way you'll survive in your mind is to stay strapped
So you act out
They'll call you soft if you back out
So you roll your window down and you black out
They next day they'll be back 'round
The Banana Clip Theory

[Hook]



[Hook]
All I need is God, couple mil' and a porterhouse
All these niggas' paper soldiers cardboard, cut 'em out
I remember when I ain't had shit
Mama said don't touch nothing, now I'm on some grab shit
Murder everything on some stab shit
Bystanders, getting head and power up
Motherfucking highlander
Been a while, since I let these niggas ramble
All I hear is Mt. Olympus banging out the band door

[Verse]
You ain't said shit 'til you said it to me
You payin' for the pussy shawty said it was free
Now I ain't got time for the fake ones
All I talk about cake motherfucker go and bake one
We was on some shit back in nine-nine
You was suckin' on ya' mama's titties hollering bout the toy mine
Bottom line, I was on the grind all around town
Country bumpkin southern motherfucker in surround sound, Yes!
I flexed and I paid dues
Kicked a couple doors that they said I couldn't break through
I remember starving on the real, nigga
Now I got steak on the grill, nigga
Saute shrimp, lemon peel let it chill, nigga
Nah, you can't eat cause it's keep what you kill, nigga
Rolling down the strip like I never made it
Peepin' all the broke motherfuckers keep me motivated
Pop that ass for a player, don't be scared of the dick
Find a drink and some gators for a pimp
I ain't playin' with these hoes
Bad bitches super fly, super (?) with these hoes like a pimp



[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
I got big bank flexing on a mothafucka
Ain't shit changed cause I'm still getting, still mine
Ain't no love for a hater tryna fly me, tryna play me
Mothafuckas never stop my, stop shine
Yeah they see me but they still watching
I got shining on re-run (on re-run) I got shining on re-run
Yeah they see me but they still watching
I got shining on re-run (on re-run) I got shining on re-run

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
I was one deep, creepin'
Caddy on high, my paint never dry
Forgiato, the women, and tires squeaking
Where niggas will never get by
Flipping the script on the hoes
Shine up the grill in these glows
Paper dip but never show
'Til the fucking lot was super throwed
Players out'chea on game
Pimpin' so cold on the hoes on the two below
That we can put out the flame
Of the blue hand of the roof of the coupe
All I got is bands man, who got the change?
Who got the number to the nearest burger diner?
The club can chirp 'fore the clip hit the pole
And do a split, cause we bought wings
We ain't talking about flights
Talking lemon pepper vodka with the ice
Spent more on Js than the steak and the shrimp
Than mo' gon' make in they in life
Ain't tripped up, never hiccup from the drank
Pick up where I left off on the dank
Flexed out, never stressed out over chains
Stretched out, get pressed out on the grain
Woof! You hear that there
I make it where these mothafuckas feel that there
When the rims too big and the road ain't shit
It make it hard to steer that there
But it's big bank, big bank, big bank, big bank, one time
I wake up, cake up, cake up, then press, rewind

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
I got big bank flexing on a mothafucka
Ain't shit changed cause I'm still getting, still mine
Ain't no love for a hater tryna fly me, tryna play me
Mothafuckas never stop my, stop shine
Yeah they see me but they still watching
I got shining on re-run (on re-run) I got shining on re-run
Yeah they see me but they still watching
I got shining on re-run (on re-run) I got shining on re-run
Big bank

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Big bank, currency, and revenue
Getting to it, all a nigga ever do
And all I care about is how to get it, no doubt
Big numbers in front of my decimal, check it
Make sure it's multiplying
Is all I'm ever I worried about
And slow money beat no money
What the fuck you in a hurry 'bout?
Nigga, I'm saying, mm
Stay getting to it that broke shit ain't in my plan, yeah
Sleep when I'm dead, I'ma grind every day that I can
Got seven kids, and I gotta make sure
All of 'em them fed, by any means
Can't be no excuses, my children can't eat no excuses
My daughter can't sleep in excuses
My son he see me with no paper like keep your excuses
If you ain't producing, you're useless
That's why I'm out here getting to it
Fresh out the booth, I go straight to the stage
Then I go straight to get paid
Hunnid' I earned, fifty I saved
My bitch don't be cleaning up, I need a maid
She don't be cooking so I need a chef
Ain't giving me nothin', I get it myself
I'm doing my thing and I did it to death
Stacking them chips, getting that dough
Millions, need me a couple hundo
Big mansion with a double front do'
Pretty young thang in a new condo
Pray to God I could stay rich and stay humble

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
I got big bank flexing on a mothafucka
Ain't shit changed cause I'm still getting, still mine
Ain't no love for a hater tryna fly me, tryna play me
Mothafuckas never stop my, stop shine
Yeah they see me but they still watching
I got shining on re-run (on re-run) I got shining on re-run
Yeah they see me but they still watching
I got shining on re-run (on re-run) I got shining on re-run
Big bank

[Outro: Mannie Fresh]
Earthlings and aliens, gather around, come close
While I tell you the story of fine ass Denise
And the 4 15s in a Caprice
Hitting hard like a disrespectful step-daddy
The thunder god coming up the block
Going subbing is a way of life
Hugged up with yo' baby mama or your wife
Ride on, sub on



[Verse 1]
Yeah, my creator gave me the gift to create
And this mind of mine apply to our escape
In an atmosphere that wouldn't hold our weight
If I leave from here, I'll call when I'm safe
Knocking on the door, hoping someone answers
Yeah, I call that faith
This mouth of mine has turned down water for wine
I still recall that taste of bittersweet
Like when I realize you'll never be as perfect as the one that invented me
And the world full of temptations can make you feel so incomplete
Grow up to better than me, go farther than I can go
See farther than I can see
When my days draw to a close, breathe longer than I can breathe
And I'm fine with that
In the event that I decide to move forward what you've done
They can rewind it back
And I'm a proud parent now as I was a proud parent then
I saw you grow up to become the kind of king that I knew you'd always been
Indeed, there's a finish line for me, but for you, there's no end
So, perhaps all that work that's been done was a win
And although my intentions were for good, it still brung us to a sin
But I'll pay for your mistakes as long as this world continues to spin
As this vessel of mine breaks down, I know you have never been
I'm sure as Multi is your home, hard times will come again
I set aside a book of rhymes that'll pave the way for now and then
I know forever is a mighty long time—so where should we begin?

[Verse 2]
—On the Southside 'cause I'm a country bumpkin, bumpin' out the system, fuck if they don't listen
We done came a long way from niggas throwing CDs out the window like I made a frisbee
Better than veteran rapper's favorite rappers
Conscious or trappers and I'm Mississippi
Dirty Southern mothafucka kicking
Like a red bucket with white top chitlins
Shittin' on niggas, my rhyme flow
Hands-'hind-back, eyes blind fold
Mind, body, and soul connected to the Most High
Even when times got low
Uhh, look how they hate me, but copy me
Possibly I was the one with components and properties
To be the greatest of all time, but you won geography lottery
So I keep kicking, flipping tables, chosen and favored
Fuck being major when giant is greater
Fortune and fame but you fuck for the label
Truth is what made me
Settle down, settle down, I was angry but I'm better now
Niggas talking raising bars, mine amongst the stars
Give it time to level out
If you worried about the flow, I'll make a beat
Write you a hook that you repeat
Even go as far to drop a mixtape that you re-do
Never credit me, separately sold
Slick as the Giuseppe on slippery floors
Mop by the buckets that I used to hold
While dreaming of plaques and selling out shows
Multi-alumni forever the fours



[Intro]
I'll paint all the world for you baby
I'll paint all the world for you
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I'll paint all the world for you baby
(I'll paint all the world for you)

[Hook]
Yeah
I wish you saw the bigger picture
I wish you saw the bigger picture
If I make it I'll come back to get you
Clear as day but you don't see the vision
I wish you saw the bigger picture
What we got deserves some patience
Cause this ain't no finger painting
I wish you saw the bigger picture
Beautiful and modern all the same
But what's a photo if it's out of frame
I wish you saw the bigger picture
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I pray you see the bigger picture

[Verse 1]
I call your phone
You don't pick up, you text me
Too late to come back you say my art ain't even half the way it used to look
The colors that I chose to compose my last masterpiece wasn't worth the cover of a book
I listen as you rant on 'bout Rembrandts and Van Goghs
That, I used to show you was so pure at heart
Now all the pictures that I draw lately perfect my need to be basic and all the shading tears your world apart
Pollock I promise you say it's scribble and scratch
I know you don't mean it cause on your wall's where it sat
It's not my best I agree but I did what I could
With these sticks and these stones to get us out of the woods
I find my rhythm and and my stroke then you fall in love with my art like you did before
On that note I let go and tend to my canvas to paint a mural of us
I hope that you understand the bigger picture

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Back to my roots
Channel my youth
You love the color of yellow but I'm working with blue
Like what's the use of doing art if I ain't breaking the rules
My graffiti wasn't Banksy but you thought it was cool
It used to be fun to watch me do what it do
But when the paint started drying I stopped running to you
I started walking away cause I could paint any day
One line from being complete
I'm sorry I made you wait to get a crown and some space
I thought you'd be a great painter
Cause you could see the good in me in all the angles
A radiant child we could've had
And those clowns in your past you paint, just make you laugh
All because, that self portrait that I put on display should've been of us
I left you out and I was wrong
I promise I'll start over if you come back home

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
I'll paint the sky blue
I'll paint the grass green
I'll paint the roses red
And everything in between

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was a gold chain with that gold ring
Twinkle twinkle 'cause they gold, man
Candy paint with the gold flakes
"Stay gold," said Granny as she smiled with her gold teeth
I got a goal to be golden like King Tut
Often those pictures of that gold, they would flicker
Make it hard to call me nigga
'Cause the chains ain't the chains they chained us up with
This rope ain't the rope they hanged us up with
24K gold face with the rollie
Invisible set with the grill, that's how gold taste
Jordan 7s, golden moment with the gold lace
Gold time, gold mines with the gold gates
If I die, bury mine in a gold case
Slow down, never mind it's a gold chase
Goin' for the gusto in a gold place
May God forgive my sins for a gold space
Krizzle

[Hook]
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case the old man doesn't know me and claims that I owe
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case I'm forsaken and I have to pay for my soul

[Verse 2]
I had a partna that went gold on the track and field
But the gold never shined in our atmosphere
Gold bottles, I ain't talking about the champagne
Malt liquor, sippin' gold helped us maintain
Hood niggas watching Goldie like that's us
Baggin' up the gold dust with the laws rushed
Snitchin' on them golden boys with the gold trust
Represented by the lawyers with gold cuffs
They order sweet potato with the gold crust
At the same restaurant with the gold judge
That hate the confidence and shine that the gold gives
So we take away your freedom and your golden years
The only time you see your mother's golden tears
Like, what good is gold if you never here?
What good is gold that you never wear?
I hope it pays your way on a golden pier

[Hook]
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case the old man doesn't know me and claims that I owe
And he claims that I owe, Lord, Lord, bury me in
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case I'm forsaken and I have to pay for my soul

[Outro]
And this song isn't meant to be a glorification of gold
But the understandin' that even if I could take all of this with me
That I’d give it away to get to heaven
I’d give it away to see my grandmother again
I’d give it away to be at paradise and be at peace with myself
Big houses, nice cars, all that stuff cool
But it's materialistic things that we strive so hard for
As human beings, and it's not fulfillin'
It doesn’t take away the pain, it doesn’t take away the loss
You have to search higher, you have to go higher for that
The higher power, that higher energy
And that’s what I’m striving for
So in the event that I go and you have to bury me
You can bury me with all these things
And as soon as I see my Maker, I would give it all back
I’d give it all away because it wasn’t nowhere near as important
As being in Heaven and bein' at peace
Believe that there, believe that there, hah
Bury me in gold, hahaha
That's the rapper in me just wantin' to do the hook one more time
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Peace to everybody, man, stay blessed
God bless, we love y'all

[Intro]
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Uh
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Uh
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Uh
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac

[Verse 1]
Uh, what you think a real nigga rap for?
So I can roll around in a RAV4? Never that
Cadillac pimped out, fish bowl, true vogues
Fifteens, but I had to go and get two mo'
Whassup, get buck, shake junt killa
DJ booth with the pole in the middle
For the edge of the rest to go flash up a bitch
See how far these vegetables get us
Pour up, the show up, the focus
The doors ain't typical when they get open, hol' up
You ain't never been sky high
Swear I coulda died when I hopped out my ride
Like four or five times, no parachute
Bungee jump for the loot
Hock a loogie out the roof, what I feel like
Porn on the screen, two hoes on the scene tongue kissin'
You would think my whip dyke
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—too early for the hook
Not sure if it's the sawed-off pump or the bass in the trunk that keep a nigga shook
Careful no crook, tell a bitch, “Look.”
How I work the wheel and the crisis
Police behind us my index was grindin' her pussy like rhyme with no timin'
I think I'm nicest of all (All, all, all, all)
That's the way I feel, bitch! Crawl (Crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl)
Why you showing your grill, bitch? We off (Off, off, off, off)
Our way outta here, don't get lost
I come in peace from somewhere unique
Have no fear, uh

[Hook]
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Fuck yo' whip, nigga!
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
I took yo' bitch, nigga!
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Fuck yo' whip, nigga!
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
I took yo' bitch, nigga!

[Verse 2]
Uh, what you think a real nigga rap for?
So I can roll around with a nympho? Yessir
Twenty five lighters on my dresser, the best of
Versace, Versace, Versace, my bezel
The bass and the treble will beat, ho
Komodo with the four-door when creepin', slow
I pull up on the high side, God give me high five
Every time I holla, " I thank you, Lawd"
Jesus please, don't let the jackers try to take what's mine
Hate to have to black out, reach in the dash to the Lac, ‘fo the Act Right
Cause a nigga act like I'ma just back down
And I'ma put some vogues on these toes bitch
I blew the back out the trunk with the fifth wheel slump
It's some neon that's red, that's my old shit
But this some cold shit
That my granddaddy wish he could have drove in, then passed down
So in honor of Zebby, I bring a ho down like a levee
When I slab 'round in this glass house
See me in it, it was easy pimpin', 'fore you even finish trick or treating trippin', she wasn't even with it, she was outside the Lac tryna ease in it
She might fall (fall, fall, fall, fall)
It ain't really that high, bitch crawl (crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl)
Why you showing your grill, bitch? We off (off, off, off, off, off)
Our way outta here, don't get lost
I come in peace from somewhere unique
Have no fear, uh!

[Hook]
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Fuck yo' whip, nigga!
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
I took yo' bitch, nigga!
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
Fuck yo' whip, nigga!
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac
Cadillac-lac-lac-lac, Cadillac-lac-lac-lac—lac
I took yo' bitch, nigga!

[Outro]
Slabbin’ ‘round, my windows down, you hear the sound
That sonic boom, that ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bass
That shake your baby momma crib
Pardon me if I phone home 4000 miles away from where you at
If you ain't holdin' back I can take your whip
C-A-D-I-Double-L-A-C-T-I-C-A
C-A-D-I-Double-L-A-C-T-I-C-A
C-A-D-I-Double-L-A-C-T-I-C-A
C-A-D-I-Double-L-A-C-T-I-C-A, K-R-I-T forever

[Skit: Big K.R.I.T. & crew + employee]
Hold up, nigga
Nigga, hit that new spot real quick called Mo' Grease than Beef nigga, see what they hittin' on round this bitch
I heard they got some fried biscuits too, though
Yeah, they be giving them hoes away though, I don’t want no given-away biscuit

Yeah, man, what happenin', welcome to Mo Grease than Beef, what can I get for you, man?

I want a #1, my nigga, but, uh… I don’t see what it is on the menu man, run that shit down for a player real quick

Oh, you want the #1? Shit, well, the #1 come with two sides—shit, you can get some poverty or some famine. And bruh, if you don’t want that famine, nahmsayin, you can always get some low self esteem—or a biscuit

Mmm, nah, I’m good on that, my nigg’, I’m good though…

Say, bruh, I know you wanna take some food home to your baby mamma. You can go and get her the Plan B meal—it come with a free DNA test, two bitchass niggas. Shit, or you can get a biscuit. Best part of all this, it’s already prepared for you, bruh. This shit been sittin’ here all day. Waitin’ on you

Hell nah!



[Hook: Big KRIT & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Mic check, one check, one two, anybody out there listenin'
To my pains and my disposition, I'm on that impossible mission
Tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Before the government come and crush it
Ain't enough weed and Codeine you can pour me
To keep me buzzin'
Shawty burnin' palo santo to clear the air
Lay some Krizzle out even if my energy ain't really there
I'm thankful that you shared
I'm more concerned with a big house and a nice car
But she don't care
But I'm an alpha male so I grind
The 40 acres and mule, I want mine
Ain't nothin' free in life they woulda told me
As a new born I could barely walk
Tryna chase a dollar on Easter Sunday
Then they popped my collar like be a player
Don't fall victim to bein' broke
Them white folk want you down and poor
So get money, that's all I know

[Hook: Big KRIT & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Nowadays bottles get popped
Ain't been to the doctor for a physical in a minute
I'm sure my liver probably shot
Ain't no sleepin' if you on
Tryna keep up with the Joneses
Yeah, it's lonely at the top but the view is beautiful
In the morning to tell the truth I miss my family
Ain't spoke to my mom in weeks
I promised her I buy her a new house
The next time that we speak
So I'ma hit the road like a flat tire
Run these brakes 'till they squeak
And I'ma pimp what I can from Def Jam
Cause I know my worth ain't cheap
Ya'll can't sell me no dream
I done been down and out, growing
If happiness is the tour bus that's a far aways from homeless
That's a far away from where they want me
Shuckin', jivin', for a piece of change
These niggas do whatever for the shine
But I can't be the same

[Hook: Big KRIT & BJ The Chicago Kid]
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here

[Outro: BJ The Chicago Kid]

[Chorus]
Your confetti ain't even heavy, nigga
Got the win, I want the record, nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy

[Verse 1]
These niggas fuckin' up the game, this shit is so suspicious
You ain't buy it all unless you blew a ticket
All off in the VIP, but you ain't fuck them bitches
I'mma ball all summer just to flex for Christmas
Angel wings on the doors, I gotta suplex 'em
Money don't make you fly, that's just my perspective
Runnin' up the score to expose a bluff
'Cause nowadays gettin' a win just ain't enough
Fuck the check up last week, I got a new agenda
The last time I couldn't buy some shit, I can't remember
The last time I fucked the world, I might've bust the center
I bought a crib and set that bitch on top of Mount' Olympus
When you livin' that high up, it's hard to see the tension
I'm only sellin' game, I'm all out of simpin'
Grip the foreign like a trophy, gotta hold it steady
Fuck your party when your confetti ain't even heavy, nigga

[Chorus]
Got the win, I want the record, nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy

[Verse 2]
We all off in the club like Sincere on Belly
Can't even drink my liquor, money on my celly
Accountant like, "You got a check, spend it when you ready"
I'm giving niggas hell, pray I go to Heaven
Nailin' in they coffin, the cost of them being off it
Ballin' since Iverson crossed you, winner's circle my office
Fuckin' off with these wins, you fuckin' up with this loss
Waiter forgot my season, I'm glad that they throwin' that salt
Might just throw a toss and holla, "Fuck it!"
'Cause when your wrist game know the grip changed, niggas' buckets
Chip rain in the strip game, hoes will bust it
Snakes come, chop they heads off, cobra clutchin'
On a meal ticket, motherfuck you if you feel different
I caught a break, no debate, and you still fishin'
The genie out the bottle and you still wishin'
Know my downfall 'cause you petty, confetti ain't even heavy, nigga

[Chorus]
Got the win, I want the record, nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy



[Intro]
We make it cool to be southern

[Verse 1]
Okay I'm straight up off my grandmama porch
Hollywood neva, I took the southernized approach
Collard green pockets but I southern fried the flow
Candied yam drop with some cornbread to throw
Mason jar drank shit, keep the dank lit
We swang whips old schools like my paw-paw
You can't get
Now which motherfuckers said that we can't pimp?
I hit ditches like switches, before the paint flip
I can't be faded
The heart of king born in the 1980's
For real, you never see a nigga like me lately
Debonair, never scared, Fred Astaire when I carry a cadence
Refrain for being lame, ho
I got a surefire way to give the game what it came for
A third coast nigga still bustin, stop frontin' motherfucker

[Hook]
We make it cool to be southern
I'm talking about the dirty south, folks with the grills in mouth
We make it cool to be southern
Everybody wanna ball nowadays, but don't nobody wanna get paid
We make it cool to be southern
Get down if you wanna, crackin' seals, blowin' some mari-j-uana
We make it cool to be southern
Return of 4eva all day, them country people feel what I say
We make it cool to be southern

[Verse 2]
Let me take you down this country road
Country flow, country foe, country fire
24's on the Caddy, type savvy
My player ways never fade, I got 'em from my grand daddy
Old school, so smooth
The type of fresh that you can comb through
Or you can cut it with a butter knife
And spread it on the brain of a dame for some change
But that's only if you cut it right
Off top my drop, rims chop, no cops, drink pop
Lord knows I ain't seen it with my
Green lit, grain grip, bad bitch on my tip
And when she tell me, lord knows she don't mean it
I been this way since I was knee high
To a grasshopper gettin' money in my Levis
I mean my genes, Pine-Sol clean
Bird's eye view with my frame on lean

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Get down, get down, get down with it
I'm talking about the dirty south, folks with the grills in mouth
I make it cool to be southern
Return to 4eva all day, them country people feel what I say

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
I hit them with the sub, watch them buckle under pressure
Too many hoes hate cause I got gold on my dresser
Too many nigga watching, praying I might fall quick
Same nigga was in my face last year and that's some flaw shit
Lords knows I've been dying, so this year I can't give up
Creeping like caterpillar, shoes and belts made of lizard
Tweeters, speakers, and kickers
Flow colder than blizzard
Shine brighter than nova, so mother fuck your flicker
I play to the grizzle, that's the bone for you city folk
Give it all I got, pushing chrome with a city ho
Putting on my friends and my kin, hollerin' Multi!
Rep it til the end we gonna win til the sun die
Tell them haters that, now tell them haters this
Instead of jocking mine, go get your own shit
I battle through the buzzard and the cluckers on that fuck shit
Now I'm riding clean and my team ain't nothing to fuck with
A player told me...

[Sample]

[Verse 2]
Now I ain't no chump, I'm known for flowing proper
She bopped off my top you blocked and tried to stop her
Yall flex don't even fakes with chrome and candy paint
You thought that shit could float on it's own but that shit sank
Mister sucka ducket, If you lucky she'll let you finger fuck it
You cuff or buss it, I stretch that pussy like Kangol buckets
Your game too rusty, my game was polished to play a primp
Not even them gators or suits to tailor could save a simp
From a flame spitter, lame nigga
Never had a chance
Break his bitch and the bitch that came with her
And ride off like a thief in the night
Ain't no sense in doing shit if you ain't dying to do it right
What's the word ho?! I got it jumping like a six four
Truck shaking like a nympho
I had to be a king in my past life
Cause I got a crown and my mothafuckin' cash right
A player told me...

[Sample]



[Big Krit]
At the end of the day it's a blessing and I'm still here, I'm still creative and I still can come up with content, subject matter that people really can't touch on nowadays. And at the same time to know that I built my foundation from the ground up. That it wasn't overnight, that it wasn't a gang of vouchers, it wasn't a lot of money that went into marketing me, no. You know what I'm saying, it was music, it was people that had ear to the street, it was people that wanted to spread the word about what I was rapping about, about the content. And at the end of the day, I was always gonna keep it one hundred and I did that with Live At The Underground. Cadillactica, I had to create a planet in order to really help people understand what I'm trying to to do as far as my music is concerned, and that's not be part of a box, not be put in a box, not be put in a genre, but create music that stands on its own, that's what was always about for me



[Hook: Mara Hruby and (Big K.R.I.T.)]
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
(Said my car as I worked her wheel)
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
(Said my car as I worked her wheel)

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
On the boulevard, oh my Lord
Her heels so high, she skipped the curb and ran in your yard
She's so, super fly
Crushed linen inside
This shit way too old, for me to drive
But I really don't care at all
She let me white her walls, and uh, pop her trunk
Turn her out, give her thump
Cause she need it
And she want it
There's no denying how I feel
Cause this love feels so real

[Hook: Mara Hruby]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Oh the boulevard, she go hard
No matter where and when, if I push her buttons she start
So, out of sight
Shawty cold as ice
Ain't no shame in her game, you just ain't her type
That ain't no lie at all
She creep and crawl
And without a stall or a pause, I break her off
Cause she need it and she want it
Theres no denying how I feel
Cause this love feels so real

[Hook: Mara Hruby]

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Never ever have I ever seen a girl like you before
I love to hug onto your curves don't ever let me go
Hold on tight, I'll run the light, the peddle to the floor
And take us higher than we've ever been
(A place where no one goes)
Lets go
(A place where no one knows)
Lets go

[Hook: Mara Hruby]



[Intro]
See, they wonder why we ride high
Why we get high
Shit, it's just to get by
See, some days, sometimes, the world lets you down
And you can't do nothing but fall
This is for y'all

[Hook]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down (uh-uh-uh-uh-oh)
Don't let me down

[Verse 1]
See, we be going through some things
Police hit the block and make it hard for us to hang
My girl bitch 'cuz all I ever do is swang and bang
Pourin' up I swear my liver never be the same
A pint of Hen'll get me in, help to ease the pain
World fucked up and I can't seem to leave the game
So I continue bending corners, bitches switching lanes
Ain't trippin' on the sun, sometimes I'd rather feel the rain
Get high to maintain, don't let me down

[Hook]

I made some plays that I regret, but that's just how it be
I lost some friends, fucked up some money, but stayed on my feet
I did all I could in my city so I had to bounce
I signed my deal and got more haters than I care to count
But I can't fault them for their feelings 'cuz I know the score
It's hard to celebrate for others when you're dying poor
So I keep rolling low-key, DOLO, trying not to stunt
I crank my system 'til it's clipping then I let it thump
Put all my problems in my cup while I grip the wheel
There's too much money to be had, I ain't sitting still
A country boy trying to make these petty ends meet
I learned my lesson, can't trust these niggas 'cuz they envy
Can't stop no show, I'm about this dough, and that's all I can say
Thank god for everything, I coulda died like yesterday
Make room for me in case my plane just ain't meant to fly
I hope you there if I fall from the sky, hollin' out don’t let me down

[Hook]



[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Welcome to the drinkers' club (x3)
(Roll it down, roll it round, pour it up, where yo' cup?)
Welcome to the drinkers' club (x3)
(Roll it down, roll it round, pour it up, where yo' cup?)

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Brown bottles in my system, hoes all at my door
Heard it was going down, and they just wanna go
Dirty all in my grill, Three 6 got this bitch rockin'
Swear I was still in college, look like a hotel lobby
Ho, get on the floor, throwed as fuck and it shows
On another level, let the smoke settle, ho
We runnin' out so get mo'
I got a empty cup, I might fill it up wit' yo' bitch pussy if she go
I ain't even trippin' if the room spinnin' long as I could ride it out slow
Twerk team for me, pro, camera phone is yo' lights
Take this here to yo' dome, you don't need no ice
Eyes red and they tight, two in the morn', we just started
Hangin' onto my chandelier screamin' she just wanna party, bih!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Homie, where's yo' cup? Purple in my slush
Keep sippin', no quittin', ain't no such thing as too much
Juicy ain't no lame, I got yo' dame in my truck
And shawty ain't got no shame in her game, she a slut
I'm in yo' city for one night only
Same old shit, she wanna ride like a pony
Come here, pretty bitch, rock my mic
You just might get you a signing bonus
Diamond studded, the fine hoes love it
Look yo' chick in the eye, she blushin'
Pull yo' chick to the side, we fuckin'
Walk yo' chick outside, she suckin'
And she gon' blame it on the molly
You could take her back, she sorry
The way I killed that pussy, I swear my dick be catchin' bodies
I turn her face to a target, she blow me like a cartridge
I got game like an old Atari - poof - I'm gone in my Ferrari

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rittz]
Shit, I'm drunk in love or gettin' drunk or buzzed
So wanna come get drunk wit' us?
It's like my heart [?]
Take a Xannie bar and crush it up
And twist the cap on a Jack in a jug and chug
I'm drinkin' straight a bottle, fuck a shot glass
Bumpin' OutKast, bout a half or too many, gotta fall back
That Bulleit Bourbon got me feelin' bulletproof
Wakin' up in [?] like "Where the hell is the dog at?"
So fuck Tylenol, I take another shot of Fireball
And bounce back in no time at all
The same night, I'm met my homies wit' some bitches
Gettin' drunk and it's too late for me to drive 'em home
I got that B plan but I usually got the slow cruise on
But tonight I got these hoes threwed on
My homeboy's futon, I'm bout to fuck somethin'
Where ya cup, woman? Drink, ho, I know you wan'
Up in this drinkers' club

[Verse 4: A$AP Ferg]
Welcome to the drinkers' club, I'm sippin'
Lookin' for some cootie cat to slip in
Magic City, booty clappin', strippin'
In the club, I'm slippin' off this Henny
I see potential in that cutie right there
Just imagine Paula Patton, fatter ass and
Baby oil on her back and
Drippin' down that thong and crack and all her man
Wonder in the world can she do on the gas
And tell ya this and tell ya that
Tell ya how she get screwed and just strip for cash
I don't wanna hear that shit no more
Cause I'm drunk as fuck and my vision gone
They mixed my Henny up wit' Patron

[Hook]



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
I got these ideas, I got a lot on my mind
And it's so hard to put 'em in a lot of songs
I try to put 'em all in one, you know
Just what I'm feelin', what I'm goin' through
I've been drinkin', so please bear with me

[Verse]
Eyes wide shut, barely eatin', tryna get my game on
Played it too cool, almost like I'm froze, had to turn my flame on
All the while, watch 'em X me out
Magazine cover, mothafucka, I ain't tripping
My flow, senior citizen shit
And maybe they'll listen to me when they sixty
Breakin' some bread down, treat it like the Last Supper
Toast to all the time we were po', but still we had one another
Hoppin' in, out of shuttles, I'ma be big momma, I'ma get rich momma
I'm sorry, I ain't got a wife or kids momma, but look what I did momma
Got a house that I barely can stay in, a car I barely can drive
I'd be a liar if I said gettin' money didn't make me feel alive
Hustlin', arguin' about who’s better than I in tweets
But what does it matter when a new artist come out like every week?
And the label all on they nutsack, good for them, keep suckin'
Most rappers'll bend over for you, but me? Bitch, I'm not for fuckin', over
I'd be the biggest star, they told me
Signed my name on that line and when I die, that's when it's over
Movin' on to the set, I was just a talented black kid
But to them, I looked like a check
Another five years of slavin' and then it's on to the next
I was tryna be what I envisioned as a child
A king ain't a man of God when ain't no church in the wild
Shit been fucked up 'cause they don't talk about Christ
Everybody trying to die young but who gon' talk about life?
I pull that card, good Lord, Confederate flag, shit so flawed
They used to fly it like pilots and burn crosses in our yards
I can't get with ya if you with that whistlin' Dixie they want that old time back
But niggas got a hundred rounds and automatics so we ain't having that
I ain't promotin' no violence, it's people out here been wildin'
So much that you can get gunned down just for being happy and smilin'
Ain't no hotline worth dialin' to say the world needs help
We too busy fillin' our needs that we might kill us ourselves
I got my gumption from my granny, had a dream about her like last night
She held me tight and told me, "Little one, everything gon' be alright"
My mind playin' tricks on me, but I needed that there
In a world where I feel all alone sometimes I'm needin' her care
It's hard to share my insecurities so I medicate, I mean meditate
And pray to God for a second chance, for Heaven's sake
I'm just waitin' on a sign or two, like what I'ma do
When my heart get rusty and tired and it ain't shinin' through?
And I think about death a lot, my father scared of dyin'
I can relate, I call him before every flight, in case I ain't meant for flying
I can't hold it back, can't control these tears, I mean after all these years
I'm still the kid writin' poems, too shy to eat in the cafeteria
I'm two cups in and three shots away
I don't give a fuck about any of the shit I didn't have to say
Lord knows, it's hard to see the truth with your eyes closed
It's hard to protect your feelin's when you so exposed
Yeah, I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed

[Outro]
I let it all slip away
And now all I can say
Is here's a toast to a better day
And the love that will come and stay
Oh God, oh God, oh God, wherever You are, yeah
I call Your name near and far
Oh God, oh God, oh God, wherever You are, yeah
I call Your name near and far
I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
Oh God, oh God
Oh God, oh God
Oh yeah, uh



[Intro]
Everlasting
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'

[Chorus]
Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm askin' if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

[Verse 1]
I know this sound like one of those love songs
Perhaps it's on time since all the love's gone
And we trap it out, trap it out, but you don't like hip hop
'Cause you don't know what they rap about, nowadays I don't know either
But I ain't like most people
I'ma hit you with that "How you doin'? What you vibin' to and can I vibe with you?
And if the world was filled with flowers surrounded by waterfalls
And mountains despite the fact I just mentioned, can I lie with you?"
Shit, we outside the club though
And I'm knowin' what I'm sayin' make you wonder what I'm at the club for
To tell the truth I barely go out
I know your homegirl, she kick it with my partner, I tagged along with 'em
And they knew a friend that had a friend that I should meet
She don't like clubs, but she fall through sometimes just to see
So I'm guessin' that you her, it's just you and me
Let's skip out on this waterhole and find a place to be
In peace

[Chorus]
Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm asking if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

[Verse 2]
Ayy, excuse me shawty, if you don't mind me
Pointing out the fact you're just my type
I mean my type like when God broke the mold and designed you
From head to toe He know I'd fall in love with ya at first sight
I know that ain't no gangsta gangsta shit but I figured you hear
"I'm a hood nigga, fuck with me, damn you bad shawty" all the time
Don't get me wrong, that was me as a teenager
But I'm grown now and I think you deserve a better line
But not "line" like spit game, more like spiritual flames
To ignite the natural high that we all got
I know your homegirl told you don't fuck with us country boys
'Cause we players, but we all not
Now I admit I ain't perfect but who is nowadays?
A man can break your heart all sorts of kinda ways
But if you take my number down and hit me when you home
I can promise you I ain't shit like Tyrone
Excuse me shawty

[Chorus]
Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm asking if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

[Bridge]
Excuse me shawty
Excuse me shawty
Excuse me shawty

[Chorus]
Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm askin' if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

[Outro]
Excuse me shawty (ahahahah!)



[Intro]
Sleepy people, sleepy people
Tell me what's going on in your mind
Sleepy people, sleepy people
How can you sleep in these troubled times, times?
(Wake up!)

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on (what!)

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
I put the piece on chain, I did that shit for the haters
Made in the image of greatness, I got that there from my maker
Skipped over the minor leagues and took that shit to the majors
Fuck all that salt they was tossing, sauce got plenty of flavor
I'm on my shine like a chrome grill when the sun out like gold spill
That plate on the time machine that sat on some chrome wheels
For all of them busters that's faking front like they for the cause
Blocking the shots you taking cause they know you bout to ball on these hoes
King Tut with the gold, skating all on the low
Prison system enrolled, big time hope that you choke
All that bullshit that they serving
I come from where you whip it in the kitchen 'til it's twerking out the pot
Put my faith in God even when it's dark, I won't stop
Flip them high beams on, hit the gas to the top
I got love for my people, they got love for me
I know my power and my worth and they bullshit free

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
I put that house on hill just to startle the neighbors
Pull up, subwoofers still quaking, let it be known that I made it
From the box that they put me in because of my Nubian skin
Now I rollerskate in cul-de-sacs on twenty twen twens
Oh Lord, there goes the neighborhood
I'm whipping and dipping, the law won't stop me but wish they could
But the tag hood, digi dash good, nothing wrong here
Big bank, fuck what you think, I belong here on these
Hoes, ain't nothin' stopping me on my mission
Set my team up, raise my ring up if you play our position
Out the park when I swing, it don't matter who pitching
Boobie Miles under lights, hater this God-given
I can't wait on the government, got to do it myself
Stack all my chips up, never gon' slip-up case my folks need some help
Hey, I got love for my people, they got love for me
I know my power and my worth and they bullshit free

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
I got to get away from that bullshit that they on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on

[Outro: Rolynne Anderson]
Sleepy people, sleepy people
How can you sleep in these troubled times, times?
I gotta get away
Gotta get away
I gotta get away
Gotta get away
I gotta get away, ohhh
Gotta get away, ohhh, ohhhh
Ohh, hey, ohhh, get away
I gotta get away
I gotta get away, oh
I gotta get away



[Hook: Sleepy Brown & Big K.R.I.T.]
Trying to get up to come down
Got that playa shit by the pound
The gold with the lacs and the crown
Make it where them hoes come around
Trying to get up to come down
Booming like a sub-underground
The whole city hearin' it's around
We all on the get up to come down

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Back at it one mo' gain'
Cranking my motor, revving my engine
Chilling the AC 'til it's colder than a breeze in Alaska
Sun shine like the winter time just passed us, watching for laws and jackers
Cause this shit here too clean to be taken
I keep it tucked off in my clothes, you'll never catch me out here bucked naked
Fresh drawls, them deadstock Js for the caskets
Pressing up on these bastards that owe me and I gots to have it
Wake up and cake up 'cause it's only right
Soon as the sun go down, the freaks come out and they gon' dress in sum'n tights
I'm tryna dig deep, ginger ale and Hennessy
It keep me in the zone, I'm like long til' the clock strike twelve
One mo' then I'm out of the front door
On a mission like a Waffle House cook for the 2-4/7
Man, I'm just trying to get paid
And make it where these mothafuckas hate
I got up to come down

[Hook: Sleepy Brown & Big K.R.I.T.]
Trying to get up to come down
Got that playa shit by the pound
The gold with the lacs and the crown
Make it where them hoes come around
Trying to get up to come down
Booming like a sub-underground
The whole city hearin' it's around
We all on the get up to come down

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
This for those playas in those gator belts
Getting cheese like patty melts, serving up game like help yo' self
Refereeing, calling plays on the sidelines
Super the bowl, diamonds and gold, won a ring like five times
I remember wanting to be that cause I seen it
Don't ever tell a hoe you love a hoe if you don't mean it
Unless it's bout that paper paper, got that from a playa pimp
They say it's word to B-I, B-I, easier to be a simp
Put it in motion, rollercoasting
Peep the focus of a go-getter
If you flip it once and get it, it for sure figures
If you ain't eating with you squad, you's a hoe nigga
That's from the heart, never pump Kool-Aid when we on a mission
That's 24/7 like a waffle cook in a Waffle House kitchen
Man, I'm just trying to get paid
And make it where these mothafuckas hate
I got up to come down

[Hook: Sleepy Brown & Big K.R.I.T.]
Trying to get up to come down
Got that playa shit by the pound
The gold with the lacs and the crown
Make it where them hoes come around
Trying to get up to come down
Booming like a sub-underground
The whole city hearin' it's around
We all on the get up to come down

[Verse 3: Cee-Lo Green]
Now here's a little story that must be told
A wild young nigga off on Campbellton Road
I was raised on Kingsridge where there weren't no rules
Robbing niggas for they Starter jackets and shoes
Yeah, I've done some real things, family full of fiends
Forty ounce of Old English and some Newport kings
Went from a pocket full of pieces and '74 Caprices
A Benz and a crib in Buckhead, thank you, Jesus
Boy I'm Sweet James Jones when I'm whipping a Biarritz
A Rollie on my wrist and a super bad bitch
And you know it's southside, you can tell by the color
Give it a good look cause there'll never be another
Hoes, a hundred spokes, what you expect?
And trust me, money can't buy you that respect
Gotta feel it out of love, and get it from out the mud
And it'll come round, or get out the way
I'm coming down

[Outro: Big K.R.I.T. & Sleepy Brown]
Trying to get up to come down
Young playa worldwide, third coast all day
Mississippi well connected everywhere mayne
"4eva N a Day", 4eva howeva, 4eva anyway
You know how it be mayne
When you all the way down in the game underground
Trying to get up to come down
When you come up off that thang mayne
Them people can't stand you mayne
They can't, they can't get with it mayne
Cause they don't realize how or what it took
To get to a place where forever is a mighty long time
And all that time, you was doing it big
Trying to get up to come down
Somebody get fitted
4eva is, 4eva was and 4eva we will be
Multi til' the muthafuckin sun die
K-R-I-T, King Remembered In Time, believe that there
Trying to get up to come down
So as the beat keep rolling on, the slab keep hitting that
808 keep going on and the bassline keep being filthy and slashing
This is forever ever lasting in a timeless fashion, beitch!



[Hook: Big KRIT & Ashton Jones]
Cause we could be kings and queens
And highs and lows and wires and vogues
And anything that goes
And together we, are closest
It was meant to be, you're chosen
The best, I know, I know
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together

[Verse 1]
I'm talking early morning fresh
Get up, get out and get gone
Thank God for the sun and the chrome
That I pushed when we rolled
In that Brougham or Fleetwood 'Lac de Ville
Goosebumps trunk, yeah it gave ya chills
Popped up twice just to show your grill
Left the comfort of her home to roll with me
Cause she was searching for something real
I be that nigga, be that fresh
Leave that lame, be with a winner
Relieve that stress
Jump online, I free your mind
We don't need no dime, at least not mine
Spend this check
Buy that Benz or ride that Lex and drape our necks
Like kings and queens
Cause if you down to shine, I make love to your fertile mind
Till you conceive my dreams

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Let me be your one stop shop
Fill you up when you on E
Pick you up when you want feet
Be your guide, I be your eyes
When you can't see, I be your air
When you can't breathe
I give you game but it ain't free
You gotta be down for the play
When we up, we can shine, but prepare for the grind
Cause the Lac could break down any day
Would you be willing to hit licks?
I ain't the type to boast and nitpick
But it takes some hard work to get rich
It's a small risk to rock the red bottoms and bop the fresh fits
What you want, what you need
Gotta have, when we shop, gotta grab
Never hear, put em back, in fact
Just be careful how you spend you cash

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Just like highs and lows
Sub-woofers and vogues
We go good together, baby
We go good together, baby

Just like wires and vogues
Neon trunks and glow
We go good together, baby
We go good together, baby

[Hook]

[Outro]
Enjoy the fruits of your labor
The spoils of war
There's no harm in indulging
In the things that life has to offer
There comes a time in every king's life
Where the wine flows in abundance
And the tables are set
Feast and be thankful



[Verse 1: DeLorean]
Ain't every flower in the concrete bloomin'
Never walked through Bloomin's, it was gloomin'
Droppin' numbers for a feature
Western Union was my partner
I was tryna' get them bourbons on some choppers
Ridin' dirty through the city like I got you
Everything I had about ya blazing fire
I'mma quit when I cop me a couple prizes
It got hot up in that drive
I got tired of sweating bullets, like one day I gotta pull it
Yea - back against the wall, my ego turned into bully
I ain't moving, I ain't budging - I got buzzin' with no budget
Bloggers said I had it next, I was standing next to nothing
Conversations getting deeper, growing further from my people
Lost my love of life in high school I always knew she was a keeper
I was lost since, double crossed, bitch,  now I'm cross fit
Had to work a jelly for a outfit
Outskirts know me by my middle name, ain't no one to blame
Twenty thou', bust it down with the game, everything, mane

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Breaking bread, payin' dues, that's what got me through
Stacking hundreds 'til they blue, that's what got me through
Doing what a king do, that's what got me through
Pulling stunts with the crew, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
That's what got me through bitch, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
Play to win, making moves,  that's what got me through

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Pushing that Maxima with no cash in her
Fresh T so I ain't fastenin' up my belt
Back then I was jamming myself
Like who the fuck gon' tell me
I ain't gonna be the best that they ever heard?
Sipping 211's on the curb
Rollin' dime sacks for that herb and blow it down
What you know about that Greyhound on I-20, off the porch
Out the pen selling CD's outside of Magic City
That's dedication, preparation
My presentation too player made
Clockin' in like Flavor Flav
I'm selling lemon stand lemonade
My Forces bubble toed
Boosie fade turn 'em all even
Grandma think I'm smoking with the junkies cause I'm 160 somethin'
Barely eatin', but that prime time flow
When you been up like two days
Trap house, making beats for the low
50 dollars here, 100 dollars there
But when you're dead broke, everything gone
Thanking God for that place to stay in them showers
Even if they're cold
Them nice young women would cook me a plate for free, even if they hoes
So I don't take for granted steak and shrimp
Leave a healthy tip on the side
For all the times God showed me love
Even if I couldn't pay my tithes

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Breaking bread, payin' dues, that's what got me through
Stacking hundreds 'til they blue, that's what got me through
Doing what a king do, that's what got me through
Pulling stunts with the crew, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, bitch that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
Play to win, making moves, that's what got me through

[Verse 3: Big Sant]
Late night talking like early night
More like, everyday we was on a mission
To get off in a mansion, not off in a prison
Everywhere representing that 'sippi like we 'posed to, pimp
Take everything I love, put it on my shoulders, pimp throwed it
Everything stood in our way while we tryna build
Got crushed and folded
Now suddenly all the opponents writing rhymes and bending corners
Gimme 50 feet, you all up on me
Cause I don't believe you when you say you want it
And it's bigger than just tryin' to get it when you want to get it right
Went platinum, how to feed your kids like fighting for your life
When the choices wasn't even spoke, the rent or the lights
We all in the dark beggin' for sparks
And can't see the way whether day or the night
And some of them troubles just ain't worth the fight
But this is for pride, this is for niches
I need a witness we havin' church in the night
I guess that I'm doing alright
And thank God for good friends and cousins
Cause I could've been out here struggling
Talkin' about my should've, would've, could've havin' nothin'
When my nothing turns to something
Best believe you've gone to see
No matter how good I make it look, it ain't easy being me, OG

[Outro]
That's what got me through (got me through)
That's what got me through (Better believe it y'all)



[Chorus: Jill Scott]
It's like, I treasure each night
To know that you exist
In the midst of all this shit
You are my higher callin'

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Pick up when I call ya', I'ma be there in a second
Need directions when you get this message, somethin's goin' on
Earlier this mornin', had a feelin' that we might've hit the ceiling
And our purpose ain't fulfillin' in this home, so
Maybe we should take some time on it
Put a groove on, and bump and grind on it
And get our mind right, the stars align like our very vessels
And I know that we ain't planets but I'm knowin' somethin' special
Comes from callin' Heaven, dialin' seven's, waitin' on a pickup
Stomach bigger, skin is glowin', girl I love your figure
This is simple, this is real, somethin' to remember
Had to hit ya, so we could blend such a lovely mixture

[Chorus: Jill Scott]
It's like, I treasure each night
To know that you exist
In the midst of all this shit
You are my higher callin'

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Pick up when I call ya, I was starvin' for your garden
And I heard that you was thirsty, this is perfect, I got water
We could plant a seed and grow it, won't nobody know it
'Til' you showin', overflowin', overdoin', double soulin', hey
This ain't 'bout no bill collectors askin' you for time
Sally Mae can't get connected when you on this line
This is private, this a island, this is more than bein' worth it
This is callin' when yo' lights go out and they start back workin'
This is unexpected, such a blessing, had to tell you to express it
You wouldn't feel it if I texted no emojis were selective
Because I'm serious 'bout this here
Signal strong, I'm clear about this here

[Chorus: Jill Scott]
It's like, I treasure each night
To know that you exist
In the midst of all this shit
You are my higher callin'

[Outro: Big K.R.I.T.]
Hydration
Meditation, elevation
Celebration
Levitation, this is danger
Higher callin', higher callin'
Ooh, we got a higher callin', higher callin'
Higher callin', higher
Higher callin', higher



[Hook: Big KRIT]

How 'bout your hating friends that front when I'm on the town?
Really some bitch niggas, claiming it's going down
How 'bout them busty chicks?
How 'bout them stripper poles?
How 'bout them church girls who love to wear stripper clothes?
How 'bout she keep it shaking until she get bucket naked?
How 'bout she make a dollar and stop the procrastination?
How 'bout I been a king?
Lord of the gold rings
Really, I thought you knew
They nicknamed me high king
How about I make a note
To never ever going broke
Grabbed the [?] by it's throat
And never ever let it go

Wanna see what 60k look like?
Just look at my wrist
Aye, how 'bout that paper?
How 'bout my car?
I bought these diamond dancing like a motherfucking [?]
How 'bout that money?
I just smoked a onion
They asked me how I did it
Cause my city, I run it
Fell in love with your bitch
Cause her head was ironic
She get me sloppy really fast so I call her supersonic
You either sellin' dope or pimpin' bitches where I'm from
Live by the gun, die by the gun
Competition with myself and I already won
They get money a long time, they got a nigga sprung

How 'bout you keep it real?
How 'bout you make a move?
How 'bout you play the game?
How 'bout you pay some dues?
How 'bout you quit begging, and get off yo mama couch?
Way too much money to still be living at yo mama house
How 'bout you stop flexing?
Knowing your bills due
Stop with them sad stories
Nobody feels you
How 'bout you pay attention and peep how they do the pole?
Watch for them dirty laws, they kill you for being poor
How 'bout you get a buck?
Flip it and level up
Stack it and stack some more
Cause one stack just ain't enough
How 'bout I teach you class
You study, you have to pass
Pimping like 101
That lame shit will never last

[Hook: Big KRIT]

[Hook]
Shit, I got the hook up, bitch

Old school my whip
King Tut my wrist
I got the hook up, bitch
What you know 'bout this?
I put on my clique
Hoes on my dick
How you love that?
I got the hook up bitch
What you know 'bout this?

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Fuck what you heard, ho, they know bout the Krizzle
The Chevy on four Pirellis with the pole in the middle
I break a ho if she brittle, pimpin' hot off the griddle
Cluckin' bustas freakin' and fuckin' for nothing
So how you figure I was tricking off?
Candy paint my Caddy frame don't be ashamed to lick it off
Hail Mary some game to a dame and you can't pick it off
Off the chain (Hoo!) I can't sic it off
Time and time again I try and tell them let me kick it off
And bang on it, I put these lames on it
It ain't Multi if ain't put my name on it
Make that kinda track and put a train on it
Styrofoam, purple rain on it
Fresh up out the cleaners, my demeanor, not a stain on it
Reign on it, put some chains on it, bet the game on it
My woofer beat to the frequency that a bitch done came on it
Pinky ring on em, chinchilla get hanged on the floor
I leave a bitch fiending for some more

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big SANT]
Yeah, B-izza G SANT, biatch
Young trill nigga, ho you know just what I be bout
Time to take off them T tops, we on that, like banners
Man hold up, my car older than your favorite rapper
This that shit that they should capture on film
Lights camera action, life
Bitch my pimpin' 1080p, without a satellite
Why niggas ain't acting right, talkin' 'bout who run the South
They know it's us
They sick and ain't no Robituss to help ‘em out
I been official, big dawg in the yard
Voted most likely to murder every verse that I start
So as soon as I park and I hop on that ride
Better leave with your bitch, 'fore I'm off in her mouth
Cuz I'mma big timer rhymer, no co-signers around for you
If I ain't make that clear let me break it down for ya
They lame (yeah), we not (yeah), see us (yeah) on top (yeah)
Alumni forever ever bitch
They know

[Hook]



[Hook]
I'm hydroplaning
It's been a long time since I felt this way
Since I, since I felt this way
I'm hydroplaning
It's been a long time since I felt this way
Since I, since I felt this way
I'm hydroplaning
It's been a long time since I felt this way
Since I, since I felt this way
I'm hydroplaning
It's been a long time since I felt this way
Mix the drank with the dank got, got me, got me

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Thunder cracking, another day to be chilling
Nothing to do but roll up and po' up and catch that feeling I had
Back when I was younger, used to bum from my partner's uncle
Had that smoke that smelled like dumpster
Something missing, I'm way too high to talk my pimping
So I sip my Remy, that's when I first got tunnel vision
Yea I saw it clearly, sunshine never shine like this
When I was sober off in the ? I never rhymed like this
I think I'm tripping, no I'm high, no I'm throwed
Well all I know is that my world is super slow
I like this better, light as a feather, too fly to land
Too throwed to drive in this weather
I'm hydroplaning

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
It's getting harder to explain the way I feel when I'm zoned
High as fuck, money stuck so don't call my phone
See I was young when I was tipping, but I wasn't tripping though
Perfect combination of elevation had me tipping slow
Fall asleep while we ride, cloud surf to my house
I never knew the strength of the drink until I melt away in my couch
And dream about the things I never had and all the places I couldn't go
Tried to play it cool around my folk but I was fucked up on the low
Eyes bloodshot red, can't get to my bed
Cup of lean in my stomach, ounce of smoke in my head
I ain't been this way in a while, it's cool, I need to relieve the stress
With all of the worries of this life, I blew it out my chest
I'm hydroplaning

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Devin the Dude]
Tryna hold on
But I'm steady getting higher as the sweet meets the fire again
Round 10, toe to toe with the green
See me I'm bobbing and weaving but he's choking me and cheating mane
Tryna train my lungs, to hang
Cause I'm gonna be smoking 'til Kingdom Come
Sang the songs that chose to make people roll up the mota
(And feel good like they supposed ta)
Wanna stay grounded but somehow gravity pulls me up
Am I upside down? Man what the fuck
Going on mane, hydroplaning
As I'm going up, not going insane but
Out of control, feel like it's out of my hands
Let me grab a hold before I crash land
Because it's like I'm going crazy, hydroplaning
I'm hydroplaning!



[Hook]
I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here
I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here
I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here
Big backyard with a house on the hill
Old school whip with some big ass rims

[Bridge]
Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes

[Verse 1]
Well I suppose niggas gon' hate on me
Well that's cool
I got shows, getting money I can barely fold
Cause that's what I do
And ain't nobody gon' pimp K-R-I-T
Yea, that's how I feel
And them diamonds niggas always rhyming 'bout
Pressed against my wheel
And ain't nobody gon' check none of me or mine
In God I trust
If you think I'm out here tricking these hoes
You got me fucked up
And ain't no playing in the south, turn a bad bitch out
When I grab my pipes
Y'all niggas think this shit came oh so easy
It wasn't over night, but

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Now I suppose I'm doing quite alright
Ever since I blew
Don’t be worryin' bout me an don’t worry bout mine, player
Worry about you
And ain't nobody gon' block my shine today
With the roof gone
I got a top notch bitch, you need something like this
But you gotta get your own
And ain't nobody gon' wreck this hard
When I'm traveling down the boulevard
Now they hollering out "Oh my God!"
Cause they never seen rims this large
"That's country shit"
Well that's cool cause I'm country, bitch
I never turn my back, I burn on wax
And stack my cash 'til I'm country rich, cause

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I got this here, I got this here
Chevys on that chrome
Live and in my zone
'Til a player gone
I got this here, I got this here
Doing it how I feel
Doors open for hoes
Haters in my grill
I got this here, I got this here
Diamond in the back
Slamming on these doors
Trunk beat 'til it crack
I got this here, I got this here
Get it how I live
Smoking on that good
Cracking on my seal

[Hook]

[Bridge]



[Intro: Melanie Fiona]
A, will you uh uh uh uh catch me if I fall?
Will you uh uh uh uh catch me if I fall?
Will you uh uh uh uh catch me if I fall?
Yea, I gave my all

[Verse 1: Big Krit]
Cheah, aye I'm a man so I stand on my own two
I give a damn about a hater and his whole crew
No jump shot so I'm selling crack
To tell you the truth, I've been to Hell and back
No food in the kitchen so I'm scrapin' scraps
Tightest nigga in the world can't afford to rap
Now I'm on the hunt for a nigga to jack
Soon as I get rich I swear I'm givin' it back
It's cold out here, you gotta hold your own
I never knew what pain was until I was grown
I never miss my home boy until he was gone
But life goes on
So if I call

[Hook: Melanie Fiona]
If I fall by the river bed
Would you save me or leave me dead?
All the blood I shed
And I'll just rest my head

[Verse 2: Big Krit]
Cheah, ain't nothin' easy 'bout the life I chose
Wasn't much of a choice, just the life I know
Smokin' weed, drinkin' liquor just to kill time
When I'm fucked up, the only time I feel fine
Mama say I'm lettin' life go by
As if I ain't grindin', as if I don't try
But you can see in the eyes, she worry 'bout her baby
Late night, scared a nigga might play me
Police in the street don’t phase me
Get it how you live let em chase me
Bills still due, yea I can't stall
But that ain't all
So if I call

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Krit]
Cheah, I used to love 'er, I used to hold 'er
She made me promise I'd never let 'er go
She made me smile, could've had my child
I held her tight like I never held before
But things change when you get older
She started drinkin' cause I ain't sober
That's when I told 'er
"Be careful 'bout the friends you keep
Cause the ones you call friends ain't friends to me"
Now we don't see eye to eye
The more I tell her the truth, the more she lies
The more we shoot each other down, the more we die
I think it's best that I said goodbye
So when I call

[Hook]



[Hook: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
My forever baby  in the darkness
I never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
Oh no, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
And that’s forever baby, and that’s forever baby
You're my sunshine  in the darkness
Leave ya lonely, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
A puppet on some strings, she had me gone
Cause even if I was married with kids, no goin' home
She like,  “If you could sleep with an angel between the sheets
Would you give up your beliefs as I proceed to spread my wings?"
I’m like, If it’s good enough, maybe, I guess
I’m no saint I admit, sometimes I fall victim to flesh
I think you worth the regrets
Ifs and the maybes, I'll be down for pleasure
I think you should save it, let me rephrase it
Magic woman, palm reader, to say that you bomb
My records turn, [?]
I know your chakras aligned
The world can't define our spiritual bond
You more than sunshine in the dark

[Bridge: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
Let it shine like gold Put a Spell on you
Forever Baby you wanna say something
She let it shine like gold

[Hook: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
My forever baby  in the darkness
I never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
Oh no, never leave ya lonely
And that’s forever baby, and that’s forever baby in the darkness
You're my sunshine  in the darkness
Leave ya lonely, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness

[Bridge 2: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
Woa, and I think about you every time na-na
I think about ya every time na-na
Na-nanananana Na-nananana na-na-na-na
Let me see ya baby
Don’t worry bout any of them problems
I can see the light in you baby
In the darkest of dark you are my sunshine
Why don’t you come over
Woa brother, ye-yeah yeah you are my sunshine
Oh my sunshine baby

[Hook: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
My forever baby  in the darkness
I never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
Oh no, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
And that’s forever baby, and that’s forever baby forever baby
You're my sunshine  in the darkness
Leave ya lonely, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness

[Outro: Big K.R.I.T.]
Hold up I’m trippin'

Man, fuck an old school
This is...
Come on, Lucille
Turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on, turn on, goddamn!
Yo Lucille if you don't turn on I'ma leave you out here for these motherfuckers to take!
Fuck it!
I'll get out here on foot, I don't care
I'ma make it to where I need to go
Shit, I'll make it happen,  I'll make it to where I need to go
*Sigh*
That look familiar, I've been that way, and I've seen people go that way
Ooh, I really liked it when I went that way, but I can't do that no more
Mm..
I'ma try this way
Yeah, I'ma do this. I'ma do something different, I'ma go this way



[Hook]
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play
On the radio every single day
It’s better this way
Ain’t no telling when it’s gon' change
Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way
Better this way
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play
On the radio every single day
It’s better this way
Ain’t no telling when it’s gon' change
Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way

[Verse 1]
It’s that, It’s that Krit remind you of that shit
You used to play
In your parents car
Had you feel in as if outer space
Was in your atmosphere
ATLiens all in your ear
Tired of being outcasted
I hope that means you outta here
Nowadays we flex so much
Get a check so much
We never chill
Way to drunk to drive
High as fuck
Plus we poppin pills
Celebrate the very shit
That slow us down and probably kill
Song ain’t even jamming though
Number one in every ville
Got that on repeat
Right before you wake
On your way to work
On your way to church
Stuck in traffic
Right before you go to sleep
I know you tired
Of that overdrive
That commercialized sing along
Wonder why they play this song all the time

[Hook]
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play
On the radio every single day
It’s better this way
Ain’t no telling when it’s gon' change
Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way

[Verse 2]
I didn’t know about you till you recognized
It wasn’t paid for or televised by the label
You couldn’t see it all on cable or
Advertised at award shows
I didn't beef with none your favorite rappers
Or drop a sex tape after
Claiming it leaked off of my cellphone
When really I’m tryin' to sell more
And I wouldn’t just say anything
On the radio just to get fame
Or trap it out, gangster rap it out
Knowin' I ain’t never sold a thang
Bust a dime on the coffee table
Really shorty I went to school
I wasn’t friends with the son
Of the executive that ran the label
I had to pay dues
Wasn’t no blueprint where I come from
I couldn’t blow up in the backyard
Couldn’t walk the streets with my Cd
Give it to a DJ, like that's hard
And he play it everyday 'till I got a deal
Album date and advanced tour
My takeover wasn’t overnight
To be honest with you, it was a gift from god

[Hook]
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play
On the radio every single day
It’s better this way
Ain’t no telling when it’s gon change
Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way
It’s better this way

Say you got it, well show me

Everybody wanna be a pimp nowaday
But don’t nobody wanna break a ho
Kick a do’ when the plane don’t fly
Get your blimp nowadays

That fire, ho, motherfuck all my rivals
Same niggas talkin' shit 'bout me won't ride fo', but I'll slide fo'
What I believe, don't trip, let the trunk bang
I'm still a country motherfucker, shawty, I'm gettin' head while I'm grippin' grain
I spend a grip on a pinky ring, I blew a tire, threw the car away
I did it big in the club last night, but a nigga goin' hard today

[Hook]
Ain't no way I could be losing when I'm winning
Losing when I'm winning
Glass house, never ever tinted, let them see me in it
Celebrate the grind and the vision, Lord we independent
Country nigga made them pay attention, we ain't even finished
Gotta keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin'
Lord  keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin' for you one time, multi 'till the sun die

[Verse 1]
Woke up out my dream, me and my life's supreme
Fuck you mean?
Went from rags to riches on the scene, now they call me king
Father saw my crib like, this the wildest shit he'd seen
Living proof that God got a plan if I don't intervene
Old school cleaner than a bitch put it on some heels
Round table eating with my team, let me catch the bill
Touching down
Fuck you niggas out here always hating
If I listen to your barking, I might never get this paper
Kept it playa from the rooter to the tooter to the tomb
I been on it since Ms. Rhonda went and pushed me out the womb
Hallelujah! Ain't no losing when your winning on the court
I supplied my own demand, ain't no way I come up short

[Hook]
Ain't no way I could be losing when I'm winning
Losing when I'm winning
Glass house, never ever tinted, let them see me in it
Celebrate the grind and the vision, Lord we independent
Country nigga made them pay attention, we ain't even finished
Gotta keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin'
Lord  keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin' for you one time, multi 'till the sun die

[Verse 2]
Hoped up out my whip with the candy drip
April showers when they lay me down
Underground, I won't smell the flowers
So I'm only up early morning putting plans in motion
I can't let this go to waste, nigga out here been losing focus
Chasing after hoes and acceptance from the non-believers
How the fuck you judge the South if you never ever seen it?
That's just on the real, fuck you if you think its cotton fields
Nigga we out here buyin cribs bigger than the buildings that you in
Put that on my grill, that's just how I feel
Blow a check, looking like I'm King Tut
All this gold around my neck
Lord, Hallelujah! For the shine I was given
All the hate I don't mind
I'll recline cause I'm winning

[Hook]
Ain't no way I could be losing when I'm winning
Losing when I'm winning
Glass house, never ever tinted, let them see me in it
Celebrate the grind and the vision, Lord we independent
Country nigga made them pay attention, we ain't even finished
Gotta keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin'
Lord  keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin' for you one time, multi 'till the sun die

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
I'm talking, like, sonic booming, like Jackson State. You know what I'm saying, like, a trunk of the old school whip. Driving by your grandmomma house trying not to wake her up, but you keep hitting donuts cause you ain't got nowhere to go kind of 808 sub booming system. The interior fucked up, but you really don't care at all. Nah, your playa-potnas wanna ride with you, but they don't give you no gas money kind of booming. I'm talking about '99. SLAB vogues, get you an adapter. You don't really want your rims to scrub and all, but that just how it be. Sub on. (echoes)



[Chorus]
Lord, be my witness
Gotta keep the devil off (Gotta keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Gotta keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Can't worry 'bout no snakes (Worry 'bout no snakes)
What good are those riches
If you're six feet under? Lord, be my witness
Keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)

[Verse 1]
I was born on the Southside of the moon
Country boy did this big from the bottom of the map
To the top of the mountain, pimpin', I'm on the move
I'm in the groove on the late night
I make the move if the play right
You ain't seen it like I seen it
My vision nowadays 'bout as bright as the daylight
Supernova; I made a strong foundation
Outta all these boulders I carry
I ran them snakes in my yard
And you were tuckin' your tail, actin' all scary
We ain't cut from that cloth (Well)
I paid in gold what I bought (Well)
I ran circles 'round y'all
And never, ever, ever got caught (Wooh)

[Chorus]
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Can't worry 'bout no snakes (Worry 'bout no snakes)

If you're six feet under? (Under) Lord, be my witness
Keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Can't worry 'bout no snakes (Worry 'bout no snakes)
What good are those riches (Those riches)
If you're six feet under? (Under) Lord, be my witness
Keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)

[Verse 2]
I was born underneath the pecan tree (Pecan tree)
With the soul of giant and the heart of a lion
But now world couldn't wait for an OG
I was creepin', crawlin', fallin' out the shack
Backwards slippin' upward through the crack
Now I creep in storage where you want to be
But barely get to see but never ever at paid for
I made more than they thought I would on my tax
I mix the candy with the grain
And the soul with the swang and the bang
And that's called bounce
We ain't cut from that cloth (Well)
I paid in gold what I bought (Well)
I ran circles 'round the non-believers
The feds, the people and never got caught (Wooh!)

[Chorus]
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Can't worry 'bout no snakes (Worry 'bout no snakes)
What good are those riches (Those riches)
If you're six feet under? (Under) Lord, be my witness
Keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off
Ain't worry 'bout no snakes (Worry 'bout no snakes)
What good are those riches (Those riches)
If you're six feet under? (Under) Lord, be my witness

[Bridge]
Gotta keep the devil off (Keep the devil off)
Keep the devil off, devil off
Keep the devil off, devil off
Keep the devil off, devil off
Keep the, keep the devil off
Keep the, keep the devil off
Keep, hol' up, the—

[Hook]
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
Grew up on the country side of town

[Verse 1]
M-I crooked my nigga
Do it for the south, ya'll know
Born and raised where the rebel flag hang from the slaves
Grew up where ya'll niggas won't go
Rep that, rep that shit like I own it
I did it big for my fam and my homies
I got the biggest house on my block, foreign with the drop
For the times I was out here homeless, God flow
Time and time again I tried to tell these niggas
Yo what I say to these niggas?
Reebok, on tap dance, do whatever for a sack
Give a lap dance bitch ass nigga
Fee-fi-fo coked up
25 lighters on my dresser, ain't shit changed
Rollin' in the  ham sandwich on propellers lookin' like a strech
I'm so clean you think I might be selling cocaine
Light at the end of the tunnel
When you're flexin' it's hard to be humble
Talkin' fourth down, can't throw the ball to Def Jam
Cause they might fumble
Kick that south flow that you can't get
Try to fuck the world but my dick won't fit
My bitch like "KRIT, motherfuck they feelings
You wanna be king, gotta claim that shit"
I'm talkin' 'bout off with they heads
When you put on a mink, gotta creep down stairs
When you come from the country
Your feet on the snakes would will make clothes out of bears
I ain't playin' no games
I leave with the future, you follow these lames
I embody the South, the swing, the grain
The trunk with the bang, the gold in their mouth

[Hook]
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
Grew up on the country side of town

[Verse 2]
Ain't no love in the coliseum
This shit here been a bloodsport
Keep what you kill, fuck if they live
Cause everybody out here cutthroat
I've been quietly waitin'
Deep in my dungeon, my stomach was rumblin', my belly was achin'
Everybody wanna see a monster
Till they see the monster, the monster holla out, "What's shakin'?"
I know what you thinking, this nigga shit, must not be stankin'
He must not know better at all
Titans collide, only Zeus could survive
If not me bitch, who the fuck you gone call?
To rain from the mountain tops
Still blood stains on the leaves
I don't do it for the blog spot comment box, I do it for the OGs
And them country folk that can't talk that shit
This ain't your curb, don't walk that bitch
This ain't your porch, so keep off that shit
Go find a cliff and jump off that bitch
If you don't think that I'm king
I done proved them wrong like twice, can't stop my fight
I could murder your favorite rapper
And all I get is "No way a Mississippi nigga really that nice!"
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em
I said it six times cause it's my pleasure
Say it one more time for just for good measure, fuck em
Raised by the King that before me
Slowly crept up and still paid dues
I embody the South, the swang, the bang
The soul and the pain and the blues

[Hook]
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
Grew up on the country side of town



[Intro: DJ Drama]
Let's go, K.R.I.T
See when it comes to god given talent
And whenever form is given
Most of us learn our journey at a early age
Sometimes the worlds teaching
Guides us to the highest path
Other times, the teacher negates our gifts
And blocks the shine
I'm here to tell you
When you're destined for greatness
No roadblock can stop that journey
Don't follow the leaders, be the leaders

[Verse]
I was prepared for the worst
Dug in deep, cause I emerged from the dirt
My nigga said "You ain't the only one"
But in truth, you got to be the first
Cause you can see the good and the bad
And you'll turn down the bad
That's a gift and a curse
I envy your will to be a better man
In a world where a better man don't even stand a chance on this earth
Bible talk, they told me that I can keep that
This time I'll leave the sheep where the sheep at
And I pray that when the wolves fall through
Their stomach still full, so they won't eat that
Which is mine? I really think I'm wasting time
Worried 'bout my people and all they sayin'
Fuck me cause I was too determined to ball
But if you knew that you could fly, nigga why did you fall?
I'm feeling like LeBron more than ever
They givin' nigga the praise, but I'm knowing that I'm better
So, fuck a ring if it don't make me a great
Why you doing too much? I'ma do what it takes
I got a chip on my shoulder the size of a boulder
That a giant wouldn't even bother to hold up
Like, Krizzle why you carrying this?
Cause it ain't enough soil I can bury it with
And it ain't enough weight, that's the scariest shit
That means I was built for more, trial and error
Almost burst into tears when I saw my brother's kids
Like I coulda have this, I gotta keep it together
But I've been chasing, way too much chasing
They'll never give me what I deserve, just face it
Fuck faking, fuck pretending like you know my story
Or what it's like to be mistaken as a basic
Country bumpkin, watermelon
Chicken-eatin', collard greens
Neckbone chillin' motherfucker
We’re the butt of all jokes grew up here
And we'll show you have no clue of what it's like to be southern
Knowing you a king and in spite all you dream
Had to be a nightmare for you to wake up
And those two hour meetings with the label betting money on
Another excuse that they'll scrape up
For me to do it out of pleasure, another pay cut
And they wonder why a nigga never say much
I never was the begging type
I couldn't picture this shit, I never cared for likes
I never cared for what your opinion would be
And even if I did, nigga shame on me
I live my life, a hundred fucking miles and running
Only for a nigga to sit and try to tell me something about the music
Culture, consumer, vultures
The music that I make ain't for radio, bogus
The people just wanna hit the club and have fun
And I don't make that kind of shit and that's really the culprit
Art is art no matter how you sculpt it
Mold it, grow it, only to go unnoticed
Cause nowadays we just focus on them thots
And niggas selling kool aid on a soapbox
I'm imprisoned to my mission, screaming listen
Lord I wish I could stop
I wish I could tell them 'bout the book
But they caught up in the movie, lights and the props
The pyro, and the award shows and the fancy clothes
And well-offs, extorting the have nots
Man, fuck this shit

[Skit: Big KRIT & Unknown Old Head]
Aw, shit. Look it here. Here he go. I know you gonna say something about that, 86. 86 ain’t even worth nuth–
‘Ey. 'Ey

[Hook: Big KRIT]
4eva is a mighty long time
I do it for the South and them folks that held me down
Forever in the game, forever Multi
Forever getting mine, forever on the grind
What's a king without a crown ho?
What's a car without some sound ho?
What's a king without a crown ho?

[Verse 1]
Sometimes all I need a bass
And a little liquor to ease my mind a bit
Cause even when you polished, niggas won't let you shine for shit
That pot to piss in turned into a house on hill
I'm talkin' two stories no fabrication, that's a true story for real
And ain't no ghost writer, my flow tighter than gorilla fists
Keep it poppin' like hot grease, fried up with your catfish
Cut throat with that bucket seats, bust a quiche, I split her peach
Young Krizzle, fruit ninja, crouching tiger, hidden freak
Ho what's up, I got more to tell
Dreams is cheap I got more to sell
Crush linen, grain grippin', don't touch my buttons
I hate it when a bitch gets overzealous
So chill ho
I got a point to prove, that's the reason I rhyme fo'
Third coast, I put it down fo'
What's a king without a crown ho?

[Verse 2]
K-R-I-T
One more time for them folk that didn't know
Two more time for them folk that didn't listen
Three more time for them folk that said growth
Was impossible, for a country boy
Like they could spit, like they could flow
Shawty everybody wanna be a rapper
But everybody out can't do a show
So I'm slammin' doors and work the wheels on her
Pop my bands and pop a bill on her
Shit changed since Krit Wuz Here
I raise my glass and crack a seal on her
Cause I deserve that, got a old school
Let me swerve that, in my own lane
I make my own beats, I write my own rhymes
I grip my own grind, I grip my own grain
And that's royalty
How else I'm 'sposed to live?
I made do with what God gave, I do exactly what I feel
Yeah I play my part and I gave my heart and I represent for my crib
Just like them kings that came before me, I'mma keep it trill
Let's go!

[Hook]
4eva is a mighty long time

[Intro]
Let's create
Nah not yet
I'm ready to create now
Naah not yet, hold on
No, let's create now
Aight

[Hook]
Let's just take our time
Pretend like we started this
Pretend like we are creation
Pretend like it's all on us to be perfect
How about, let's just be perfect
And let us not pretend that we ain't made in God's images
Let's make good on these promises and be perfect
How about let's be perfect

[Verse 1]
These hands of mine can hold the weight of planets
Allow me to use the hues of lunar cools to paint a canvas
Of explosions and vibrant emotions that we know we could
Explore the outer most with no risks, even though we know we should
You are the ocean, I am a mountain
When a piece of me falls off in you there's no way of countin'
The days and times another you and me will arrive
But watch it grow to reach the sky
Emoted to be like  you and I
I hope it has your glowing eyes
The light, the dark
I won't refuse it love, instead I'll give it heart
Probably the same color as Mars
Was shining, blinding stars
To the fathers afar
Until it reaches God

[Hook]

[Break]
I know what this means
You are all my sins
On this back seat car
Do it big, do me baby
I know what this means
You wanna be a star
Won't you Shake it for me, shake it for me baby
Do it like you love me, do it like you love me
Do it like you love me, do it like you love me
Oooh do it like you love me, do it like you love me
Baby, baby, baby

And feelin' so good, thug bitch from the hood, but really though
Might get some ass tonight, hit it like a real man should, I'ma kill it though
Make a right, open that 'frigerator, crack that 40 ounce
Head into your momma room so I can hear that naughty sound, don't play around
Your parents ain't around, and plus your room is packed
I'ma hit it from the front, I'ma hit it from the back, bust it like a gat, pat pat
Kissin' party with a couple bad bitches, gettin' dirty with all of my niggas
Feelin' woozy but I'm pourin' more liquor
But the cutie booty couldn't be bigger
I'm celebratin' cause we shouldn't be here
Hella faded cause the Hennessy near

Slow motion, I'm still posted
In the cut, been waitin' my turn
Fell off cause you wasn't yourself
Oh well, nigga live and you learn
Money don't concern me, I was too determined
Fuck what you heard, I feed my fam
I put on for mine, I let my brother shine
And I be comin' down like goddamn
We made it, that check on me, my nigga
For what it's worth, I don't go to work
So this verse ain't free, my nigga
This work ain't free, my nigga
Yeah it's above average cause they're raisin' taxes
Dropped twelve albums, that's a grand apiece
And plus I made the beats, you do the mathematics
No watches, no dope money, I'm just Southern
One of the coldest niggas that's in the game
And I've only been on one major cover, like damn
Either they don't know, they don't show
Or they don't care what happens in the South
Or either I'm too smart, or they too dumb

I come from the bottom, name of the cotton
Do whatever just to profit
Who is that knockin' off in the projects
'Fridgerator, empty pockets
Just a dream of makin' dollars
Fly my mama to the tropics
When you barely used to make it by
You were do or die now we got it
Look at how we livin' now
Skyscraper tall, built from the ground
Tired of seein' my pops go to work
Can't wait 'til the day he can lounge
Promise that I do it big
For my family and my friends
Took some losses just to win
Put Multi 'til the end

Gotta represent, I do it for my hometown

You think you are ballin' but you ain't even hit the court
I throw money at bitches like you would think it's a sport
We pop bottles and be out like like we just wanna rain
Big [?] or models, they twerk that pussy all the same
I got two gold chains, and two bad bitches
All these bands in my pockets, it's hard to pull up my britches
I put the "K" in Kountry
I put the "P" in pimpin'
I give a fuck what you think, shorty
And fuck how you're feelin'

[Hook]
I let it show (yeah-h-h) (x3)
I'm outchea all night
With the highs and lows

[Verse 2]
You don't pay my bills, you don't write these songs
You don't know my life, naw bitch I'm grown
You can hold them rocks
You can throw that salt
If the ho chose me, pimpin', it ain't my fault
I got two old schools, one for the boppers
And one with the engine that get away from them coppers
I put the "B" in bumpin'
I put the dub in whippin'
I give a fuck what you think, shorty
And fuck how you're feelin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Tell Def Jam run that bread, I don't give a fuck
Drop top, goods, bitch I gave my whip a tummy-tuck, uhh
I beat that pussy like it ain't the same, shorty
Shit, you might just put my name on it
Roll around town like I own the whole city
Fuck the hotel, brung the whole club with
Lame motherfuckers, gotta get 'em out my way
I got a new bad bitch like I get married everyday
I ain’t no trapper, I ain’t no rapper so don’t push me to no killer
This money is a jungle, I'm a silverback gorilla
The house sit on some pillars
Dolamite my kin
I'm knockin' doors down like my trunk Pacific rim

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm outchea all night, with the highs and lows
I'm outchea all night, with the wives and [?]
I'm outchea all night night, with the neon glows
I'm outchea all night, with your wife and your ho

[Big Krit]
Back one more ‘gain for all them players
Natural women and mindframe elevators
Ten toes down with this experimental south sound
Dope up the lines enough to go around and around and around this world thrice over
Ain’t nothing new under the sun back in ’05, I tried to told ya
We here 4Eva in a day, can’t go back with this one way
Take you to where the grass is much greener
Putting in work for my redeemer
Yea that’s the most high
I ain’t talking ‘bout blunts rolled
But like saved souls and warm welcomes at front doors
Don’t let your problems weigh you down
Don’t let them burdens slow yo pace
The quickest way from A to Z is straight
On that narrow path, a road less traveled
So free yo mind and be one with time ‘cause that’s all that matters
Not all that riff raff or random chit chatter
Haters scatters like jacks do
Don’t drop the ball unless you can pick up all the weight that a winner has to
Don’t let the struggle outlast you
Even if society outcasts you
Stand strong in your belief
The mountain top ain’t hard to see
When you let God and let be
Live From the Underground



[Intro]
Life is a gamble, oh baby
Where you win or lose
Life is a gamble

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
They say life (is a gamble)
So be careful when you shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
They say life (is a gamble)
So be careful when you shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I roll the dice one time for my folks that died off
Rep the side they believe in but they side lost
Let me toss a seven for the ones won't see tomorrow
Cash those chips in for some time we don't need to ball
Gunshots ran out, everybody hang out
Yellow tape party, all over we sang out
I don't like this feeling, ain't nothing that appealing
Bout reminiscing, over you, my God
I couldn't cry cause your mama couldn't stop crying
And that's hard, lord I wish my folks would stop dying
But who am I to say it wasn't your time to black out?
You betted all on a spot, I guess you crapped out
For the finer things, indeed we chase
We told you pace yourself
It's funny, how the things we love, can make us hate ourselves
Russian roulette table, I gotta bet safer
You gotta know when to fold your cards
When you ain't able to reach into that dash when that
Jackal up and flashed that, brass like
Give me all you got or that's your ass
That's all that it would took, the house got me shook
Cause ain't no point spread, but god doing books

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Life is a gamble feel like I'm rambling sometimes
Like what the fuck I'm sposed to say in this rhyme
I shed tears and they won't come back
I said the word and they won't run back
My slot machine was broken this time
Ain't no tokens, I can't redeem to preserve the focus of mine
So many died and I'm scared it's just a matter of time
For I'm lifted myself, six people I know
Ain't been in church in a while, I heard I reap what I sow
Casket close, Caddy doors, can't commemorate
This tracks my gurney, my verse can be the ventilator
So I breathe, cause Loathing in Las Vegas wasn't meant for me
Too scared I'll stay too long and forget where I'm really meant to be
Heaven maybe, heaven lately, but all these lights are captivating
I had to play it, for the sake of me and mine
Lord, I pray I hit it big this time

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Transmission I miss my mark day one
I was so close to the sun, I burnt the top off my roof
I travelled a million miles to uncover what most would doubt
Although I believe in God, I need proof
I'm itching for conversation, answer if you can hear
Where you lost amongst shining stars?
Life can seem oh so clear, death can seem oh so near
Dodging these comets, I promise my baby I be back if I lose cons-(cuts off)
Tell her I love her, I miss her
I keep her picture upon my dash
And I wish her the best of luck, that's if I crash
I saw a flash just the other day while I was making haste
Could be reaching, but I found a beacon attention base
I get paranoid swerving around these asteroids
Lord forbid I have to abort my mission
But it gets hard when you searching in the dark
For that one and only spark
I think I see what's missing

[Hook]
I found life
I found life
I found life upon this planet
Damnit, I've been damaged
But I I can manage
I won't take this for granted, life
I found life
I found life
I found life upon this planet
Damnit, I've been damaged
But I I can manage
I won't take this for granted, life

[Verse 2]
I found life, in the darkest of times
How can I describe what's God's design
With these faulty eyes that often lie
Stars shine bright but they often die
I'm asking for permission to perceive
I'm closer than I've ever been
I probably shouldn't leave
I probably should record some of the things that I perceive
To be more sublime and divine than you and me

[Hook]
I found life
I found life
I found life upon this planet
Damnit, I've been damaged
But I I can manage
I won't take this for granted, life
I found life
I found life
I found life upon this planet
Damnit, I've been damaged
But I I can manage
I won't take this for granted, life

[Outro]
The planet Cadillactica was created within the history of the big bang,  or what we like to call the 808. Now we are privileged to experience something sonically never heard before. Wait wait, it's starting



[Hook]
Pushin' rhymes underground like moonshine
With jump like juke joints
Ridin' like old 'lacs
Down like 4 flats
Shine like gold grills
Curls and chrome rims
Bitch you know what it is
I'm Live from the underground, underground
Live from the underground, underground
Underground, underground
Live from the underground railroad

[Verse 1]
My papa told me get paper, motherfuck a hater
Them J's look clean son but elevate to gators
I took that shit to heart plus I dug it like a crater
I'm givin' out game player are there any takers
While you was quarter sackin' I was quarterbackin
Callin' plays everyday, level All-Madden
Hi five, cloud nine, private jet lackin'
Treat the seal like a vinyl record, gotta keep it crackin'
Shall I pour up, blow some smoke up, get my spit on
Grab a paper, sit on a track and get my shit on
Ice cold water with the flow minus the lemon
I'm Cinematic Multi, what label you been on
Old school ridin' flickin' ashes in the tray
Smokin' up the booth blowin' static in they face
C.R.E.A.M., cash rules everything around me
King, checker board nigga go and crown me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Keep it rolled, I'm supposed to lose control
Oh no, pop the trunk, burn a skunk and slam a do', do'
Window crack on the ave, marinate the scene
When I lean and crawl couldn't see me with your high beams
Play my part, I got heart, I'm tailor gator sharp
Plus we sit taller than Monster trucks in them trailer park
My candy coated it cost a grip but I had to blow it
Your sides was dusty, my seats is bucket but you'll never know it
Forever tinted so you can't peep while your bitch up in it
You call her phone she give you tone like "Why you trippin'"
Cold blooded ain't it but that's how it be when they want that cash
When you ain't around anybody can be in that ass
Heard that from 8-Ball homeboy girlfriend
If she a bopper then she probably ain't your girl then
You claim you pimpin' don't be trickin' wear a curl then
And find some paint to put some swirls in

[Hook]

[Outro (4x)]
We goin' live
From the underground
From the underground
From the underground

[Krit and Stranger]
S: Hey, are you okay down there?
K: Yea, I'm fine. Where am I?
S: You're in the mainstream. This is A&R-ville. Where are you from?
K: I'm from Cadillactica, by way of the underground. For short, the south



[Hook: Big KRIT]
I'm going live, from the underground
From the underground

[Verse 1: Big KRIT & Ms. Linnie]
And I'm gone
Just be strong
You're not alone (You're not alone)
I'm going home (I'm going home)
Carry on (carry on)
Carry on (carry on)
Carry on (carry on)
Carry on (carry on)

[Hook: Big KRIT]

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Yea I know it's hard
This world will let you down one day (down one day)
Just let down your guard
I'll pick you up if you're 'round my way (if you're 'round my way)
Call my name
Free your chains
Call my name
Free your chains

[Bridge]
I got to get a move on

[Verse 3]
They say the train still coming, it won't be long
Only the good Lord knows my wrongs
Trouble is the damn devil won't leave me alone
No time to waste, I gotta pay my dues
Lord, my problems seem to come in twos
All these miles I walk, they can't fill my shoes

[Hook: Big KRIT & Ms. Linnie]

[Outro]
Now, this is my grandson, Justin Scott, and thank you much for listening



[Intro]
(I wish we could stay to see what happens)
We have to let them find their way, but we will create again

[Hook: Big KRIT]
Came back like the Mack, Caddy cut dime in the back
Eight track slap off the rack, I have to relapse
Po' of the fo' out the tap, break a pro back 'til it snap
She lives in my lap, eager to give up her snatch
Still on the prowl for my match
The milk and the honey, it's all about the love of the money
Space age pimp was adept, that's after the fact
Land and I make contact, destroy if they give their bomb back
Prepare for combat, peace and love still beyond that
Share the win with my comrades, that's actual fact
Odd, but they actually lack at the peak of impact
Where the soul and mind is attached
Stars will align on the map, my plan of attack
For the lost generation

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
This ain't meant to be preached on
This here meant to be teached on
I know that you ain't got much time
I promise this rhyme won't take long
You need it in your life like you need a better job
Like you need another hobby
Instead of waiting in the lobby, with the soft and the hard
Until the police holla copy, freeze
I know how it get when you ain't got shit to flush
And them balloons you bought getting bust
Cause everybody want mo' than what they really say so
You don't know who to trust
On the outside looking in of the Beamer, Bentley, Benz
Dreaming about the backseat
But you don't know what the driver had to do just to pass by you
That's if you ask me
So, shawty, don't do the dash on 'em
I hope you never crash on 'em
What good is flashin' or livin' the fastest
If you in a casket? I couldn't imagine
My mama hanging over me crying
Cause my soul is too young to let go of me
I'm saying what I gotta
Cause the club songs ain't saving my partner

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco + (Big KRIT)]
Nigga, we ain't lost
This the bitch I'm a boss generation
(For the lost generation)
Nigga, we ain't lost
This is xans got me nodding off generation
(For the lost generation)
Nigga, we ain't lost
This the puttin' candy in my cough generation
(For the lost generation)
Nigga, we ain't lost
You can find me jumping off the porch generation
(For the lost generation)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
For that, KRIT, let's kill these niggas
You got skills to help build these killers (killers)
Take the murder rate even higher (higher)
And take a nigga bitch in the process
Turn the whole thing into a contest
My nigga fuck this mic
We should be fucking with MIC
Military industrial complex
And we can get rich, nigga, fuck showing love
They ain't listening to us
They ain't playing this bitch in the club
So let's get paid, turn these motherfuckers into slaves
School is for lames, man, these niggas join gangs
Fuck Martin Luther King, nigga, fuck change
Fuck peace, I want a chain
With Jesus on the end of that bitch like BLAM!
Fuck peace, I want a plane
Fill that bitch with cocaine
And make these bitches move their booties
And help these niggas make their movies
Talk these niggas into their graves
And talk these hoes out their Coogies

[Intro]
It's now my privilege to introduce your main speaker... [clapping]
Hey, I'm Big K.R.I.T. and I'm a meditator [Hey!]
It wasn't easy to come in today, but I'm here
I just wanna meditate

[Hook]
I don't wanna hear what I've done wrong
I'll deal with my problems when I get home
I'm better off when I'm all alone
I know I said I'd stop but I'm not that strong
I just wanna meditate

[Verse One]
Said it with this glass of liquor pouring out my spiritual guidelight
Take me to the other side
Who ever said escaping your problems with empty bottles
Would only delay them til tomorrow? Yes was surely right
When the world said fuck ya, how would you reply?
No need to whisper how you feel, this is you and I
I paint pictures of hieroglyphics compared to most rap niggas
But I be over looked, so I just let it slide, let it die, how can I
Be so stupid to tell you this wasn't real
Be so eager to tell ya just how I feel
But lets be honest, the real reason I'm here
To be clear I was never the man of steel
I fell victim too many times to count
Too many times I've died, too many things I doubt
Not enough love in my house, my house is not enough
It's filled with pointless things and those things keep piling up
Those things'll leave you crushed if they fall
To be real I don't think you feel me at all
Can you hear me at all? can you steer me at all? ...to the liquor store

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
How can I stop, when I'm too far gone
To get back where I came from
I was searching for some answers at a bar with some dancers
And I found out there really ain't none
And the bottom of my glass is just as empty as my last
Encounter with my friends and my loved ones
All my ex's hate my guts, cuz when I finally call them up
They know that I just wanna fuck some
I apologize, for what? I don't know
Too many times I did it and it shows, I feel it in my soul
There's a burning in my stomach and it's churning in slow
And it grows every time I hit a low
If you high I was hoping we could roll
If you fiending for a drink, let me pour
If you riding maybe we can go
Before they close - to the liquor store

[Hook]

[Outro]
So I sit here, and I think back on all the things I wanted in life and all the things that I've accomplished
I'm more fulfilled then I ever have been before
I still lose - I've still lost, but I love, and I'm living
There's nothing better in this world than to be for sure
And I'm sure - I'm sure enough in what I do, and how I do it
There's a lot of people around me that believe in me
And I depend on them to see me through this - this life of mine
Lets hope this journey that we take
All these moves that we make
Are the right ones...while I meditate



[Hook:]
Riding round so clean I let the bass beat out my speakers
Searching for a freak that's geeked and bound to let me tweak Her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
M-I crooked, I was cooking up an old school
Sprinkled it with bad bitch, mixed it up with soul food
Put it on a plate with the bass and tweeters
For them haters, out here starvin', motherfucker I could feed ya
With some game, intergalactic, outer-space for brain
Chrome wheel in the water, might just get me in the summer
It look good don't it? Throw wood on it, with the golden vogue
Love potion on my mind, my pimpin' is an antidote
Cooley High, signing booming sign, knocking butters down
Crack the curb, like my ship emerged, from the underground
One more time, for them folks that know I be shinin'
Whippin' wind and reclining, pressin' diamonds
While I'm

[Hook:]
Riding round so clean I let the bass beat out my speakers
Searching for a freak that's geeked and bound to let me tweak Her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind , her mind

[Verse 2: E-40]
I got armorall on my tongue, I talk slick
Catch a chick without using my hands, master manip
Sliding in my SLAB, slapping Big KRIT
Woofers in the back, tweeters in the lip
Push button secret stash spot for my yammer
Yammer mean yissle, pistol, or hammer
Blowing veggies, broccoli in the air
That's that Cali weed, I know that smell anywhere
Mind control, get in the female's head like a Tylenol
Body and soul, be about your brinead, increase your bankroll
Drink and cheefin', my and my heathens bustin' power moves
In the hood, like a mechanic, stickin' to the rules

[Hook:]
Riding round so clean I let the bass beat out my speakers
Searching for a freak that's geeked and bound to let me tweak Her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind , her mind

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
On a mission, just me and Vincent
Your bitch might just come up missin' like the roof
Known to talk that player shit mama, that's just how I do
My old school look powder blue
We pulled up to the Papadeaux poundin'
Sat down, ordered the clam chowder
I had the lobster bisque
I'm what they talkin' 'bout if the topic is
Money, clothes, hoes, weed smoke
Take your panties off, you don't need those
Real niggas stay stuck to the G code
Never cheat, never off my feet
Never let these niggas see your weakness
If I eat then my niggas eat
Hit the weed then we hit the sheets
That be our little secret

[Bridge: x2]
Round and round we go
Unlock and unload
I'll remote control
Her mind, her mind
Round and round we go
Unlock and unload
I'll remote control
Her mind, her mind

[Hook:]
Riding round so clean I let the bass beat out my speakers

[Hook]
She motherfuckin' nasty
She do her mothafuckin' thang
That monkey tighter than a hamstring
Campaign to break her off proper
She never had dick that left her ass asthmatic broken in half, shit
That pussy leave a mess
Squirtin' on my polo sheets, I got an extra set
Just in case I have to break her walls
Motorboat her pearly toe until it overflows like a broken stall
Gimme head, gimme head, don't be scared, ho!
I heard its good for your skin, what you scared for?!
If you want it that deep, prop your leg more
If you ain't want it this deep, what you beg for? Ho!

[Bridge]
Let me fuck your brains out, baby!
Let me fuck your brains out, dont be scared

[Pre-Chorus: Joi]
You told 'em you was brought up
Underneath my umbrella
I was the one that taught ya
Together means we'll be forever
I see you moved to Georgia
Oh, I see you moved to Georgia
On your way to L.A

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T. + Joi]
We got a love and hate relationship, I know (I know)
But I'll keep you on my mind, no matter where I go (I go)
We got a love and hate relationship, I know (I know)
But I'll keep you on my mind, no matter where I go (I go)

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
I had to be out
'Cause we've been cool since grasshoppers and there's no doubt
Can't chill out on the post, so please don't say that we not
The type that have to move on
Since the King up and died, and the Blues gone
So, I'mma skip my feet and up my fee and make some moves
Long as I hit the road, and break the mold, I never lose
I don't do this just for self, I do this all for you
Yo mama', daddy, sister, brother and ya' cousin too
And all them country folks who never settled fo'
That average shit they throw us out on the daily
I know we better though, I watched award shows
I swear they haven't talked about us outchea' lately
Unless it's negative or irrelevant
But I never ever ever let it phase me
I keep you on my mind and you in my heart
You know that everything you are made me

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
I'm sorry that I left you but I had to
You can be sour all you want but we'll have you
Sweetened on the low, we've been bitter and it shows
Perhaps if the willow stop weepin', it'll grow
But I guess we'll never know
I just keep puttin' on it, Southern tonin'
Heard through the grapevine and a couple songs
Some of yo' fam hatin' on me, I'm never home, I know you lonely
Even if the sun shinin', it's still stormin'
I know they left us on the dock and kept goin'
I know you think I might go and do the same
I can promise I do the job and come back again
When my casket drops
I love you for the cool off and the cast is not
Why wouldn't you cheer me on if I had the shot?
I thought you wanted what's best for me so how could you ask me to stop?
Darling

[Pre-Chorus: Joi]
You told 'em you was brought up

We got history (history)
And I know that means a lot (and I know that means a lot)
But, you got skeletons in your closet (skeletons in your closet)
And they're piled up to the top (piled up to the top)
We got jealous love (jealous love)
And I know that causes pain (I know that causes pain)
But the sun don't shine the same (sun don't shine the same)
And those teardrops fall like rain (teardrops fall like rain)
On my country head (on my country head)
When I'm tryna be on my own (trying to be on my own)
You might think I fled
But right now I can't come back home (I can't come back home)
I know what I said
That I'll never ever leave you alone (I'll never ever leave you alone)
But I need you to give me time
To bring back all this shine (all this shine)
Hold on

[Intro]
Yeah, I'm sorry

[Chorus]
Uhh, I got a whole lotta, mixed messages
In my songs, am I wrong to feel this way?
I got a whole lotta, mixed messages
In my songs, am I wrong to feel this way?
Revolutionary, although I'm free
I got me a lover, but I still wanna cheat
I wanna be safe, but it's fuck the police
Don't wanna be here, but I'm too scared to leave
I got a whole lotta, mixed messages
In my songs, am I wrong to feel this way?
I got a whole lotta, mixed messages
In my songs, am I wrong to feel this way?
Revolutionary, although I'm free
I got me a lover, but I still wanna cheat
I wanna be safe, but it's fuck the police
Don't wanna be here, but I'm too scared to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Said I'm too scared to leave, I got a whole lotta—
I'm too scared to leave, I got a whole lotta mixed messages
I'm too scared to leave
Yeah, yeah (I got a whole lotta—)
Yeah (I got a whole lotta—)

[Verse]
Uhh, I love her and I hate her at the same time
I'm wack and I'm dope in the same rhyme
I'm dull but I'm gloss in the same shine
It's confusing on a sunny day
I never really liked all the fake shit
But I'm attracted to the fake ass and fake tits
That's why I made a song like original
To remind me of what fake is
I wanna be rich, but I'm givin' back
I love her like none other but don't get attached
Screamin', "Peace over beats," but I grab a strap
I help you make a meal but I got a cap
It's still fuck you, but I'll give you dap
I really wanna sing but I better rap
God on my line after all, but I ain't pick up when he called
Matter of fact, I ain't pick up at all, cause my bills paid now
Said my grace now, my light is still on, so why would I pray now?
Home is the best place for me, so why would I stay now?
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, but I never could (lay down!)
I only got a gun to protect myself
The AK make a nigga shake down
I love social network for music
But the negativity'll make you break down, like damn

[Bridge]
(I got a whole lotta, I got a whole lotta)
(I got a whole lotta, I got a whole lotta)
Uhh (I got a whole lotta—)

[Chorus]
—mixed messages
In my songs, am I wrong to feel this way?
I got a whole lotta, mixed messages
In my songs, am I wrong to feel this way? (am I wrong?)
Revolutionary (revolutionary) although I'm free (though I'm free)
I got me a lover (got me a lover) but I still wanna cheat (still wanna cheat)
I wanna be safe (wanna be safe) but it's fuck the police (fuck the police)
Don't wanna be here (don't wanna be here) but I'm too scared to leave
(Too scared to leave) I got a whole lotta, mixed messages
In my songs, am I wrong to feel this way? (am I wrong?)
I got a whole lotta, mixed messages
In my songs, am I wrong to feel this way? (am I wrong?)
Revolutionary (revolutionary) although I'm free (though I'm free)
I got me a lover (got me a lover) but I still wanna cheat (still wanna cheat)
I wanna be safe (wanna be safe) but it's fuck the police (fuck the police)
Don't wanna be here (don't wanna be here) but I'm too scared to leave

[Post-Chorus]
(Too scared to leave) I got a whole lotta—
(I'm too scared to leave, I'm too scared to leave)
I got a whole lotta mixed messages
(I'm too scared to leave, I'm too scared to leave)
(I'm too scared to leave, I'm too scared to leave)



[Bridge:]
Glisten like the sun off the candy
Got the tool in the dash, keep it handy
Jammin', up and down the boulevard, swang
Trunk still bangin', screens still hangin'
Old habits die hard, ain't shit changed
Bumping, still reclined, still swang and bang
Grippin' wood grain, grippin' wood grain

[Hook: Devin The Dude]
I remember when I used to roll
A bucket, no ducat to my name and my soul
Hoes used to front everywhere I go
But that's cool
Yea shit changed cause we on
Now I'm tailor made, choppin' blades and I'm grown
Now the same hoes won't leave me alone
But that's cool

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
So now usually I don't boast or brag
But, today different
Went from bucket, brake scrappin', to swinging like Kenny Griffey
I was scrawny than a motherfucker
When I was younger, got my weight up like a juggernaut
Now I'm solid wit' these numbers
Maxin' out on these hoes,Marinated my pimpin'
Cause when you season they peepin'
And scrape it right out the skillet
Got a vision for vixens, drop it low like the bass
Her pussy tighter than pliers that squeeze the wine outta grapes
So I hit it slow
Flea flicker, give and go
I know that the shine the only reason she kick it for
I went from not a thing, to a Caddy frame, throw it off in the game
When you came and you got changed, shit can't be the same
So I'm chillin', bumpin', grillin'
Hollin' out fuck the feeling's of critics
That claim they come from slums but they from the village for real
Cause while these lames sittin' still
I hit the road, broke the mold, and came up on a mil
BITCH!

[Hook: Devin The Dude]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Man I'm a wild motherfucker, back when I was round 20
Fuck niggas nah you wouldn't find me round any
Rollin' one deep in the Buick Park Ave
With a sawed off shotgun that cut your ass in half
Laughin' at these niggas that was hatin' on the low
Cause on the cool, I was puttin' dick off in they ho
And on the cut, you couldn't short stop me for the blow
Cause I be with the pistol, knockin' on your front door
See where I come from, you can't just tell me that you hard
Niggas'll come and box you up in your front yard
Betta' to not talk about pullin' out the GAT
Cause on sight we put that 9 milli to yah' hat
Now as I got older, my rep got colder
These niggas wouldn't dare to knock the chip up off my shoulder
Certified soldier with the stripes that'll prove it
I got my reputation in the streets, fuck the music

[Hook: Devin The Dude]

[Verse 3: Big Sant]
Yea! Reporting live from the ceiling, enjoy the view bitch
Sho' gone make a killin', ain't nothin' new bitch
Cept' the pressure from the  hecklers checkin' from the nosebleeds
Ho please, I can't even see you from my flo' seats
The boy came to play and no this ain't a game
Dunkin', trunkin, thumpin' purple colored gators mayne
Hold up, this win is on us
It's a celebration, bitch, every time I show up
Get in the way, get swole up
That's no luck for anyone tryna outshine us
Plenty of haters that couldn't get haters are heard steppin' behind us
Better catch on to our coattails, I boast well, while I shit talk
That bullshit we don't let walk
Cripple their chances, cripple advances, stickin' the landin'
Then I, jumped up off the porch wit'
All of this dough that I'm gone get
Respect that or get yo' dome split
And on it I stay, no reprieve for no punk
Consider your ship sunk, I'm just bein' Big Sant bitch

[Bridge:]



[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Is it me or is it something about a car
That makes a bad bitch get freaky fuck like porno stars?
Or maybe it was that chrome that keep a bopper in the zone
But either way she hit my phone like she can't leave me lone
And that there just keeps happening, blame it on all this rapping shit
10 out of 10 she down to fuck, that's just what my average is
Slab and chassis lavishly, wood cabin, digi-dash in it I'm an advocate
Chromed out wheels if you hop in here you might jet lag a bit
I'm passionate about everything that I want, I do what it do and y'all don't
I put the whole world in my trunk, let it bump
Check the stars out when I ride, dodgin' potholes with these tires
Hogging lanes, swang and bang in a 'Stang so let me by
Cuz I got --

[Hook: Big KRIT]
Money on the floor
Lighters on the dresser
Drop my top, no one can do it better
Diamonds and the leather
Wood and the chrome
Bopping ass hoes just won't leave me alone

[Verse 2: 8-Ball]
She call me big baby, I got my Guccis on
Black on black, head to toe, smelling like Prada cologne
Feeling like big pimping, inhale, exhale
Good green, thick lean, give them bitches x pills
Cocaine make them get so loose on them tequila shots
Every time I do it I regret it, the bitch just can't stop
Now she's dancing on the table, skirt done went up to her navel
Niggas throwing money at her, shit I can't be mad at her

[Verse 3: MJG]
You bring the girl to me then I'mma bless her, test her
25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
My bitch on the block with some money on her mind
A pistol in her purse and a heart full of grind
I'm pimp type, MJ, drop my top, light that dro
Hand on the wood with the pedal on the floor
Forever get dough and I’m clever on the ho
Still get vetted man, never be a scary man
My DNA is all Ike Turner, Eddie King

[Hook]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
25 lighters, 25 cyphers
Went to jail and shared a cell with a 25-to-lifer
Stayed at my grandma house with 25 bibles
Stayed in the trap house with like 25 rifles
Drop my top and I dip dip dip
But if I pop my trunk you better duck, don't slip
Chrome lips on the vehicle look like they blowing kisses
Reel them hoes in, it look like I'm going fishing
Okay this how I ride, two bad hoes inside
One ho say she ready, the other ho said she tired
I'mma drop this other ho off, me and the other ho we gon ride
All jokes aside I'm the get money poster child

[Hook]

Now they wanna hear a country nigga rap
Five albums in, I swear a country nigga snap
Thought they wanted trap, thought they wanted bass
Thought they wanted molly, thought they wanted drank
Fuck them niggas, now they wanna hear a country nigga rap
Five albums in, I swear a country nigga snap
Thought they wanted gold, thought they wanted shine
Thought they wanted radio, bitch make up your mind
(Yeah ho)

[Verse 1]
All this attention, I don't even know what I might do with it
That Control beat is like an ugly bitch that everybody done fucked raw
Maybe you hit it
Aww man, I'm more concerned why niggas been textin' my cell, callin' my phone
Ask me about this Kendrick shit, that he ain't even really even diss me on
I ain't drawn to all this propaganda, rap shit 'bout as real as Santa
Now I'm lyrical all of the sudden
Well last year they claim they ain't understand me
I'm buryin' niggas, and pissin' on they graves
Another nigga, other nigga name on your chain
And they call me a slave
Niggas scared of this country boy, lord forbid I catch a body
In the studio tryna calm your soul
Lookin' at your manager, I think Krizzle got me
I put you in the trunk with these subwoofers
5th wheel in my shottie
I'm so prolific with these scriptures they might give me a Bible
Page 1, come here son
Mind your manners, just be cool
I know you lame when you was in school
The little fame you ain't used to
And it was easy for you to move through
English class with your own thesaurus
Like one of these days I'm gonna be a rapper
But all my verses gonna be borrowed
So I'ma take from all these Southern artists
That mainstream never heard of
Recycle all of they lingo
And make sure I screw my words up
Bravo for your swagger-jackin'
I'm overwhelmed by your dedication
You actually fooled these people into thinkin'
That your music was innovative
Frustrated
Rap battlin' never got me out of no public housin'
You tellin' me I can be King of Hip-Hop
And they wouldn't give it to Andre 3000?
Nigga please, this award ain't got shit to do with us
God could physically come down and say "he the greatest
My favorite, y'all should listen, he have potential
To outlive the heatwave I'ma send through this motherfucker
And rebuild for a whole 'nother other culture"
And that wouldn't be enough
So fuck these haters and fuck these hoes
Damn right I still mean that

[Verse 2]
Hope the hook wasn't too simple
Either way nigga, I wrote it
Yes, I made the beat, yes, I mixed the track
I am far from wack, you a one-trick pony
I don't fall in line, I define what's rhyme
Fuck what you was thinkin', bloggers they can quote it
Lotta rappers buried underneath my house
They know what I'm 'bout, you ain't even know it
Overdosed on hocus-pocus, jibber-jabber
Snap on my stature was firebreathin' dragon
King of every castle, how you signin' rappers?
All these labels must be givin' out a raffle
Wranglin' like cattle, keep a nigga shackled
Leavin' people baffled, tap dance nigga
Misleadin' all of your rap fans, nigga
Might as well just do a lap dance, nigga
Sap ass nigga
Do whatever for some dap ass nigga
I ain't got time
To watch out for children, stay out my kitchen
The shit that I'm cookin' ain't meant for your kind
Crackin' and bashin' the shit out your spine
King with a crown, humble and tall
Tyrants never keep quiet, they'd rather be violent
So I'm beheading them all
The lay of the land, I'm settin' fire to buildings and bridges
You ain't sell out a show until you sell out one in Mississippi
What’s good for Hip Hop may not be good for my soul
So, I keep flexin', wreckin', for the people that respect it
Check it, fuck a Control
(Are you not entertained!)
Bih!

[Hook]
Multi, Multi
Til the motherfuckin' sun die
Til the motherfuckin' sun die
One time for Multi, Multi
Til the motherfuckin' sun die
Til the motherfuckin' sun die
One time for Multi

[Verse 1]
I did it for the people that believe in me
Never shine on my family cause that could breed envy
Friends up and turned foes and I done seen plenty
Cause loyalty is all we had and I believed in it
I can't deny that
Most don't survive rap
Cause being poor wasn't easy and we survived that
Too many times I left home and had to drive back
Cause deals fell through instead of beats, they'd rather buy a sack
Multi since 86
A lot of motherfuckers out there hated this
To see a king from the bottom
Of country bumpkin from nothing
Good Lord you know I got it right
So put your lighters in the air for me
If I'm down I pray you care for me
This for them fans everywhere for me
Thank God that they were there for me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't no secret I'd ride for it
If need be, I'll die for it
My plane could crash and burn but I'd fly for it
Fight the power raise my fist in the sky for it
I put my brothers on, divide the pie for it
Then get it popping like the 4th of July for it
You can't low ball, I want the high high for it
My Grandma died knowing that I tried for it
Many nights alone, yeah I cry for it
Seventeen, hit the road made a drive for it
Peddle CD's out the trunk break my pride for it
Apply for a job just to get denied for it
So many tries to sign but I decide for it
On the stage of life Titans still collide for it
Last song, breath gone, stage dive for it
Say goodbye, close my eyes for it

[Hook]

[Outro]
Be just and justify your actions
Breathe deep and walk up right
Lead and never follow
Love the people, be of the people
Humble yourself and pray
History remembers Kings

I still got my sub ho (ho)
I still got my sub ho (ho)

I still let my trunk knock til the tape pop
My rims chop chop while my bass knock

I done cut up my bang and shook up the stars (Nigga wut?)
(Nigga wut?) (Shook up the stars)
I done cut up my bang and shook up the stars (Nigga wut?)
(Nigga wut?) (Shook up the stars)
I done cut up my bang and shook up the stars (Nigga wut?)

[Verse 1]
Young Krizzle I'm back again
Old school and I'm backin' out
Country boy still rep that rep that
Hit the bass and I'm actin' out
On the ave with a bad bitch stackin' clouds
Show a pimp what that ass about
In the parkin' lot deep while the whole world sleep
Pourin out hennessy 'til I'm passin' out
Gotta keep my eyes open cause I heard that five scopin'
For the car with the big ass sub and the top chopped off, so I drive slowly
Fuckin' bangin' in the back wood like a lac' should with the lights bright, windows tinted
Stopped at the gas station for a bag of chips
A fountain drink and some peppermints just to freshen up
Shawty say she down to fuck
But we gotta make a move cause it's after 2
And her man is the type to bust, she frightened of em' but I ain't though
Now she wonder what she came for
But I ain't trippin' no place, I ain't even gonna flip
Over another nigga bitch, move over to the next

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
(I still got my sub ho) jammin' on that drug flow
King Kong's in my trunk, in a fight with my thump, better let my sub go
Shawty in the front seat proceed to get high as fuck
She ain't worried 'bout her man no more
Hell, he don't know how to treat his ho
That nigga never ever slam no doors
I thought I saw some light but I'm trippin'
I gotta bust this right 'fore I miss it
I hit the super 8 because it's super late and she know the way and I dig it
All in my ear, have no fear, says she wanna fuck with me
Well, I told 'er that's all good while she grip my wood but a pimp don't fuck for free
She laughed and answered her phone, I swear it's 3 in the morn'
Like who could that be, she looked at me like he won't leave me alone
Well thats a damn shame, he don't know my name and I ain't got no time wit' yo folks
Lets just get this room and do what we do and be up out this thang around 4

[Hook]

I still got my sub ho

[Outro]
KRIT: Yo Shawty, just lock my door and get out
GIRL: Alright baby, I got you
KRIT: Aye Wally, what's good boy?
GIRL: You always on your phone
KRIT: Boy, I'm at this Super 8 right across the street from where you live at boy
WALLY: Thats what it is man
KRIT: Yeah man, this shit bout to go down man, shawty bad as fuck
WALLY: Aye man, Just be careful out there man
KRIT: Yea I'm play it same man, Don't worry bout it man. For real, I got you. Aye aye hold on
JACKER: Boom, motherfucker
GIRL: I thought ya'll said ya'll wasn't gone hurt him
JACKER: Bitch, shut the fuck up
JACKER: Open the trunk. Lets get this motherfucker sub
Last night my DJ saved my life
Last night my DJ saved my life
Last night my DJ saved my life
Last night my DJ saved my life
My life, my life



[Hook]
Two fifteens, fifteens
Two fifteens, fifteens
I got two fifteens, fifteens
Two fifteens and I'm knockin' on these ho
Big bang ho, big bang ho
Big bang ho, I got two fifteens
Big bang ho, big bang ho
Big bang ho, I got two fifteens

[Verse 1]
This is how it all started way back
First the boomin' voice then the bass crack, 808
And that's when we first started fire
Cause the speakers wasn't grounded and he fried all the wires
But he thought about the thump from the jump
Took it out the bat cave and he threw it in the trunk
And that's evolution for you peeps
Like this is how I'm supposed to get freaks, 808

[Pre-Hook]
Hoes can't twerk to the high hat, never
Cranking up the knob till he broke off the lever
Subbin' on these hoes, give a fuck about the treble
He could barely feel his face but he hit 'em with the bass like

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now this is how it all started way back
Your neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor's hate that
Basin' through my city like a junkie beat
With my trunk talking to you, bitch you better speak
Pull up to the club and I kill shit
Bitch you gotta be dead not to feel this, 808
My cousin passed his Alpines to me
Like this is how you supposed to get freaks, 808

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3]
No this ain't your ordinary subwoofer
Knocking down the pictures off the wall
I keep it crackin' in my trunk
Destroy your whole hood with that thump
That's if you want it like that player
Vibrate from M-I-Crooked all the way to Himalayas
Pandora box and custom made it
It's Sonic booming; Jackson State it
My trunk knock like Jehovah Witness
I made it to where haters had to play it
It's a really good fuckin' speaker do I have to say it?
It took me a year and some change just to calibrate it

[Outro]
Ain't nobody gonna stop this sub that I got in my trunk today
Crank it to the max till the pavements  start to crack
And the fuck boy law give chase
Man hol' up I've been bassin' since bass been bass
The knob keep breaking and the swangers keep scraping
With these two fifteens wrecking shop all day
I'm bound to wake the block always
Big bang



[Hook]
My trunk pussy pop (pop)
Them hoes down to bop (bop)
My trunk pussy pop (pop)
Them hoes down to bop (bop)
My trunk pussy pop (pop)
Them hoes down to bop (bop)
My blades swing and chop (chop)
Them subwoofers knock (knock)
Show yo' grill ho

Show yo' grill ho
Show yo' grill ho
Show yo' grill ho
Show yo' grill ho

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Yeah dat me, yeah dat right
So throwed off the drank that I'm outta sight
Pushin' buttons caddy corner crushin'
Cluckin', bussas they claim they wanna fuck tonight
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Dark skinned nigga with a playa voice
Have y'all thinkin' I'm Barry White
Pop up twice I ain't trippin' on nothin'
Tires on rotation and the bass still buzzin'
Old school whip with the A/C cuttin'
Calibrate the navigation, bitch don't touch it
Hit the flo', you bet I get the flo'
I got bands to spend, you got twat to show
You can bop for gold, but I'm grain grippin'
Trunk shakin' like a stripper pole came with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
My car candy painted, my house sit on a hill
I never was a square, I always worked the wheel
Always had them boppers, ridin' on some choppas
Parking lot warfare, my trunk go blocka blocka
They way I beat the bass, wassup? might catch a case
Broke another bank and put it in they face
Ever since I rolled up with the doors on Transforma'
Four done poured up, niggas had to hate
Wheels on chrome, I had to slow my four's up
Cuz them potholes deep and I can't let them scrape
I let my tape knock, 'til my tape pop
Tell them motherfuckers that I got that bass

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
I said of course I'mma show my grill, and show my ass
I came on this earth in 87, pussy nigga check my past
Been a real nigga ever since, ride around the A with my nigga named Tay
Beatin' down them fuckin' blocks, from Conley Road to Moreland A
Nigga don't talk you ain't bout dat life
Drop top Chevy with the Bow Tie pipes
Let that Chevy breathe on em
When you pull up to that light
Hit the gas and watch that Chevy pop an ollie
Half these young niggas on rims
But my Chevy sit on rallys

[Hook]



[Intro]
See Me on Top, Volume 4, Shawty
Cadillactica, coming soon
November, pimpin', it's going down

[Hook]
I'm never going back
To that broke shit
9 to 5, getting by, being po' shit
I'm never going back
Pockets low shit
To all the mothafuckas out here on that ho shit
I'm never going back
To bumming rides
Taking chances, riding dirty to survive
I'm never going back (x3)

[Verse 1]

Only lord knows
To a pocket full of lint and bullshit clothes
One bill away from being in the suit line
Yeah, my nigga got jammed, but I'm gonna get mine
Damn, my nigga got kids, I gotta help out
If I don't fight for my spot, then I'm left out, stressed out
Hoping God can throw a good son a blessing
Cause going two days without eating just ain't healthy
Sitting in this four corner room, consuming all my doubts
Eviction notice been due, they bound to kick us out
Cop a room for the night, deep off in the drought
I'm too grown to be on grandma's couch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Where they left me at?
Out here for the wolves
When you hustle just to scrape for change, hard to play it cool
Now it's Louis loafers, all on your sofa, like, 'fuck this couch'
Went from crinkled dollars to banding benjis and large amounts
Let's say[?], pray over this cake we cutting
Been on my grown man shit since ladies [?]
I rest on a cot, they see a lock[?]
I touch down in every spot
It takes a vacay just to shop
She bougie, only seen the type of shit in the movie
Live the type of life you wish that you knew me
Grew up rocking Gibraltar[?], white tees, bubble toes, and Pumas
Now it's [deadstock] stock[motherfucker]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

To folding clothes, at clothing stores, for $5.84[?]
To pay bills and work some more on the daily
Na, baby, no party for my b-day
I'm sorry I can't be there
I'm out here chasing payment
Lately my heart been aching
I feel like I should do better
The world we in gets colder and colder
Go get my sweater and bundle up
Summer just ain't warm enough to heat the souls of many
I'm out here scraping pennies
Pray the crooked law don't sentence me to death
With my hands up, hard to pull my pants up
Running for dear life while I'm jammed up
Slammed and mishandled 'em
Police there[?]
[?] cameras while media Wikipedia me to be a vandal
Memories of energy flow through my burned candles
On the corner 'till the wind blow
I wrote that bar for all my dope selling kin folk
Risk taking everyday
I pray that y'all settle down, get married, find a wife, then throw a bouquet, have kids, and be safe
And teach 'em what our parents didn't teach us
The music just don't reach 'em like it reach us
So now it's on us to be the leaders
Cause we never going back

[Outro]

As long as you felt it, and it touched your soul
That's king me [?]

[Hook: Big KRIT]
Bitch I got a new agenda
Grippin' grain ‘till I catch a splinter
Stripper pole, set it in the middle
For them bust it’s, down to twerk a little
B-b-b-b-b-bitch I got a new agenda
Time and time again
And time and time and time again
I tried to tell these hoes
Time and time again
And time and time and time again
I tried to tell these hoes
Bitch I got a new agenda

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Doin' two a days in my Cadillac
Flex around me, I might take your bitch and not give her back
Nigga cutthroat, nigga cutthroat, nigga cutthroat
He ain’t give you money to give to me bitch? Then what you fuck for?
Ducked off in that corner store
Yeah I got some gators but I need some more
‘Dem white wall, ‘dem white wall, they was super cold
Since a grasshopper all I ever wanted was some triple golds
‘Dem Daytons and that my bass boss
John Travolta, these subwoofers might blow your face off
Take your cape off, super sippin', settle down
And let me tippy-tize, I just wanna rhyme

[Hook: Big KRIT]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Gold teeth on my pitbull your bitch bringin' me breakfast
Just got me two coupes, them hoes Jeremy Shepherds
Hatin' niggas so petty, all I chase is that lettuce
Top down on my fitted, Pittsburgh like Bettis
Smilin' like I’m William "The Refrigerator" Perry
6 mill' for the condo that extra 2 for that terrace
All I want is that lemon pepper, but the flavors vary
Got head in Paris, my AP canaries
See me on that cover of Rolling Stone's embellished
Diamonds drip from my neck, them tats all on my belly
All I had was that dream, Martin Luther my king
And one last request: bury me in my rings

[Hook: Big Krit]

[Outro: Big KRIT]
Pardon if it’s much
Diamonds in the back seat will surely crush
Fishbone the dash, roll around on glass
You talkin' too much
Takes a lot of shine just to Supernova
You don’t know my kind
I don’t play with kids, bitch I play for keeps
If you don’t know I’m with it then you don’t know the shine
Take that with a grain of salt, I don’t give a fuck about it
Treat the pussy the gold if she down
Then swoll, then she bound to squeeze a buck up out it
Hard protective plate of a suplex, the way I flex on a broke ho
It ain’t what I asked for? It’s a no no
Bitch I got a new agenda

No static when it's cool
No static when you got a lotta crew
And you're always on the go
Gettin' to it like you're supposed
No static when it's chill
No static when you kinda got a feel
For somethin' on the real
Livin' life for what it is

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Today might be a good day, feel it in my bones
The sun shine, she make the flicker from off the chrome of the wheel
What good is the bass if you don't hear
Them tweets got to be clear as glass
Brush my teeth and wash my ass
Prep my beard, press my clothes, soap, water, rags
Can't be busted with these Jordans
Krit spend a lot you can't afford
So I'm Moonwalkin' out the crib, flex
Lint rollin perpetrators and boppers off my fad
Crank the whip once, pressed, gas slammed
I got an automatic

[Hook: Warren G]
No static when it's cool

Livin' life for what it is

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Now propose I break 'em off somethin' proper
I got more colors in my paint than Cyndi Lauper
Radio take check, I get my partner on the phone
Like 'what's on deck?', shawty bet that up, set that up
Cool, just hit me when the drink fall through
I got a couple darlin' nicki's just for the crew
Talkin' 'bout, there's some single chicks to mingle wit' and smash
They ain't the clingy type, they only here for fashion
The camera flashin', they smokin', drinkin', put some cash in
One of them classy, I peeped her ass through her khakis
I told her that my mouth piece everlasting
Then I got her automatic

[Hook: Warren G]
No static when it's cool

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Domino's slammin', five deuce four tray
And sticky icky, rollin' liquor, flowin' niggas ain't playin'
No static, no static mothafucka
No static, no static mothafucka
Slip and slide up and down the boulevard
Creepin' when you do it like I does it when we buzzin', no sleepin'
No static, no static mothafucka
No static, no static mothafucka
Got the radar on checking for the laws, we ain't trippin
If the neighbors call, tell us keep it down we ain't listenin'
No static, no static mothafucka
No static, no static, got an automatic

[Hook: Warren G]

[Hook]
You thought you were the only one ballin'
You thought you were the only one slabbed out
You thought you were the only pimpin'
In the V.I with the broads and they ass out
You thought you were the only one...
Naww playa..
You thought you were the only one...
Naww playa..

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Now I apply pressure, yessuh, gold on my dresser
Effortlessly perfected this pimpin' to the neck up
And with it, I can dress up, any pro into a pretzel
Figure 'fore she figure more dick might destroy her vessel
Mo'-mo'-most not the lesser, it's how I judge my worth
Cuz the last time I tripped ova pussy was probably at my birth
And the last time I didn't pop my trunk was probably at my church
But as soon as I left the parking lot, I maxed it out till it burst
Wood grain in my wheel, princess cut in my grill
Butter fly my steak, shrimp and lobster on chill
Do it how I feel, cuz doin' what you love won't hurt ya
Plus an L7 could never understand the complexity of my circle
Or the dynamics of a twerker, or the inner workings of a squirter
Its like chemistry with this codeine, two parts cup one purple
3 more time that's charm, bad bitch on my arm
Come and go as I please, whole world in my palm

Hook:1x

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Chocolate-chip cookies on my tray
True stoner I get high just as sure as the sun come up to light up the day
A real boss up in the game don’t have to pay to play
We burnin’ down come smoke a pound I’m just a flight away
I earned the right to say I’m rich off what I write today
And stickin’ to my cheese like a microwave
Broke niggas they don’t like us they don’t wanna fight
Shout out to Max cuz you could never ride the wave but me I got the title
OG kush in my joint, Ooo, all my niggas on point, Ooo
Ride around reppin’ that gang, T.G.O.D. come join
You niggas do a show there and don’t get no love
I sell a hundred thousand tickets when I show up
They say the game done changed
Well that mean, you need to change too
And stop with all that fuckin’ hatin
Cuz that’s what motherfuckin’ lames do

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
Rightt
You ain't the only nigga gettin’ money got it down to a science
Big nigga, bank teller, think I play for the Giants
Dead fresh, walk by and get a moment of silence
Don’t be mad because we livin’ dog, be mad at the Mayans
Riding deciding live maine or peeking
Who said hustlers can’t be king
Wrists got crowns on 'em bad hoes is beasting mista
Slide the first day, instant upgrade
Thompson my jacket, Black Label my denims
Very rare my kicks, this petty cash that I’m spendin’
With the rich folks bout to blend in
Got a obsession for this game Bob Lemon
Gangsta, hustla, shit I bleed it, keep these niggas heated
I don’t do reservations I walk in and get seated
Best believe it this harlem kids the meanest
Trippy stickin’ at the table smell the smoke but they don’t see it

[Hook x1]



[Hook: Big KRIT]
Lord let us party tonight
Cause tomorrow don't mean that we ball
Lord let us party tonight
Cause tomorrow they might kill us all
So we drink, and we smoke
Cause our problems won't let us go
We rolled around, head in the clouds
Living life the best that we know
Singing Lord let us party tonight

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I just wanna see my friends in big body Benzes
Pay they bills and feed they kids
On occasion, we hit the club or go vacation
In places we never seen, that'd be amazing
We all dreamers not petty schemers, although you think
Know you racist, know you hate me
You too anxious to up and shoot me
That shit so stupid, look how they do me
This my last night, come and scoop me, singing

[Hook: Big KRIT]
Lord let us party tonight
Cause tomorrow don't mean that we ball
Lord let us party tonight
Cause tomorrow they might kill us all
So we drink, and we smoke
Cause our problems won't let us go
We rolled around, head in the clouds
Living life the best that we know
Singing Lord let us party tonight

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
I just wanna celebrate in the back we made it
To the 'burbs
From the pavement
Ain't no placements for congragations
When you cool, but you you blazin'
Out on the corner
Not marijuana
Glock with no safety
Catching cases
Bullet strays
Killed a kid the other day
Why you shooting? That shit so stupid
Can't own the block or the stoop
And you gain the world just to lose it
I feel your struggle
Pops a hustler, ain't never hug ya
Mama say it like you daddy
She couldn't love ya
Its fucked up
When you moving but steady losing
Before you lose it put down tool
I'ma scoop you, singing

[Hook: Big KRIT]
Lord let us party tonight
Cause tomorrow don't mean that we ball
Lord let us party tonight
Cause tomorrow they might kill us all
So we drink, and we smoke
Cause our problems won't let us go
We rolled around, head in the clouds
Living life the best that we know
Singing Lord let us party tonight

[Outro: Big Krit] x2
Its our party and we fly if we want to
Higher than the pain that we go through
Celebrate the life that we might lose
If I don't see you again

[Intro: Rico Love]
Came in with all this money
I know that they all want it
But you're the one who gets it
Should've paid more attention
I should be paying more attention to you
I should be paying more attention to you
I should be paying more attention to you
I should be paying more attention to you

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Shit, smoke and mirrors, dollar bills
Flexin' for no reason, get it how you live
Crack a seal, bottle poppin' on another level
Red light special, she ain't selfish, workin' with no discretion
Twistin', turnin', my mind blown and her mind gone
She slow rollin', ain't no ho in her time zone
Face right, stage lights turn her out
Act like she the only one in here
That can twerk for real and that's without a doubt
Like damn, DJ, run that back
I think that was her song, and she don't know how to act
Like damn, all night I been with it
All night she been gettin' it, all night she been winnin'

[Hook: Rico Love & Big K.R.I.T.]
I should be paying more attention to you (I should be paying attention to you)
All this money being thrown, all these lights shinin'
I should be paying more attention to you
I should be paying more attention to you (I should be paying attention to you)
Don't none of that shit outshine you
I should be paying more attention to you
Ya already know, let go
I should be paying more attention to you (I should be paying attention to you)
Toot it up, turn ya out, show out when you show up
I should be paying more attention to you
Show out when you show up, show out when you show up
I should be paying more attention to you (I should be paying attention to you)
Toot it up, turn ya out, show out when you show up
Show out when you show up, show out when you show up

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T. & Rico Love]
Came in with all this money
And everybody know it, chain still glowin'
Kick it with my folk that ain't been here before
Thought I seen everything I can see on the low
Wish I seen from the door that you the best of the best
Make a broke motherfucker thumb through a check
I ain't really trippin' on ya homegirl, she was in her own world
Shawty, I'm just hopin' you next
To show up and show out
Ya make it hard for me just to roll up and roll out
To be honest
You the type of chick a nigga search for when he have to go out
Spotlight, night life, live in V.I. every weekend
I ain't trippin' on a busta that really ain't nothin'
I'm hopin' you down for the creepin'
Like damn, super throwed, kill the pole
The whole club had to show you love
The way you toot it up and get it off the floor
Like damn, tell me you know you the greatest
Ain't a chick in the VIP that can shine like this
Baby girl, you know you made it

[Hook: Rico Love & Big K.R.I.T.]
I should be paying more attention to you (I should be paying attention to you)
All this money being thrown, all these lights shinin'
I should be paying more attention to you
I should be paying more attention to you (I should be paying attention to you)
Don't none of that shit outshine you
I should be paying more attention to you
Ya already know, let go
I should be paying more attention to you (I should be paying attention to you)
Toot it up, turn ya out, show out when you show up
I should be paying more attention to you
Show out when you show up, show out when you show up
I should be paying more attention to you (I should be paying attention to you)
Toot it up, turn ya out, show out when you show up
Show out when you show up, show out when you show up

[Bridge: Rico Love & Big K.R.I.T.]
Came in with all this money
I ain't trippin' on this shit I got right here
I know that they all want it
Just tryna make it happen in the club, ya feel me?
But you're the one who gets it
But you the baddest chick in this motherfucker
Should've paid more attention
I was slippin' but I'm here now, what happening?
I should be paying more attention to you (let go)
I should be paying more attention to you (let go)
I should be paying more attention to you (let go)
I should be paying more attention to you (let go)

[Outro: Big K.R.I.T. & Rico Love]
Toot it up, turn ya out, show out when you show up
Show out when you show up, show out when you show up
Toot it up, turn ya out, show out when you show up
Show out when you show up, show out when you show up
I should be paying more attention to you (I should be paying attention to you)
I should be paying more attention to you
I should be paying more attention to you (I should be paying attention to you)
I should be paying more attention to you
I should be paying more attention to you
I should be paying more attention to you
I should be paying more attention to you
I should be paying more attention to you

I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, I put the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my name
You 'bout that - 'bout that, then it ain't no thing
I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, nigga, the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my crown
If she 'bout that pole she keep it going around and around

[Verse 1]
I put that piece on chain, it cost me a grip
If rapping is acrobatics, I'm making it flip
Fuck what you heard, fuck on the curb
It shine like a light
If hoes don't start emerging you ain't doing it right
You just new to the game, you ain't been in the field
I was sharpening mine, tryna' go for the kill
Tryna' get me a mill, fly a private Alliance
Tell 'em 'probably never land, keep it going 'round and around
Highly anticipated, I'm on it and motivated
Told 'em it ain't nothing to claim and it's complicated
Sitting on Mount Olympus, sending out smoke signals
Word to my unborn, niggas ain't fucking with us
Since I was in Granny's kitchen I knew I'd get grater later
Fast-forward ten years, my crib need an elevator
Krizzle, back in time, swangin' and coming down
Motherfuck stand still
Going round and around

[Hook]
I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, I put the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my name
You 'bout that - 'bout that, then it ain't no thing
I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, nigga, the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my crown
If she 'bout that pole she keep it going around and around

[Verse 2]
I put the piece on chain, the whip on swang
I'm fuck all them busty bitches that fuck with a king
I saw it all from the rooftop, condo clockin' figures
Fingers is swollen, my wrist has been fucking with me
I whip-whip on it, muddy water - sip on it
She gon' suck the soul out me if I put the tip on it
I throw on a rubber, dive under covers and go to town
Can't fuck it raw, that pussy going round and a round
Stay off and play em all, my flexes been activated
Moving at top speed, haters is hesitating
All about power plays, scoring to make a move
Call up an audible, we lift them laws and come through
Gotta be realistic, I stack it and make it work
It ain't worth getting if you don't get it right out the dirt
They heard that I'm back in time, trunk knocking underground
Rotating deuce twice
Going round and around

[Hook]
I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, I put the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my name
You 'bout that - 'bout that, then it ain't no thing
I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, nigga, the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my crown
If she 'bout that pole she keep it going around and around



[Intro]
Yeah
Baby leave the porchlight on
Baby leave the porchlight on
Baby leave the porchlight on
I can feel your pain through the phone
I promise not to stay too long
So leave the porchlight on

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I gotta get it while the gettin' good, get outside the hood
I’m tired of the landlord tripping on us
My partner said he gotta play, heard it worked the other day
I’ve been home late because I'm bendin' corners
Don’t worry, hit me via text, ain’t no need to stress
Gotta make some moves, I hate to leave you home lonely
I know just how it be when you in between the sheets
While I’m in the streets thinking need to be at home
Lord knows i'm outchea on the grind nigga
When I'm on the shine ain't no telling when I'm coming home
Remember that you said that pussy mine
Anytime you’d meet at the door with no panties on
And don’t be mad, playing hard to get
Cuz you could cum ‘til your heart content
Yea, I can feel your pain through the phone
I promise not to stay too long so leave the porchlight on

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton & Big KRIT]
I'm coming home, baby it won't be long
I know you lookin’ fine, slide up behind ya
Say something good to you (something good to you)
It won’t be long (baby leave the porchlight on)
I'm coming home, coming home nice and strong
I wanna see them eyes when I surprise ya
I promise I won’t stay too long so leave the porchlight on

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Back out on the road again
Different city, in the studio, working on the flow again
I really wanna talk on the phone
Shorty I gotta finish this song, it won’t be long
Until we presidential suite, vaca'ing on the beach
Waikikiing for a week
Diamond in the back, leather on the seats
Louie on your frame, red bottoms on your feet
I mean the money can’t change how you feel right now
Even harder cuz you bother once the sun goes down
Wonder where I’m going after shows and such
Don’t be listening to your friends cuz they talk too much
Think I know just what we goin’ through, to make it right
I pray you understand this ain’t over night
I’ll be on the next flight on my way back home
I promise I won’t stay too long so leave the porchlight on

[Hook]

[Interlude: Anthony Hamilton & Big KRIT]
I won’t take too long baby
I’m on my way baby (baby leave the porchlight on)
Comin’ home
I wanna love you girl (baby leave the porchlight on)
You know I’m on my way (baby leave the porchlight on)
I can’t stay away too long

[Hook]

[Outro]
I won’t wait too long baby
Why don’t you go on and flip that light on?
I wanna see me steppin’ up to the door when I’m gettin’ closer, closer baby yea



[Hook: BB King]
Guess I was on the road
Didn't know which way to go
I think I hear a praying man coming
A praying man coming
Sometimes I couldn't read the signs
My people done left me behind
I think I hear a praying man coming
I think I hear a praying man coming

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Stumble along the path, he emerged from the grass
Stopped at me and asked why so sad
Perhaps because they had taken what I had
I'm sure it wasn't much to them but it was all that I could grab
I was on my way to church, I was running late at first
But after all this riff raff here, I missed service and it hurts
But what's worse I'm not sure how long I've been swaying in the breeze
Tired of talking to the trees and you the first praying man that I've seen
I figured you'd lend a hand, but I see if you got some time
I'm glad you looked up because most people pay no mind
He smiled and said "Son well, I can do you one better"
He removed a pocket knife and cut me down from my oppressor, forever

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Krit]
Boating along the sea, he emerged from the mist
Asked me how I got far from the beach
Cause they stripped me of my pride and put these shackles on my feet
I was stacked on top of my folk and it was really hard to breathe
It was a little hard to believe that I had been caught up in this mess
And some of my own people would sell me to my death
It was a lot of us on the ride and it was a lot of us that was lost
But some of us couldn't take it so some of us jumped off
And I'm really glad you found me on your course
I been out here for a while and there's no sign of the shore
He smiled and said "Son well I can do you one better"
He lended me his hand and picked me up from my oppressor, forever

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Driving along the road
He asked me what I was running from and where I was trying to go
"Well I was working in the field and one of my kinfolk just got killed
And I knew they'd come for me and Lord knows I wanna live
See I heard there's people free, not that far but far from me
To be running from these dogs with no shoes up on my feet
I heard of this railroad that ventures underground
And takes my kind of people to a place that we can't be found
And I been wounded for some miles, so I decided to rest my head
I guess they let me go cause they assumed that I was dead"
Smiled and said “Son hop in this wagon and get settled”
He offered me a ride and drove me far away from my oppressor, forever

[Hook]



[Chorus]
Paparazzi after my shows askin' me questions
God fed up with my soul so ain't no blessin's
Happiness can't be bought or sold, I learned my lesson
Now I see what fame will really get you;
Bottle by the nightstand, that ease the stresses
Dealin' with depression, pills on the dresser
Fiendin' for affection so I'm buying out the section
Now I see what fame will really get you

[Verse 1]
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
That lifestyle left a lot of rich folk brainless
To the temple, yeah we were broke but that life was simple
Besides, food is food, water is water, air is air, the rest is mental
I did without until I did within
I said on beat what I wrote in pen
I gave my all without givin' in
But it's a thin line between heavenly divine and a livin' a life of sin
Speak in codes to my worthy friends
Greenroom full, I pray we ain't let the devil in
A lot of faces I don't know, a lot of "where you been's?"
Like you was really lookin' for me when I was in the wind
Life is just a game now, I really got my aim down to shoot for stars
I ain't been to church in years and it ain't even far
This ain't even half of the battle, I ain't even start
All I do is record, I see what fame will really get you

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah (this ain't even half of the battle, I ain't even start)
All I do is record, I see what fame really will get you
Now I see what fame really get you
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I bought a bottle just to soothe my soul
Still crying over granny, that was some years ago
I'm a man now, I came up to hold my fam down
Can't tell them about my depression 'cause most them fans now
Got to protect myself at all times
I know some partners that been sued by their bloodline
Lord forbid I let my blood down
The first time I say no, guess we ain't blood now
Scared, me as a businessman is like all they see
Justin Scott trapped as Big K.R.I.T. screamin', "It's really me"
When it was only us it was only love, how could this be?
When fallin' out for some is not gettin' the V.I.P
And a simple conversation means we talkin' work
To play a song that's almost perfect but it need my verse
You got an artist, but I'm family, but you need a purse
You hit the city but don't call me first, that's what fame gets you

[Hook]

When I pull up, it’s over (I pull up, it’s over)
When I pull up, it’s over (I pull up, it’s over)
When I pull up, it’s over (I pull up, it’s over)
Better cuff yo chick, this shit here legit

[Verse 1: Big Krit]
5 in the morning, wide and yawning, can’t turn my beat up
On the way to a bopper with a crib that I kick my feet up
See the candy was shining, freshly priming, first time I seen her
Now she wanna ride high with her head in the sky look down on all her people
Ain’t it crazy how pavement be cracking when I’m slabbing them ‘bows
Hoes go to jump in and can’t find the handles on my doors
So much twerking and working in here, I should install a pole
For them strippers that love to suck and fuck and get, get down on the floor
Transformers can’t fuck with this, not the way my doors flip
Skyscraper tall when I creep and crawl, is that Krit or a solar eclipse
Rise of the apes in my trunk, while my chariot swanging down
Make a pro catch ghosts like the rapture approach when my old school come around

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sant]
Say bitch I pulled up on the curb, straight peeled off with yo girl
Said she wanna ride with a pimp, wanna get that dick that she deserves
Said my back seat softer than a pillow top, paint so wet that it hit the spot
And I’ma quench ya thirst, that little nigga should’ve did it first
You was holding hands and I was in her purse
I’m getting throwed up under city lights
She right side checking lipstick, tryna make sure that her titties right
We in the parking lot with the trunk open and sipping
Sitting outside the whip with the wood grain wheel like it’s 1996
Yea trick I’m riding dirty, Big Sant bitch I know you heard me
Tryna get the ‘Lac with the ‘84s, tag just gon’ say “beg for mercy”
I just swerve and swang and bang it, but beware ‘cause a ho might leave you hanging
Better let ‘em know I’m forever ho, they kicking doors open, pay what you owe me
I told ‘em...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
See pimping is what pimping is and macking do what it feels like
Drip the drape with that ? stitching and 4s and vogues so I feel right
Candy paint on that body mane, chrome the grill and that woman
Them belts and bucks and 5th wheel on the trunk, you’ll hear beat knock when I’m coming
That bass so hard that it’s numbing, that chrome so shiny it’s blinding
Them seats so soft that I’m sinking in and so it’s no need to recline ‘em
I drop the top and you see me, got different shit on each TV
Got one with Sopranos, one with The Wire, the one up front is Boardwalk Empire
Wood grain wheel so goddamn new, that sap come out when I grip it
I represent for that PAT and that H so hard, I’m still tipping
I chunk the deuce when I flip it, for my city I put on
RIP to the Pimp, this UGK for life for real and I’m gone

[Hook]



*Baby crying*

[Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]
I was born in '86, despite the wolves and rats
Survived the wild and returned with these bear furs on my back
To feed the family, drink the wine
Give thanks to God and watch for signs
The winter's cold
But we was chose to rise above the darkened skies
And fight against what lied beneath
My feet are firmly on the ground
Prepare my soul and grit my teeth, fight or flight is going down
What man amongst me says that I ain't fit to wear my Father's crown?
A King of Mine and mine alone, my blood line can't be renounced
Stand up and be counted for, raise your fist as Glory speaks
Heaven's what I'm dying for, I swear the Devil's at war with me
I deal with life accordingly one day at a time
And that kingdom we all searching for I pray one day we find
So many have long and gone, so many got left behind
But as time travels and Earth unravels, church bells still chime
Planets still align as angels watch over
I break the chains they gave me and put these medals on my shoulders
Cause I ain't no simp

[Outro: Miya Bailey]
You'll be different
You'll find comfort in family
Your power lies in your faith and beliefs
What's a king without a crown?
Or a kingdom to call his own?
This is purpose



[Hook]
I don't know about my dreams
I don't know about my dreams
All that I know is
I'm falling, falling falling, falling
Might as well fall in
I don't know about my dreams

[Verse 1]
In a room full of tight stares
Was LFU a dream or a nightmare
How dare I rap about my real life
Good Lord I gave my all but this don't feel right
Jiggaboos'll minstrel you but never me
Blackface my black face could never be
Sambo my camos say otherwise
The revolution of minds will never televise
One album I'm still kicking
Def Jam, tell 'em I'm still with it
Tell 'em I'm still winning, tell 'em I'm still in it
Next time I drop a bomb, I swear I'mma kill niggas
No pause is needed, I swear I don't feel niggas
Snakes is in my front yard, I swear I'mma deal with 'em
All that still hear me, pray that they still get it
I feel like I failed y'all, it's hard to live with it
My dreams

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I don't know about my dreams
Cause I'm more spiritual than lyrical
Produced my whole album, nothing short of a miracle
Was I wrong to be so heavy-hearted?
I refuse to give up what I started
For false awards and cover boards in every store
A different shore is a bore when all my people poor
Yeah there's some broads galore but yeah I wanted more
Fuck a reality show, I'd rather do a tour
I'd rather crowd surf
Before I live as if God ain't real, I'd rather die first
Bury me inside a cemetery
Remember me as just a visionary
I'm more Geronimo Pratt than OG Bobby
They love the fact you made it but hate the fact you got it
The stairway to Heaven is packed, I'm in the lobby
Too scared to go to sleep cause most times I often doubt my dreams

[Hook]



[Intro]
Remember a child's place is what I often heard while asking
About the things no adolescent could imagine
Trying on the pants of a man I had not yet become
Hands too small to button the buttons my father often fastened
While speaking on his dreams and ambitions
Although I could never understand
There was comfort that I listened, with mention to be better than him

[Verse 1]
Be a better man in a world of negligence
Pedophilic meddling, son don't trust your reverend
When they settling for settlements
Lock your doors, shut your windows, don't let the devil in
The media graffiti us with relishments
Money, cars, and clothes I suppose what successful is
They say sow you're oats, it's natural to experiment
But don't get sucked and fuck and run amok - be celibate
Only 14 when I first cut
I wasn't her first, I had to strap up
And thank God for them condoms that my papa gave me
Cause a convo 'bout birds and bees wouldn't save me
From a child I couldn't shoulder, pushin' in a stroller
Down the streets of 3OB while all my homies asked to hold 'em
Proceed to play ball, when he cried I can't console him
I truly wasn't ready for kids, that's what he told me

[Bridge]
I had a rich dad, poor dad
I had a rich dad, poor dad
I had a rich dad, poor dad
I had a rich dad, poor dad

[Verse 2]
Never in a sense of money spent
Christmas trees are beautiful without presents up under them
Lead by example, don't get caught up in the rapture
Life is just a raffle, mostly pain, but some laughter
The older that you get, it's even harder to believe
No superheroes on TV you used to see
Remember that I told you slow down, control your speed
The more you walk with God, the harder it is to scrape your knee
I remember when I fell from my first bike
There were no "are you okays" and rarely "are you alrights"
Just dirt in my pockets, handful of gravel
That's when I realized that getting up is only half the battle
The fear of falling off will haunt me well into my teens
The moment that the world took a shit upon my dreams
Cause money is the root, and love is all we had
In fact, I'm glad, I had a rich dad, poor dad

[Bridge]



[Verse 1: Bun B]
Say, R.I.P. to Pimp C, he was the King of The South
If you hating on that, you need to shut your fucking mouth
I'm down with Lil J til' the muthafuckin' grave
Disrespect, they gon' put your picture on the front page
I'm center stage shining in a foreign you ain't seen yet
Chrome look like water, and my candy paint is lean wet
Don't forget the rims, them muthafuckas a clean set
You can't tell me that this ain't cost ya boy a mean check
Looking like a G in here, been here I'm gon be in here
When it's over, I'ma be the only one you see in here
Repping P.A.T. in here, realer than these other guys
I'm triple OG bitch, don't let them tell you otherwise

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Young nigga out here on the rise
Young bitch, you really need to ride wit me
Smoke something, hold up, hold up
Young nigga out here on the grind
Young bitch you need to get live wit me
Smoke something, hold up bitch

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Put Multi on the mountaintop
Drop the label just to raise the stock
You ain't seen a trunk until it pop
Full of 15s that'll make it knock
With them neon lights that say
Get in line or get down hoe
If it wasn't about the player money to be made
What the fuck you come around for?
This is big business, talking skyscrapers
Screens rise like smoke vapors
Candy paint's when it's Now and Laters
Bitch, I'm on the up like an elevator if you didn't know
Shine the grill just to let it show
On them emotional mothafuckas in the game
Tucking they nuts while I'm letting mine hang
Chromed out the rim, letting em' swang
Went from have-not to having some dames
Diamonds out the window, gripping the grain
One finger'll put the sun to the rain
Uhh, ya'll niggas thought I wasn't gon' be a king like I'm sposed'
But I learned from UGK, Multi, "4eva N a Day" on these hoes

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Young nigga out here on the rise
Young bitch, you really need to ride wit me
Smoke something, hold up, hold up
Young nigga out here on the grind
Young bitch you need to get live wit me
Smoke something, hold up bitch

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T]
This for all the underground, we on the surface
South been holding, remote controlling
Got the game and it ain't for purchase
Ain't no hurting when you win, up the cut like in it
Touchin' down on it, clown on it, cheerlead if you wit it hoe
Old school on its tippy toes, chop the base and shave the doors
Fade the top, then let it show, how it taste? I got to know
Ice the grill, cold enough to freeze the snow
Bruce Lee, boy, sho' nuff that bumping dragon, I got the glow
Got the cake, smash it in your face, I got more to make
I'm on the chase for a bread truck to put off in my safe
And let it bake, stingy with the flakes, all the crumbs get ate
Off the plate, sop it up with the lobster, shrimp, and steak
Krizzle

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Young nigga out here on the rise
Young bitch, you really need to ride wit me
Smoke something, hold up, hold up
Young nigga out here on the grind
Young bitch you need to get live wit me
Smoke something, hold up bitch



[Intro:]
Shout out to everybody that has supported your boy since KRIT Wuz Here, you feel me? People that support me further back than that. Shout out to K4L, that's 4Eva N A Day, you know what I'm saying? It's always Multi til the motherfuckin' sun die

[Hook: x2]
Ridin Dirty, super tight, I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin Dirty, super tight, I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin Dirty, super tight, I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin Dirty, super tight, I'm with the - have y'all thinkin' I'm Barry White

[Verse 1:]
Shit, (?) what you know bout me? I play the game on key
Break a bitch, then wreck a trick for it's D-O-E
I never slipped on game so motherfuck your fame
Fifteen minutes can't compare to how I bang
Out the trunk, the Lac, the (?), slept on wild
Couldn't beat my shine unless you clean my tile
Wax on, wax off, if you a fuck nigga
They claim they shootin' where I'm ballin', good luck nigga
I still hold my nuts and cobra clutch these bucks
You hold a broke bitch down, I tell a bitch get up
If a bitch don't fuck, then a bitch gone suck
You lost site on the gold cause you talk too much
I ride around clean with my frame on lean
Fishbowl, raise the doors as I drop my screens
With a porno playing, fifteens banging
Going back to the future in my time machine
Cause I was

[Hook: x2]



[Intro: Big KRIT]
Young Krizzle
I appreciate everybody out there listening to this right now
See Me On Top volume 4 shawty
And Cadillactica coming soon
November pimpin' it's going down

[Hook] (x2)
I'm riding low, low, low, low, low
Got nowhere to go
I'm out in smoke

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Cl-cl-club jumping, late night on the creep
Ain't nowhere to be
Push a ham sandwich on them peas
Searching for the cheese with a flashlight
Damn I gotta get this act right
Hear my partner bout this boppa that was boppin
But what her ass like?
That shawty, she was that shawty back in High School
Grew up to be fly, when them buss-its used to slide through
Remember little devil that used to hang out with your sister?
Yeah she a bad mother fucker
Plus I heard that she a stripper
Check her Instagram pictures
Yeah she twerking at the shake junt
Now she down for cutting just for showing his 808's thump
I know, people don't dance no more
But when she on that pole
To be honest she can go
Make me throw a little bit more
Than a playa probably should have
There's a thin line between trickin' and woulda, coulda..
Fucked her, if I had a chance
But all she did was stack the money
Thank me for the bands

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
I'm riding low
Still solo dolo at the corner store
Leaning on my whip like I got vertigo
Screening for them laws
That just stress you cause when you trying to get it in some
That when they catch you on a lonely night, super quiet
My eyes wide shut, to my surprise
Picked up birds with plenty feathers with my eagle eye
Bonafide, the ass fatter than Pirelli tires
Let me reside in your domicile
[BIIIISH]
I said that under my breath, but
She preceded to walk over to me like you gon' step, huh
I said yeah cuz, you ain't wait your man
It's 3 in the morning, you look lonely, help me understand
So we parlay, parlay, parlay..
Asked if I was down to escort her to this party
Then maybe we could kick it after?
Her girlfriend cancel..
Cause she a private dancer
I answer
I'm riding low

[Hook] (x2)



[Hook: Jamie N Commons]
If they kill me on Friday
Bury me on Sunday
Mourn for me Monday
Then you gotta let me go, go
Then you gotta let me go
If they kill me on Tuesday
Bury me on Wednesday
Mourn for me Thursday
Then you gotta let me go, go
Then you gotta let me go
'Cause Saturdays are for celebration

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Mama, no need to worry 'bout me
I promise that I'll be home soon
God got me like every day
While the Devil like "what you gon' do?"
Temptation ain't motivation
This money could never make it better
Cadi cleaner than it'd don' ever been
But it's blood all on my wood and leather
Ain't no tellin' if I'ma get it right
Look to God up-under city lights
Pray to God, he wanted me to ball
Cuh being broke ain't really living life
People dying like every day
If I leave, tell 'em take care for me
If I ain't fit to see the sun again
Somebody say a prayer for me

[Hook: Jamie N Commons]
If they kill me on Friday
Bury me on Sunday
Mourn for me Monday
Then you gotta let me go, go
Then you gotta let me go
If they kill me on Tuesday
Bury me on Wednesday
Mourn for me Thursday
Then you gotta let me go, go
Then you gotta let me go
'Cause Saturdays are for celebration

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
In the event of my demise I won't go kicking and screaming
I know that God had a reason, just don't give up believing
As long as the sun shines after the storm
So we don't cry at the dinner table
Rejoice and just be thankful
I made it, I'm home, sick of lyin', safe and sound
Battle with drinking so please don't pour me no liquor
Out on the curb, fight the urge to go retaliate
Carry on, just be strong enough to walk away
Uh, speak the truth even if they crucify me
Uh, free my soul even if they chain my body
Uh, look to God if ain't nowhere to go
Beware those prophets that touch a leg before they touch your soul
We reap what the sow when the boat man cometh
Gotta pay what we owe
Jesus walks so I run to him
How can they love me when I'm knowin' what they done to him

[Hook: Jamie N Commons]
If they kill me on Friday
Bury me on Sunday
Mourn for me Monday
Then you gotta let me go, go
Then you gotta let me go
If they kill me on Tuesday
Bury me on Wednesday
Mourn for me Thursday
Then you gotta let me go, go
Then you gotta let me go
'Cause Saturdays are for celebration

[Intro: Female Voice]
Ah, the way the brother walks is beautiful, the way he talks is beautiful
Uh, the brother is beautiful
The way he makes love to me is beautiful
You know, that's my man!

[Hook: Cody ChesnuTT]
Platinum chains and rings is
All a brother knows now
Girl, you one of the first to know that
Gold is back in town
So you gotta serve this royalty
Believing in me and my dreams
Serving this royalty right
Trust what I say and what I see and we can get it

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Money, cars and clothes, and all the cribs
Never trust these lames and hoes cuz they ain't shit
Cuz they’ll just sink our dreams of things and jump ship
So we'll fly first class, full glass with blunts lit - float on
I shake the world if you hold on
Get your body off, just to turn your soul on
Your black is gold so when it dark, get your glow on
My words are heavy like a Chevy, shall I roll on?
Our love's unlimited
Vinyl record in the grooves of forever, bass and treble, bend this shit
Puff cut your affections like a painting God ain't finished with
Now had to be displayed so all these songs could say they finished it
I walk the talk so I can't run game
I'm the type of King that a need a Queen thats down to work and run things
I'm a lion baby, untamed
Before I devote my all I need to know one thing
Can you serve this royalty

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Whatever your heart desires
And to those that oppose our dreams and goals I set the world on fire
Go to war with giants of all kinds
So when you sleep without your King beside you you sleep fine
I be you knight in shining armor, swing down with a hammer like Thor for those that want drama
Travel high and low for those expensive garments that I
Peel off your frame after I fight in your honor
Cuz we can rule as far as the eye can see
If you down for the cause as long as your body breathe
Bet the heir that will proceed as Kings that's after me
But be colder than doors we close you'll have to be
There'll be tyrants that want nothing more than apathy
To defile on the kingdom of real and happiness
But history will whisper of our reign
Before I give my all, I need to know one thing
Can you serve this royalty

[Hook]

[Bridge: Cody ChesnuTT]
The dream is real if you serve this royalty
Leave your mama's house, make her proud
Serve this royalty right
From the valleys of Spain to the snowy banks of Maine
We can run this game
If you serve this royalty right

[Outro: Male Voice]
Thats right, she's behind me 100%, man
She believes in everything I believe in
And whatever I do, she go and ride along with me and do it at the same time, you know?
With no doubt in her mind cuz she know that I'm positive, and she knows that I'm out to get over, and she knows that I'mma try and get a piece of this country

When you see me in the spot, we be clubbin'
Poppin' bottle after bottle with my kin'
I've been fucking with my people to the end
Get a Bentley, a Beamer and a Benz

[Verse 2: K Camp]
These hoes flexin' on the pussy
Bought it off the lot and now they lookin'
Forgiatos on them damn exotics
It's ironic, I'm still blowing on that chronic
Move like sonic
It's a lot of bad bitches in the building
And they all want to fuck a G
Still remaining sucker free
Shoutout KRIT, he fuck with me

Hunnids in a suitcase

Now, phony bitches, get the hell off my phone
I'm sittin' on some millions, you still sittin' on chrome
Your bank account is crying cause it's missing all these commas
Seven series Beamer, still livin' with yo' mama
Ain't enough designer shades in the game for you to see
There'll never be a pimp type, light skin, player muthafucka like me
I'm a G, and I'm a tipper
We never smoke none of the same grades
Drank none of the same liquor
We're not fucking same bitches, not slapping the same asses
Eating the same foods or paying the same taxes
Driving the same cars or shop at the same places
When you bend yo' girl over she don't make the same faces
Motherfucker

[Intro]
Back one more again
Multi till the sun die
UGK for life
Good lord, good lord
It feels good to shine
Shine
Let's go

[Verse 1: K.R.I.T.]
By the time you probably heard this
I was on another verse bitch
Diamonds in the back with curtains
Breaking hoes off, I never dose off at my post
Never disrespect your host, or bite the hand that feed ya
Cufflinks cold as Ebenezer, my momma probably should of named me Caesar
Cleaner than a baptist preacher
That use to pimp
Gator shoes don't make the man
So primp primp
So keep on with that, like I won't whip back
Around in that lac, that you done seen
Don't worry about this, I'm serious about this
If you know what I mean
Shine on

[Hook]
Shine on
Don't get me wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we shining on
It's way too strong
Yeah, yeah, shine On
Good Lord they know it
Now, now, we shining On
Ain't nobody tripping cause the money already made

[Verse 2: K.R.I.T.]
So lately I've been observing
A lot of these niggas look nervous
Come on in, don't be ashamed
Go and steal some game from my sermon
Cuz elevation to celebration, I preach that there
And that bullshit that they serving y'all, I don't eat that there
Keep that plate, I got my own
Don't test my patience, bitch I'm grown
It ain't much you can tell me, granny ain't already told me
And she wasn't wrong, yeah we that strong
So fuck your umbrella, rainy weather, and all that shade
If God ain't want me 2 shine, he never would of let me chop on blades
So shine on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
They say man make money, money don't make the man
But it's a little bit of both
Cuz it will take some change, for you to make some change
That ain't just some shit I wrote
Man thats natural fact, and not evolution
My mind game still evolving
And I'm gonna keep on rolling like 24s
And this world just keep revolving
Good at problem solving, cuz im good at starting shit in first place
And it feels so good to be where I'm at man, cuz where I was, was the worst place
But time change, so I keep hustling, boys trying to make my time cease
But I'm laid back with my dime piece, shining hard like my time piece and its on

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Shine baby (3x)
I need you to come on one more time and just shine babe
Shine baby (3x)
I need you to do it like you do and just shine baby
Shine baby (3x)
One more time for all my folk 'm gone shine babe
Shine baby (3x)
They Can't stop me from shining on my own
(Ain't no shining like we shining (7x))
(Ain't no shining like we shining babe)

[Hook]



[Verse 1:]
Shook up off this bass, bust another case
Motherfunk your chase shawty, take it to the face
Been a while since we chill like we used to
I hope that pussy still feel like it used to
So if you're looking for some pimpin', I got beaucoup
Banging out your every corner like I'm (?)
Cast a spell with your web call it voodoo
Ring the bell, if you there, I might come through
Like one more time cause I gotta pipe that
I beat ya out the frame then you gotta fight that
You bite my bottom lip then I gotta bite back
A type that gotta freaky text, she gotta write back
I got it like that, shawty
Don't act like you ain't never been nasty
I really can't (fathom your change?) since I had you
I know that you a queen and you classy
But every now and then you should probably toot that ass up

[Hook:]
I gotta shake her up, shake her up, shake her up
I put the candy on the Caddy when I break her
Hey shawty hit me on the cell when you wake up
I got some bottles, you should kick it with me, later
I got her (shook up, shook up, shook up)
I keep her (shook up, shook up, shook up)
I had her (shook up, shook up, shook up)

[Verse 2:]
Shook up off this bass, tell me how it taste
Bring your birthday suit, motherfunk that lace
Been around the world like twice
Still ain't seen nothin' this nice
As your peach bite slice, sit (ripe/right?) up under lights
Throw a (?), super (?), yellow belly
Off the richter, swore she a stripper
The way she spread it on the pole, get it and go
Twerk till it's sore
She kiss it and blows and swallows it whole
Ah ah that's graphic, but she 'bout it 'bout it for
It's like gymnastics, when she stop, drop, and roll
Not to be bragging, but I treat it like it's gold
Shining brighter than some diamonds when we ridin' on these hoes
Cleaner than (?), or swingers and some vogues
Hand me my chalice
If I'm drinkin' you should pour
I was thinking you should know
If you got a man, cool, we can keep it on the low
On the table, on the floor

[Hook:]



[Hook: Big KRIT]
I'm tired of these smoke and mirrors
I see it clear
Too many bojangles' I cheer
In mama [?]
Playing dress-up like they real
But I know they fit
The progression of the people under the stairs
That's too poor to come up there
But we knocking doors, off the hinges
Tryna stay one with ourselves, and not these prisoners
That AK say I can go anywhere, without a lintian
Don't let these old Versace lenses, cloud your vision
Along with smoke and mirrors

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I had to take a breath and chill on it
I got some Soul that's if you still want it
Down home, country shit
Bitch yeah I'm still on it
You might have bit a style or two, but ain't no skill on it
It ain't jumping out the gym if there ain't no rims on it
Candy paint ain't poppin' enough that you can throw some rim on it
Say you got that Ghetty Green, why you sprinkle stims on it?
Yeah I got family to feed, suggest you throw some M's on it
Trim on it, money trees need water to grow some [?] on it
Buy a house, two or three and let my mama live on it
So I can break bread with my partners, contrary to popular belief they tired of toting choppers cause

[Hook: Big KRIT]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
How many blunts you plan to smoke today?
How many drinks you need to stop the shakes?
I know the feeling when the ceiling's the only thing to watch
And it's either gas your car or buy food for your spot
8 'O clock, on the dot, they call you for them bills
Sallie Mae don't give a fuck, that's how you know shit's real
So we comply, getting by is hard enough
Them law know what you sellin' cause they ain't that far from you
Stake they two damn cars from ya
And them junkies be [?]
Just the P will cost you re-up so you hustlin' for nothing
Wanna leave but all your people hold you back cause they struggling
So you feeling like fuck it, another crab in the bucket

[Hook: Big KRIT]

[Interlude: Big KRIT]
Gravity can't hold us, if you judging by my colors
Then you don't really know me, if you ain't at all love
Then what you trying to show me
Another car, another crib, another deal, another Rolley
Cause I done seen it all and
That's not a reflection of, what I'm meant to be
It's monetary at the less so
So what we gon' do now?
This time's ticking, please for give me
I'll admit



[Intro: Big KRIT]
What happened to the soul food?
What happened to the soul food?
I’m talkin' good eatin', good seasonin'

[Hook: Raphael Saadiq]
Out here in this world, just tryna make it
Everything I see, sometimes I can't take it
But damn I really miss those times
That soul food's on my mind
Mind, mind, mind

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Grandma's hands used to usher Sunday mornings
Now before Sunday school, I hustle and I'm on it
I can't slow down, nah, a dollar and a dream
In this life you live, you're either the dealer or the fiend
Leanin' horizontal
The acrobats on the corner, they flip
So when them white vans pull up, shawty, we dip
Out of view, could've been a track star at the school
But it took the police just to get that .44 out of you
Dash, sprint, hurdle, over those steel gates
They keep us in and keep folk out but we don't feel safe
As we used to back when we was in a booster
Watchin' our uncles drink coolers, talkin' pound-for-pound bruisers
Over rib bones
Now I sideways tote
How did Bobby Johnson hold it?
Pull the trigger 'til the clip gone
Potato tip, no potato salad
That American pie ain't even snappin'

[Hook: Raphael Saadiq]
Out here in this world, just tryna make it
Everything I see, sometimes I can't take it
But damn I really miss those times
That soul food's on my mind
Mind, mind, mind

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Aromas on the corner, these the soul, they say
Some greens just can't be cleaned and you can't wash out the taste
Of rotten roots
Salted looks and herbs
If it ain't made with love then it ain't fit to serve, I heard
Some get bruised and battered
Thrown away half eaten as if their seeds never ever mattered
It ain't ripe, it ain't right
That's why most people don't make love no more
They just fuck and they fight
What happened to the stay-togethers?
Yeah, I’m with you and that means forever
Grandparents had that kind of bond
But now we on some other shit
Nah, we ain't got no rubbers here
I know she creepin' so that ain't my son
Apples fall off of trees and roll down hills
We can't play games no more cause we got bills
Back in the day, the yard was oh so filled
Now nobody comes around here

[Hook: Raphael Saadiq]
Out here in this world, just tryna make it
Everything I see, sometimes I can't take it
But damn I really miss those times
That soul food's on my mind
Mind, mind, mind

[Bridge: Big K.R.I.T. & (Raphael Saadiq)]
(Never thought it'd be, no soul food on my plate
We gather 'round and lie, bow our heads and pray
And I)
I still remember, the family parties
The happy faces, no broken hearts
Nobody starvin', but all that there is old news
What happened to the soul food?

[Hook: Raphael Saadiq]
Out here in this world, just tryna make it
Everything I see, sometimes I can't take it
But damn I really miss those times
That soul food's on my mind
Mind, mind, mind



[Verse: Big KRIT]
It's feeling like one of those days
Dodging the sun, watching for shade
Playing the game, catching the fade
Doing what it takes to find a hole in this maze
Frankie Beverly melody in the tape deck and checkin' in the mirror for them ho laws
Tryna reach a quota so they so called
Control the atmosphere that I bogart
Good Lord, the streets ain't safe no more, I heard
From a little bird that always strolled those curbs
In the darkest alley where first come, first serve
The right time, the night time for her
But the day time's blurred
I knew her since the first grade, she was fast
I guess she never let up on the gas
Least but no least, she had me for some cash
The love of my life's now a ghost in the past
Crash landed in the worst place
I guess for some folk, everyday ain't they birthday
We ain't talkin' car if we asking mercy
You  think she wanna fuck? What if she really thirsty?
Holy water, mama daughter
I keep a shoulder
For them to cry on
Cause even the strong need someone to rely on
In these turbulent times, we got to fly on
So stand by, stand by, stand by, stand by



[Hook]
Trunk knocking when I drive, my sub came alive
Transformer in my ride, my sub came alive
When them hoes outside, my sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
My sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive

[Verse 1]
Caught you on the creep while everybody gone to sleep
A dog off the leash (woof!) the only way it speak
Motherfuck all them tweeters, that's the same for police
I never tone it down on some round in the streets
Come alive with the ball, crack curb by the yard
Bust the seats out the back, a monster's in the car!
If the monster went and start, it only come in large
Come alive for the star, but it came from my garage

[Hook]
Trunk knocking when I drive, my sub came alive
Transformer in my ride, my sub came alive
When them hoes outside, my sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
My sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive

[Verse 2]
Automatic quake make em' automatic shake
It's hard to feel your face, way on Mars feel the bass
Make a Martian, make Earth a target to get a taste
Ain't no room for yo' busted luggage, I'm out of space
In the trunk once it start to thump, I can't turn it down
It's too live for the pictures on your wall to survive
Outside talking, keep it quiet, I'ma kill your vibe
15s like it's Frankenstein, watch it come alive

[Hook]
Trunk knocking when I drive, my sub came alive
Transformer in my ride, my sub came alive
When them hoes outside, my sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
My sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
Then I heard "boom!" from the amplifiers

[Bridge]
Oh my sub, it knock and it bang
From the lows to the highs, it shakes the whole frame
Of the old school whip, it swang whenever I come through
I've been basing all night long
My sub won't do me wrong
All night long
My sub keep subbing on

[Verse 3]
Cause when I'm outchea on the creep for a speaker freak
Let me, let me EQ all her lows just to hit her peak
On the light, backrub in the backseat, tweeters where the stash be
I can't hear no lames over this bang, so please don't ask me
'Bout turning down, all this all this sound that it surround
Fuck the law, I'm gon let it bang til' it crack the ground
Bending curves, swanging and I swerve on the boulevard
Only me and God and you could never ever turn the knob

[Bridge]
Oh my sub, it knock and it bang
From the lows to the highs, it shakes the whole frame
Of the old school whip, it swang whenever I come through
I've been basing all night long
My sub won't do me wrong
All night long
My sub keep subbing on

[Outro]
New bass
That's new bass
More bass
New bass
That's new bass



[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Ever since I was a youngin' up in my grandmomma's house
Watchin "The Mack", reciting it back, like, "Boy what you talkin' 'bout"
Droppin' a switch, hittin' a lick
Trynna get rich off in this bitch
Droppin' my top, I'm poppin my trunk
I’m whippin' my wheel like I’m whippin' my grits
These niggas ain’t shit, these niggas ain’t real
These niggas is frauds
Most these haters been cuffing, crushing, loving all on they broads
So I pull up car, slam a do’, break a ho down
Run her throat 'til it's sore, pass that ho 'round
I say hold up, damn KRIT that's fucked up, I know it
They say hold up, damn, KRIT let's pour up, I four it
I’m feeling good, feeling great, how are you?
So much bass when I pop my tape
Can’t feel my face, can you feel yours too?
I got this here, I got this here
Might have to chop that up
Her pussy wet, she swab the dick
Might have to mop that up
She say what’s happenin'?, I’m trynna fuck
Might have to prop that up
Bop that up, cock that up
Don’t act all shocked, bitch, slop that up

[Hook]
I need that
I want that
I’m 'bout that
What’s happenin?
I seen that
I bought that
I own that
I’m snappin'
Yall niggas ain’t talkin bout nothing
Not a thing, not a-not a thing ho
Yall niggas ain’t talkin bout nothing
Not a thing, not a-not a thing ho
Yall niggas ain’t talkin bout nothing
Not a thing, not a-not a thing ho
Yall niggas ain’t talkin bout nothing
That I can’t do, that you done done that I ain’t did

[Verse 2]
Ain’t nobody trippin' on yo ho, ain’t into that
Ain’t nobody trippin' on yo ho, I give her back
Cut her slack, let her go, cause she was in the VI
Ain’t like I be askin' for attention when I be out
So much tint that I can’t see y'all, stressin' busses with they feet out
If you ain’t suckin' or fuckin', well, you should keep out
Shoot the kind of bill, when they buss it gotta be by
She ain’t gotta beg, if she lookin' I can see
Right on they V I drop yo tea top, haters tend to leave out
The bottles servin', poppin', shawty look at all that we got
Look at all that we on, tell them bloggers be gone
Fuck wutchu been talkin bout, they couch I put my feet on
Ain't no blood for these haters, ain't no love for these fakes
I was born in the country, I ain’t trippin on a snake
I been fishing for some bitches, all I ever had was bait
If you think you got a problem with it, tell it to my bass

[Hook]



[Chorus: Bilal]
Oh, oh
I'm comin' home
The the night is young
Oh, shine your light

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
For me when I'm out in the streets
Ends justify means when you makin' a meet
When you losin' the sleep that you sayin' you need
But what good is rest when it's family to feed
When it's money to get, when it's dollars to count
Fuck a job, you never raised for larger amounts
Keep the lights on, front door locked
'Cause the villains in the wilderness, lotta George Zimmermans
Damned with some innocence
So that mean he still out on the prowl for a black child
While the judge and jury crack smile, Lord
Keep the lights burnin'

[Chorus: Bilal]
Oh, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
The road is long
The night is young
The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say, say your prayers, shine your light
For me

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
For me when I'm out on the creep
Do whatever to get a meal when you barely can eat
I'm determined to fight the power to further the peace
Mama scared the police might make a point out of me
It's gets hard to sleep livin' life in a daze
When kings wanna be niggas, I hope it's phase
Queens down to be hoes as long as they paid
Chained to our oppressor, I'm knowin' we slaves
Who wants to be saved
When they claim that the prayers that we pray go unheard
In these God-forgotten days, just in case
Keep the lights burnin'

[Chorus: Bilal]
Oh, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
The road is long
The night is young
The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say, say your prayers, shine your light
For me

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]
For me when I barely can smile
And the sun refuse to shine when I'm out in the wild
And the raindrops tap the window pane on my room
Scared I lost faith, pray I find God soon
In a world full of alt-rights, I was left field
Black man born poor, I was black steel
Black man born free, this how blessed feel
Because my dreams are dreams, don't make them less real
Nightmares are still the same thing
I've fallen from grace, wishin' I had wings
Like a dunk in the summer but I ain't had spring
'Cause all that runnin' from trouble'll give you bad knees
Now how can I make a move without a play
I got freedom of speech but with nothin' to say
'Cause all that workin' for somethin', but they barely can pay
What the glimmer of Heaven giving me every day
So I wade in the water
Filled with the sharks, snakes, gators and piranhas
To the higher, higher ground of the mountaintop
Away from the shooters that's down for shootin' to take a shot
'Cause they believe in everything they ever heard
From the bigots and racists that twisting every word
So, a hotel balcony could be the end
Or a podium speakin' to family and friends

[Bridge: Big K.R.I.T.]
So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burnin' for me
So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burnin' for me

[Chorus: Bilal]
I'm comin' home
The road is long
The night is young
The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say your, say your prayers, shine your light
Say your prayers, shine a light
Shien your light, for me
For me, ohh
For me, ohh



[Hook]
My two eyes saw your third eye
From across the room
I can see your soul babe
I think you my soul mate
My two eyes saw you third eye
From across the room
You remind me of a Goddess
Pardon if I fall in love too soon

[Verse 1]
I hate to rap and live life all alone
And I know this world is full of so many clones
But you original in your aura, it's sort of
Radiant and I can't ignore it
So, I don't wanna buy you no drank
Besides, I think you'd rather smoke your dank
And that's cool
I know you came with your friends
So you choose
If you wanna share your vibe, it's on you
It'd be a lie if I didn't say just the other day
I dreamed of picket fences and children playin' instruments
A lot of incense in one instance
I saw your face, you were full of Grace
At least that's what we named her
My angel had a angel, and I was so thankful
I know I barely know you, but I think you're so amazing
Fascinating, breathtaking
More than enough, my inspiration

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
To be honest this is all new to me
Cause I ain't never know a third eye that I could see
Perhaps you're not in a space you're really supposed to be
We all hit the club from time to time to be set free
So, I won't judge if you won't judge
I think we both agree that this ain't the place for love
But I've known you in my past life somewhere, somehow
Stars aligned and brought us here, with no doubt
It'd be a lie if I didn't say you were something classic, far from average
I apologise if I'm oh so ol' fashioned
But I'm passionate about your passions
More intrigued with your mind
Than your ass and your assets
I'm asking how you feel
If I told you that I knew heaven was real
Cause only God could create something that gives me chills
So angelic and so surreal, I'm being sincere that

[Hook]



[Intro]
Leave the town, smoke some herb
Speak the word, drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through

[Hook]
We can roll around, leave the town
Smoke some herb, speak the word
Drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through
Underneath vanilla skies

[Verse 1]
Is it sad that I'd rather hustle
Get this money on the double
You don't get it
It's cryptic for the simple minded
The type don't see the future even if they right behind it
So I'm chilly willy when talking bout dreams to most folk
Cause to me it seems like a billion when you came up dirt poor
And that's like talking about the summer to someone that only seen snow
It ain't rocket science, either it's a dud or it blow
Damn, I wanna make some hard decisions
Like should I really get a driver when I cop a Bentley?
Is that thousand dollar suit worth it cause it's vintage?
If I bring two woman with me, does that mean I'm pimping? Maybe
Did the cuff links give it away
Or the mink on display, no hesitation to pay
Make reservations to play while most work
I'm in pursuit of happiness, I'm tired of hurt

[Hook]
So we can roll around, leave the town
Smoke some herb, speak the word
Drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through
Underneath vanilla skies

[Verse 2]
I just wanna go to Africa
Find the meaning of life and try to master the art of meditation
The purest concentration
Cause all this weed and drank I pour might cause me complication
But for now we spilling drops all on the kitchen counter
Breaking down God green earth, fight for what we had first
They knocked the nose off the sphinx so we can't tell
Coulda' been kings and queens, but now we pumping cells
So, fuck outta' here with your undercover ways
Snaking in the grass, looking to get paid
Fade to black
When I'm tryna' get my piece of mind
Let my girl massage my temple to unlock my shine
Just a matter of time, she say that I will become the man that I'm supposed to be
I put my faith in the hands of God even though times is hard
I'm happy just to be

[Hook]
So we can roll around, leave the town
Smoke some herb, speak the word
Drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through
Underneath vanilla skies

[Bridge]
Ain't gotta twist it like a [?]
All we need to know is where the bread at
Thinking bout some moves to make
Right some wrongs, bills to pay
Flashing lights, pass the dice
Let me roll Reverend, hope I hit seven
Baby need a new pair of shoes
If I don't give it, tell me what we gon do?

[Hook]
We can roll around, leave the town
Smoke some herb, speak the word
Drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through
Underneath vanilla skies

[Outro]
*Gun shot*
Oh shit
Who you in here fucking? (nobody, cachorros, cachorros)
Come here motherfucker
Sit yo' motherfucking ass down (Fuck you nigga)
Come here motherfucker (Hell)
Don't run (Whoo)

Don't worry about it, come on down here
And watch this barbecue twerk
(What's in this sauce?)
Woo!
RibMac, barbecue so strong it blow out your back
Aw hell naw!



[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
Why, Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Don't you see the grill
Candy on the frame
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
Why, Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Don't be pushin on my buttons
Wait a minute motherfucker

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Bout time niggas seen the real
Old school car with the grill
'Ghini doors, valet can't help you up out it
Top fell off and ain't shit I can do about it
Ride clean, every day's a holiday
Gettin paid, every day's a bottle day
And you ain't seen a pimp until you seen me on the corner
Last time your bitch chose me but I ain't want her
Get money, motherfuck fame
Tryna break a ho and make change
If you knew me from the ribbit then you knew that I was tippin
You's a motherfuckin liar if I ain't reppin' Mississippi
What you know about it
Krizzle still cold on em
My gift of gab came with a bow on it
So if you grind and you down for the smashing
So what you mean, what you mean, what you mean

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Don't you wanna rest off in this glass house
If I let you ride set that ass out
Don't play me like no trick that's just so overrated
All this superbassin' woofer quakin' got you motivated
Haters screamin favors never stopped me
Sucker motherfuckers never blocked me
Poppin trunk, droppin top as I beat the bass
If you don't know what KRIT mean by now then bitch you super late
Po' another fo' up to recuperate
If pimpin was a blood sport I kick it like a kumate
Working boppers on the field like it's 2 a day
Three a day, 4 a day, any day a pro say
Shake it for a player, let me see it
If you lookin' for a southern country bumpkin let me be it
You say you ridin' and you down for the smashin
So what you mean, what you mean, what you mean

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I knew a bitch named Mandy
She was a pink toe
She had a lisp so I asked her could she deepthroat
She said she never done it, she said she never tried
She sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin lie
I said baby don't you worry just get down on your knees
Cause some warm head will turn me up a couple degrees
So just throw your lips around this anaconda and squeeze
And you'll keep a nigga harder than some government cheese
I say all women are freaks they just need an excuse
Pretendin' they all tight when these bitches is loose
That's why I stay strapped up when I'm knocking the boots
And love that military pussy I just need some recruits (Troops!)
Salute a pimp, it's Luda pimp
Bad bitches join my team, ugly hoes exempt
After midnight don't play no motherfucking games
Cause if you do, all you gon' hear me say

[Hook]



[Hook: Big KRIT]
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready cuz, some days and sometimes, it's harder than it's ever been before
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready cuz, some days and sometimes, it's easier if I just let go

[Verse 1]
My partner hit me one time
Said he felt like killing himself
Ain't much that I could say to him
Except I understood how he felt
It's more to life than drug money
It's more to life than cars and clothes
But when you raised in the wild as a child with the lions and hunters that's all you know
We caught up in a whirlwind of bullshit
That's why it's hard to hear the pastor in the pulpit
That's why these youngsters down to rumble on the corner over numbers with the lumber and they ain't scared to pull it
I thought there was a calm after the storm
Its been category five since I was born
I'm losing friends everyday over strays
It's getting hard to mourn

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My home girl hit me one time, she 'bout to sell her body for change
Ain't much that I can say to her, I guess that's just a part of the game
There's more to life than fly bags, there's more to life than diamonds and pearls
But when you raised without a father and your mother never bothered, it's hard to stay a little girl
She caught up in a whirlwind of stage lights
She'll do whatever that you ask her if the pays right
Get a lover with no rubber cuz he claimed that he was clean, now she know what having AIDS like
I thought there was a calm after the storm
It's been a category five since she was born
I'm losing friends everyday over pay
It's getting hard to mourn

[Hook]



[Intro]
Yeah
I wrote a poem the other day
The punch line is 'What the fuck we gon' do now?'
Cause you gotta ask yourself
That it's always a situation you get yourself in you'll be like damn
What the fuck I'm gon' do now?

[Verse 1]
When the world turns upside down on my head
And I can't sleep no longer, eat no longer unless it's a full course meal
I'm tired of boiling water, that cook noodles that cost a quarter
What about steak and veal, I'd like to pay all my bills
None the Lord, but struggle I feel
My heart's too cold to warm your soul
My eyes are too closed to see your goals when I can barely see mine
Some are saying I'm blind to the fact when
Really I'm just blind by all these LED lights on your Benz
That make me feel less of a provider cause I can't splurge when I spend
It ain't world wide when I trend, shopping for hand me downs
Second nature tags for those pants we found
At the flee market, checking for a plea bargain on this shirt
Perhaps you got some work
I ain't talking about nine to five
More like soaking drive, baking soda powder pies
I can bag up anything you fry
If you got a ticky I can sell anything you buy
No harm done my brother, perhaps if I sell to you
And you sell to them then
We never sell to one another
Preach on if you must, two things to remember
Don't tell on me and don't use your own product
Cause that will surely thrust you into the abyss
Longing for things you miss, stuck in the 1980's
Talking about you Prince, ain't nothing appealing about laying in your piss
And walking in shit
Come up off your hustle, we can ride clean if we sell double
Then them laws coming we fall victim
To the stereotypical big rims fly niggas on the wrong side of town
Blowing loud, double cup, both windows down
That's when I look at you and you look at me
And we ask ourselves, what the fuck we gonna do now?

[Hook]
What the fuck we gonna do now?
What the fuck we gonna do now?
What the fuck we gonna do now?
What the fuck we gonna do now?
What the fuck we gonna do? What the fuck we gonna do?
What the fuck we gonna do now? What the fuck we gonna do?
What the fuck we gonna do? What the fuck we gonna do?
What the fuck we gonna do now? What the fuck we gonna do now?

[Verse 2]
I scoped her from a mile away
More enticed by her hips, I should say
I didn't see her face until I was front and center
Spitting that kind of game that was fundamental
Yeah I'm baller as such
After she removed her clutch from the seat it occupied
That checker board pattern had once again monopolized
That the Louie, her taste was one of those labels
And her story was one of her fables that I heard as a young child
That everything that glitters ain't gold
And some tigers are better left wild
But that never stop me, and her ring won't stop her
As we sip more alcoholic beverages on the roof tops of seduction
Her peanut butter skin blushing with lustful hues
To the bathroom she was again asked to be excused
I think she abuses the substance
But who am I to judge her want to lose her inhibitions
Then wipe away her past to free fall into existence
I know that feeling so we quarter the night away as two lonely strangers
Intertwine and entertainment in the spiral of cat and mouse
I'm ready when you are to hit the room
To be consumed in your sunshine
Let's pretend this ain't the first time
Let's pretend I am your man
Let's pretend we both clean and we know it
Perhaps I don't do this often
Perhaps you ain't out here ho'in
Maybe this was meant to be
Maybe you're the very woman God sent for me
In the morning surely I doubt it
More regret the fact I planted my seed in your green house and it sprouted
My mind was too cloudy to comprehend your decision
Two months later your stomach will grow from my adulterous conviction
Your husband will surely put 2 and 2 together
That one night when you didn't come home it last forever
And we can never let this down, your phone call was so profound
Cause he kicked you out and your pregnant, so?
What the fuck we gon' do now?

[Hook]



[Hook]
Yeah dats me, yeah dat, yeah dat, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Yeah dats me, yeah dat, yeah dat, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Yeah dats me, yeah dat, yeah dat, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Who dat getting money? Ay, who dat getting money, shawty?

[Verse 1]
Ok, I wake up fresh, get up fly, drape myself, pimp my ride
Hit that slab, throw some gold, making shawty get down on the floor
I’ma have to show my ass, ride on glass, pump my brakes, [then I’m mad?]
Pop my trunk, then I flash, a nigga wanna try to act bad
We don’t wanna play no games
Fuck with lames, trick on hoes, that won’t change
Caught my lane, swang and swerve, I gotta watch out for the curb
We don’t really play that, play that, yea! Yeen bout that, bout that, no!
Then don’t come round, come round, here! Cause we’ll let them, let them, go!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ok, I jump out fresh, shine all day, rep my hood, rep my state
Spot a little bad chick around my way, and holler out let's get paid
Always been about my grind, bout my bread
Don’t like haters and I don’t like feds
Don’t like shawties that tease all day like they won’t give a real nigga head
Peep this game just to get this dough
Throw it in the air when you hit this floor
Yea that’s me sitting on chrome feet
Maybe when you couldn’t see when I crept up slow
Watch yo head when I open my door, grab yo parachute then let’s go
Dark in the club with a pimp on glow, everybody saw me take yo ho like…

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Ay, balling, crawling, slamming doors! (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Be a pimp tight player like I’m supposed! (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Cuz my trunk on slam and my wrist on glow! (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Who dat getting money? Ay, who dat getting money, shawty?
I’m like show me where them dollars at (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Ski mask diva shopping bag (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
You ain’t spending then don’t holler back (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Who dat getting money? Ay, who dat getting money, shawty?

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Struggle make you humble as a motherfucka, hungry as a motherfucka
Perception is a bitch but the truth is a motherfucka
Tired of you motherfuckas, tired as a motherfucka
Ready to load a clip and get to bustin' in this motherfucka
Lately I've been on some other type of shit
Tryin' to find some light in this, searchin' for enlighten-shit
Exorcising demons every evening I been fighting with
Yard full of broken bottles, fighting not to take a swallow
Fully loaded clip I'm 'bout to flip and get to dumpin' hollows
Now everybody excited and I'm ready I'ma die to win
Head first I'm diving in, anybody fuck a friend
A word with no meanin', so I'm plottin' and I'm schemin'
I'm so done with this dreamin', dyin' slow and barely breathing
Ain't no future in this bullshit, rappin' or the street life
Carvin' my intestines, and deception is the dull knife
Switchin' my direction want perfection and a new life

[Hook: Big Scoob]
High prices on the blow (let go)
So it's hard to get dough (let go)
Tried to run up in my pad
Trying to hit me for my cash
So I thum-thum-thum (had to let go)
Sick and tired of this shit (let go)
Old homie turned snitch (let go)
Homies brought it to the light
Redded all in black and white like oh no (had to let go)

[Verse 2: Darrein Safron]
G shit my jeans ripped
My homies hold double XL magazine clip
The heat spit like loose teeth
The kid kick like Bruce Lee
Y'all false as Bloods that bleed Crip on that weak shit
I'm 2-3 ballin' but I peep shit
This for anybody that say that I'm on some sweet shit
This is for the Darrein is just too R&B shit
This one for the money cause y'all always on some free shit
I'm from the city with a system of poverty
I've seen my homies go from ride or die to a rivalry
I've seen these hoes loyalty turn into a robbery
Like God can you please bless these hoes with more honesty
But trust me I tried it before
They say my city on fire like the devil horn
I been talkin' to God he don't hear me though
Sometimes I just wonder should I let it go

[Hook: Big Scoob]
High prices on the blow (let go)
So it's hard to get dough (let go)
Tried to run up in my pad
Trying to hit me for my cash
So I thum-thum-thum (had to let go)
Sick and tired of this shit (let go)
Old homie turned snitch (let go)
Homies brought it to the light
Redded all in black and white like oh no (had to let go)

[Verse 3: Tech  N9ne]
Everybody hungry
Every night we on three
Aaron fight the Fahrenheit of very trifling homies
When they staring right before me like they care but they parasites and only
Wanna rare bite of millionaire Rice-A-Roni!
On yo nose, the flare light is there like a Hongi
Lead your layered life to lonely
Nigga you best leave my premises
You don't wanna be my nemesis
I'ma put it on the B.I.B.L.E. (Die!)
Then I read my Genesis
Nigga I train and I train for when they aim for my change
At the range ain't a thang they know my name and it's Strange
Leave your brains on the terrain dead if he came for the games
Not to explain but me and my dame keep a thang and it bangs! Ekk ket ket ket ket ket pooh pooh pdddit nigga
Taking the living to necro
They never knew Missouri killas would be hillbillies like Jethro Bodine, slept slow, codeine I'm so mean like Destro
And I got the green like a gecko
And I'ma never let go of it

[Hook: Big Scoob]
High prices on the blow (let go)
So it's hard to get dough (let go)
Tried to run up in my pad
Trying to hit me for my cash
So I thum-thum-thum (had to let go)
Sick and tired of this shit (let go)
Old homie turned snitch (let go)
Homies brought it to the light
Redded all in black and white like oh no (had to let go)



[Intro: Big Scoob]
Yeah
The homie Don P called the big fella in to talk about this repetitive ass cycle that we livin' in the hood
No matter how much we struggle, how much we fight
It seems like the perpetual quicksand is always grabbing us and pulling us back down
So I'm not here to play the victim or no shit like that you know what I mean
But with that being said

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
If a pussy run his mouth about yo boy I'ma sock him
Hang a chopper out the window of the low, get to choppin'
Mind frame of a slave in the days of pickin' cotton
Only difference nowadays your favorite rappers say it's poppin'
Pushin' product to my people, living evil for the profit
Stay hungry, gotta get it any means, that's my logic
Who gives a fuck about destruction, who I'm crushin' for this dollar
Hard times make me holler, gots to get up out this squalor
Push a cherry red Impala with these cherry Chucks on
Who gives a fuck what you think of me, let it be known
So proud of my pedigree, strong as King Kong
Until the last breath of me, this the shit I'm on
Mind frame of a soldier, I'm at war with my people
Wicked teachings from these demons planted deep in my cerebral
Yet I'm smart enough to know it but the knowledge ain't enough
To get the fuck up out of here I gotta get above quicksand

[Hook: Big Scoob]
I ain't never been a quitter, they don't come no realer
I'ma stand up nigga, quicksand
As long as I'm livin' all I know is go get it
Ain't no fucks given, quicksand
I'm in too deep, no turnin' back now
I'm playin' for keeps, quicksand
I ain't had no sleep, I am these gutters, I am these streets

[Verse 2: Godemis]
I pray for anyone living under duress to be blessed
Created to be free ain't no reason to see any less
I peep the social media leading to giving me stress
The black lives matter is really a lot of BS
Could we just attempt to be honest with one another
Talk about the kid you know with no father who got a mother
Older brother was a positive figure in the community
Who caught a case and ended up wasting his opportunity
As soon as we get real with the will to address the evil
It becomes crystal clear every one of us still inequal
Don't believe in any system they say was made to defeat you
If any of it matters at all it has to be fecal
I've had it up to here about the talk about reparations
We need to steer the focus on getting some education
They say it's the white people hating, they ain't attacking you
Nobody black is packing up tryna go back to Africa
Facts

[Hook: Big Scoob]
I ain't never been a quitter, they don't come no realer
I'ma stand up nigga, quicksand
As long as I'm livin' all I know is go get it
Ain't no fucks given, quicksand
I'm in too deep, no turnin' back now
I'm playin' for keeps, quicksand
I ain't had no sleep, I am these gutters, I am these streets

[Verse 3: Stevie Stone]
Yup
They in the trap now
I said them backyard niggas don't back down
They used to bend a couple corners with the straps out
They got a short fuse, they act out
Got lean, got dope, got the packs now
All day in and out up out the crack house
Got to worry about the law, and the money, and the bitches
No love for the game, nigga everybody [Snitchin']
What's real

[Hook: Big Scoob]
I ain't never been a quitter, they don't come no realer
I'ma stand up nigga, quicksand
As long as I'm livin' all I know is go get it
Ain't no fucks given, quicksand
I'm in too deep, no turnin' back now
I'm playin' for keeps, quicksand
I ain't had no sleep, I am these gutters, I am these streets

Imma' be paid forever

Finally Famous Nigga

[Hook]
I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Verse 1]
All this bread can’t be too good for my cholesterol
Don’t come round’ talking loudly, fucking up my repertoire, dawg
I can’t lie bruh lately I’ve been stressing heavily
Im sipping, popping, smoking on whatever take the pressure off
You bitch you, FF Imperial til my burial
Dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti-fuckboy material til I’m dead, I’m living proof
If you focus on what’s in front of ya and not what’s in the peripheral
It’s gone, word? Boy I seen drama on drama
Drama on drama over comma on comma
I’m bringing home dead prez, my house done feel like its haunted
I put the city on my back, right along with my garments
Went to sleep, snoring

[Hook]
I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Verse 2]
I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican though
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian though
One cook, one clean, the other PMS’ing, no Hablo ingles’
If police ask questions, we don’t know what that mean nigga
They say Detroit going through the great depression
Still it’s been depressed so long I can’t even tell depression here
My homeboy still gon’ pull up on them rims big as a Ferris wheel
So many rides up on the curb my lil cuz thought the fair was here
Like oh, Im primo, top spot redeemed ho, for who? My team
And we might take a trip to Jamaica, Montego, pussy and flamingos
Got me thinking the fuck I need to sleep for?

[Hook]
I woke up working like I'm Mexican

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Bitch, I do what I do, I feel how I feel
Got my drink on the rocks, got my house on the hill
Got the girl of your dreams yep I pop her, for real
And I'm thumbing through bill after bill after bill
After bill, but I still pay respect to my city
So much man you thought I was in debt for real
Every day is a chase, every night is a thrill
I feel sorry for whoever's not in the will
G.O.O.D music or die ho, shout out to Ye-Ye
Dumped all my other hoes, shout out to Nay-Nay
I start my day with a prayer and vagjayjay
I'm higher than Day-Day, no off day just pay day
Boy, since I was a baby I swear I was OG, you was a no G
Textin' these hoes that you love 'em and shit, prolly using them Emoji's
When you was a OG, bitch, I'd still be more G
Fuck you know about night terrors, nightmares and night scares
About not gettin' that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair
And I done dropped "Control" just to show you hoes who done got controlled
You saying that I changed, yep, changed like I supposed
While you at the same crib still wearin' the same clothes
Going to the same club, taking the same pose
Pillow talkin' with the same hoes
All day about how Em ain't the same Em
And Hov ain't the same Hov
Some niggas never grew up, boy, they only grow old
I guess that what coming up in Detroit do
Finally famous is a Detroit crew
Fuck with me and you Detroit food
End up on the fuckin' Detroit news, better off in the Detroit zoo
Everybody got haters, I swear we been through this
Martin had Malcolm, Caesar had Brutus
Fuck am I sayin', man, Jesus had Judas
I guess I'm alright though, if I just got you, bitch
You gon' pull up friend to friend, I'mma pull up Benz to Benz
While you and her are cheek to cheek, me and her dick to chin
That's the difference between a 9-to-5 and a 10-to-10
Sean Don...

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
They done fucked up now, ha-ha
Mastermind...

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My kilos on ice, my sneakers snow white
I got a place at the Trump, just to pray for advice
My new bitch is Hispanic, got me speaking bilingual
Some call it trickin' cause this bitch thicker than Trina
Anybody wanna motherfuckin' die? Come try me then
You ain't real till you fucked your dawg's ho
Seen a brick and had to buy a Benz
Comin' through and I don't fuck with niggas
Bitch you wish you wanna fuck a nigga
Good chance she done fucked a nigga
Turned around and said "fuck a nigga"
Stack on my belt, double M we a cult
Mastermind's in control, so nigga fuck what you thought
16's of coke, all my verses be dope
Fuck XXL cause I'm the source to these quotes

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
I've been up from ten to ten, (oh god) swear I won't sin again
Raising Hell in my residence, Godly presence with presidents (Straight Up!)
My day job ain't made me shit, public housin' ain't got no fence (La Flame!)
And college ain't make no sense, niggas whole home invaded quick (Straight Up!)
I done work, I done pay my dues, I'm induced, now I'm overdue
One hit one, call this voodoo, don't want apes to jump out the zoo
I got one mountain, one problem
Plus the issues, I can't solve them (Straight Up!)
But it's nothin', and I'm still in the club on the couch still fuckin' up somethin'  (La Flame!)
Nigga please!
Mama please, I'm never comin' home 'til I make a hundred G's (Straight Up!) Scratch that, 'til I make a hundred million, then
I'mma stretch that 'til I make a hundred trillion (Straight Up!)
Who knew one day your son would grow up and learn how to be the boy (La Flame!)
Did songs with Hov, now hallelujah fell asleep the real McCoy
God damn, oh god, how you do that?

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I play the keys, handle dope, Barry Manilow
The game a bitch, but at times she sweet like cantaloupe
Hit the road, key of coke in the manifold
Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes
Japanese denim, down south numbers
Hit it once, trust it'll make a fat fiend stumble
Do the speed limit, Argo shoes
Call 'em penny loafers, they a pretty penny too
I'm tippin' strippers but I call it penny pinchin'
She talkin' shit but I can get her titties lifted
My new crib got its own city limit
Motherfucker got his own city in it
Blue marble on the floor, wet as salt water
Underboss I'll just play the holes like a golf course

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
One hundred keys, one hundred please
My gesundheit could make a whole city sneeze
Walked the mud jungle where they grinded out the leaves
So they swarm to my honey comb, hideout for the bees
You know what this sound like, money counters' sound bites
Machine gun fire, name ringin' through the town like
Church bells ringin', know what he was found like?
Colombian necktie over hospital gown white
She live on her knees, I live in a condo in the trees
The air's a little thinner that I breathe
The Iron Man Audi, let the top striptease
My life's in slow motion, but the watch screamin' freeze
Ugh, young nigga gettin' money
The feds' dragnet couldn't take nothin' from me
The decoy car is a crash test dummy
What follows is a hundred of 'em, wrapped like a mummy

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
B.I., boi
And they gon' risk a hundred lives
So they could rock a hundred whites
Baguettes lookin' like a hundred lights
Man when Blade died my city cried a hundred nights
Yeah I got a main girl, but I done hit a hundred tight
Every wrong I do I'm steady tryna do a hundred rights
Got her for cheap, compare the price
My nigga keep that low key, Barry White
And don't worry 'bout the info
From where they rob Pintos and could afford Enzos
Cause everybody knows keys open doors, but bricks open windows
Counting a hundred hundreds, more by more
Built this from the tile up, floor by floor
Talk shit, I'll send 'em door by door
Made for the Snow White like 4 by 4s

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony



[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin’ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
I thought about 100 things to do before I die

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Couple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type
Same shit different nights, till I live a different life
"Sean you looking tired", damn homie that’s all?
I’ve been stressin’ so hard I’m surprised I ain't going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into ya’ll, hatin’
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggas sleepin with that mac and I ain't talkin’ bout computer love
Owe the wrong people you a price tag
Now you pray to God hoping that you got a Christ tag
Make it where I’m from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there too, uhh

[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin’ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
I thought about 100 things to do before I die

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
If I just stop breathing
Even though I got all this muthafucking money
Won't keep my heart beating
Just don’t wake me up
Don't wake me up
You can’t catch me dreaming
Bout all of this muthafucking money
Cocaine rush, I’m speeding
Cocaine rush

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
I’m just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me
I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection at the same time
I’m accepting the fact that there’ll never be nothing perfect about me
Shit, I’m just waiting on a win
Come up with better hooks, the hoes’ll take it on the chin
We are 6 Mile bred, that's why you see our sick style yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chicks' y'all can imagine is chatty yapping at me
5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now I’m Cali swagging
Huh, my nigga listen, I’m over the fame
You number 1, I’m number 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin’ with lames, we ain't rolling the same
I’m the best out in this muthafucker
If I could get a check out of this muthafucka
Big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this muthafucka with no regrets
If you ain't living your life for your kids, I ain't giving yo ass no respect
Sean I love you my nigga, I’m out

[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin’ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
I thought about 100 things to do before I die

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I gotta break your fucking heart
I gotta climb these fucking charts (I gotta climb 'em)
I gotta do something that’s innovative
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia’s momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty of Carne Asada
I gotta, I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got a, I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote
I promise, I know the history of those who died
For the rights for me to survive but those who lied
To the minority will make em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt
The youths need to know every detail about this Earth
The devil controls it, so before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important, the end is near

[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
Thought about 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin’ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh
La-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky
I thought about 100 things to do before I die



[Intro: Big Sean]
Yeah, G.O.O.D

[Hook: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
I'm addicted to champagne and buying the mall
I'm addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law?
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hardtop
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up
Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise so my dawg can quit wearing
A .44 up on his waist like it's his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping "Ready or Not"
Who was just trying to do it big, but wasn't ready to die
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in peace while he alive
Fuckin' right

[Hook: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]

If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Seems life's never at a stand still, even in a photo
Thinking about the ex girl, I hoed though
Like would we have won it all, or would I have lost it all like Ocho
The things I think about the most are things I never know though
Like, why don't schools teach more mathematics?
Less trigonometry and more about taxes?
They at the chalkboard, teaching us ass backwards
How about preparing us for life instead of lab rat us?
With a mansion that's about five floors
No more sleeping on the couches, cause we got five more
With the fam that reminded me what I'm alive for
And at the same time remind me what I'd die for
A world where you wouldn't need sleep
That way we could catch up instead of chase dreams
And finally get the speedboat my dad always wanted
Mm, I swear I feel it coming

[Hook: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, J. Cole]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world (Cole World)
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world (Cole)
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world (Cole World)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Is this a dream? Well that's how it feel
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I'm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet a young Dennis, the menace to society
Check my sobriety, fuck hoes in varieties
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I'm getting dough man, these flows gon' retire me
Splurging all crazy
Switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy (Swerve)
Style on Nadal, I've been serving y'all lately, cheddar on Federer
Ball till I fall, et cetera, et cetera

[Hook: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world



[Verse 1: Big Sean]
OK, I'm smoking loudly, I woke them all
I pick up that tree, when it's not fall
I'm gone off that tree, when it's not tall
I'm in love with tree, I'm an avatar
I pick up a O from, my nigga Ralphy
My bro and me, but he is not alphy
Gone off that goo punch, it makes me drowsy
Roll up the windows, it makes it cloudy, Damn, if you ain't know
I made these girl night, smoke a paper and bowls
My ladies like blunts, hit 'em twice if not once
Then I blow 'em off and just pass 'em to my bro
Now catch you getting brain if a nigga not learning
I be spending money if a nigga not earning
Catch me in the backseat if I'm not stirring
And I be rolling up if a nigga not burning, boy

[Hook:]
I got five on it
Have your bowl and get beat
I got five on it
Nothing with that endo weed
I got five on it
If you got me stuck and not go back
I got five on it
Now let's go hop outside

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper:]
You know a nigga like to stay at that cruising altitude up in the sky
Try to fuck with paper planes but it's not the same high
Cleveland niggas ain't no bitches we prefer the cigarillo smoke
If you say it take away from taste then get some better smoke
Cause this shit I blow can get smelt on the next block
Ain't no middle mans every thing you need is in stock
This Glock is all the security I need
I be solo dolo, when you see me blowing on some weed
Why speed, no need, I be just taking it slow
I be so clean, diesel over powers my cologne
Now all the bad bitches who blazed on shifting this way
Y'all just some white belts, with leaves I am the sensai
Now bow to the bag never, save the best for last
When I come around niggas know to hurry up and pass
Fuck a dime sack, let's cop a quarter pound now
What the fuck is you gon' put down?
Nigga I got five

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
How wired, 6-4 hydraulics
Not stolen, lost my keys, I was high partna'
Fuck you want? This the raw paper not a blunt
You must, got me mixed up with Chip cause, This Spitta
Zig zag a whole zip up, shit strong shoulda' came with a bed pick up
Bitches calling me, wanna smoke beggin' for me to pick up
She blow me while I'm blowin' rings of that killa'
That weed you smoking brown, fake weed to much make up, clown
Get real smoking green, strawberry fields
High standing up feelin' like I'm layin' down, couple bugie Judy's came round
Actin' all stuck up, now they just stuck from smokin' with us
Had the hallway smellin', Is my windows opening enough?
I hear walkie talkies, Is security coming up?
Fuck

[Hook]



[Intro]
Finally Famous in this..

[Verse 1]
It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out
Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit
And they ain't major shit
Do yourself a favor: kick 'em out
Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life
I always say long days is better than long nights
At least in the day you've got shade
In the night its all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights
I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March 9th
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe
But I didn't know it was off of infested streets
Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat
I guess that's the hunger that got me out
At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbies out, you know?
Stuntin' like a bitch, prom night me out
And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
That was back
When
I was seventeen
It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had
It all figured out

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]

[Verse 2]
It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed
'Specially if you've got a vision
Or how you could have everything
And still think about everything missing
Like I probably remember the times that I missed out on
More than the ones I lived
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have
More than the ones I did
But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way
Two lying and one bed-never too tired
Smoke so much I need two lighters
Shoppin overseas I do buy it, who higher?
They taught me that I had to dream, black history month
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson
Front of the plane: I'm Rozay Parks
SUV swervin like it's O.J.'s car, oh
To me and my dogs is all gettin out
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
Finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out
That keep remindin' me at the same time
That I still ain't got it all figured out
Fact, the only thing I really figured out
Is that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck
Even when your bank account is all figured out
Even when your bank account gets all figured out
Even when your best friend gets all triggered out
Even when it.. all of it... when you still ain't got....

[Outro]
Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter
Every minute turns to the longest second, yet never ending
Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you
How old or young minded someone is
Cause we all start at the same starting point of a woman's legs
But each have our own finish line
Understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized
Is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong
Better to be in the hall of fame than shame
Whether it exists for what you do or not
We create this world so we make what exists
It isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized
And remembered for all the right reasons
Mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps
So when it's so late that it's early
And you need a drink even though the bar's closed
Remember why you do what you do
For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury
The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about
With who thinks about you:
Your family, your team
The joy of looking back and saying that you did it
Winning the game: hall of fame



[Big Sean]
Yeah, Finally Famous gettin'.. yep
Could you tell me where to go? I need direction
Where are we now? Where's the
Intersection?
Motherfuck my phone, it never has reception
In this cold world, it's all about collection
So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto
Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world
I made a promise to the mirror
That I'd, never ever ever go broke
Riding through the city, I be riding through the city
All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though
Plenty smoke, plenty rolled

[Hook: Big Sean]
So I'mma drink and smoke and fuck and go-go-go
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
All I know, all I know-ow-ow
Ow-ow-ow {*8X*}

[Wiz Khalifa]
While I'm flying over literally, flying over cities
Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though
My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabana
I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know
I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now
No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints
Seen the how-to video now he on point
And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one
If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none
Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some
And there's only one, you know you know
Khalifa got, I stay high like Pluto

[Big Sean]
Okay, I'm going hard (I'm going hard), I'm going dumb (I'm going dumb)
I'm
Going in (I'm going in), 'til I'm going numb ('til I'm going numb)
I got a lot to say, I don't hold my tongue, I just hold money, don't hold me up
Rolling in more green than a hole in one; you got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'
See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be
But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me
I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef
I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck
I don't dance, I two step, my weed loud, it suplex
I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex
Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG
Two fingers on my joint, one to the policeeeee

[Hook]

[Big Sean]
...Yeah
Ohh, yeah
...Ohh

Oh boy, I'm mad until these records gettin' shattered
'Til I'm MJ or Magic, ooh and she just want the status, so
You the man she got, but I'm the man that she been after
She done sent so many naked pics my phone ain't got no data
I walk off in New York like my name Derek Jeter
Headed home to the D where you know I keep a Gina
I'm the good with the evil, fuck you, nice to meet you
You can't have a peace sign, man, without the middle finger
With the clique when you see us, that's my family to me
That's my family tree, they're my arms, legs, hands, and my feet
And I can't cut them off with even diabetes
Hit the beat and kerosene it, scratch that, I white sheet it
A 100 dollar fade every single time you see us
Been a king all my life so I shoulda got a Caesar
Somewhere off in Vegas rollin' dice up at the Caesar's
Got me thinkin' back bout how I used to roll to Little Caesar's
Piece of pizza with Tanisha now I'm with a Boniqua

I don't like loose pussy or loose lips
And I done did the impossible a few times, Tom Cruise shit
Ho and I ain't satisfied bein' on that top 5 list
I ain't satisfied until I'm on that all-time list
Til everything I spit is all timeless
My girl on that all fine list
My life a little luck, a lot of grind
Bitch no maybe ho I gotta make it
Fuck your nomination, man fuck the world
I'm repopulatin', wrap my Rollie round my waist, yeah time's a wastin'
Niggas want the comma comma combination
Long as I'm around, it's gon' be dot dot dot a lot of waitin'
Got my pinky on her brain while I'm gettin' brain
Plottin' world domination, people ask me how to make it
I'm just like "man if you want the crown, bitch you gotta take it"
Straight up
Straight up



[Intro - Suai]
Tried to write a love song
I wanted it to be just right
Tried to make it beautiful
But all I could think of was our last fight
I was going to play it on piano
Have the drums come in real bold
But I couldn't think of anything good to say
So the big ballot strings will never get played
Pretty melody I wrote will never get sanged
Piece of paper I started with I thrown away
A song about our love will never see the light of day
Why, cause you made it that way
You made it that way
I was gonna write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games now you just
A lame who's shit outta luck, crazy ass bitch
I almost wrote you a love song

[Verse 1 - Big Sean]
She threw my watch out the window
Chain in her hand
She running through the crib finding anything she can
Our relationship is not the only thing thats outta hand
She even called my mama like you need to get your man
Cause your son lying on me, I ain't trying to get a tan
And this the last time he'll have me crying in my hands
So I'm heading to the club tr-tr-try and find a man
Bitch you headed to the club tr-tr-trying to find a man
What is you saying had hoes and passionate night gowns
But you the only one I imagine in white gowns
So where ya left hand you should let me add a ring to it
Because mr & ms anderson just has a ring to it
She like why you act like that to me and walk right back Mike Jack to me
Every time we fall out I'll throw yo ass out
But you just end up boomeranging right back to me
What the fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
I think you crazy, crazy, you need medication
You should calm down, you need meditation
Sending me a text with a hundred exclamations
About how I'm wrong without any explanation
At all before you say another nigga next up
I should call a maid down cause I messed up
But gave you what you need even on them shopping sprees
I would throw you paper like extra extra (read all about it)
She said what if we reversed roles
And you were front row cheering at my first shows
And a couple dollars later and some Louis Vuitton clothes
I could fuck a couple niggas thinking that you wouldn't know
And since I had no feelings for them then it shouldn't hurt yours
And since you thought I'd never do it it even hurt more
And I'll lie about it and you'll find out from the source
Whose word was more truthful then yours
What would you do

[Suai]
And I was so glad I didn't ever pen it
Now you ain't got nothing with your stupid name in it
And if I would've did it would've probably stay with ya
Listening to the lies you were constantly telling you did me all wrong
What would even make me wanna write you a song
So glad I moved on
Cause now I got a new guy thats turning me on
And the big ballot strings are about to get played
Pretty melody I wrote is about to get sanged
A song about our love is going to see the light of day
Why?
Cause you made it that way
Oohhh yeah you made it that way
Ohhhh oh yeahh I was going to write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games now you're just
A lame who's shit outta luck
I almost wrote you a love song



[Intro: Big Sean]
Yeah, you hear that?
That's inevitability; you can't stop this shit
I'm too tapped in, too loyal

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Surrounded by a few of my niggas who did breaking and entering
Through a bidness with them because they can't break a commitment (no)
Look, I'm a magician, I belong inside Magic City
Got too much intuition to just blow tuition on titties, I know
Young Metro got that stick, that's a sig, he don't smoke
Fuck around, get smoked
I can't think of one time I was put up on the spot, then I choked (I can't)
I can't think of one time I got rich then went broke
(Metro Boomin' wants some more, nigga)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Bitch, I'm doing digits, all business, big bidness (big)
See me on the block? Mhmm, bitches still business (still)
See my dick off in her mouth? Yep, bitches still business (oh)
Ye said, "Kill em all"

I'm set, sunset (skrr)
Put it down for the team that I protect (for my team, yeah)
Bitch, please do not interject (don't)
If you move too quick, I might take it as a threat (threat)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I'm consistent, I'm persistent
Got to get it, bitch, I risk it
Time to hit them big licks and make that shit a tradition
Yeah, what goes around comes around, faster than fidgets (woah)
Man, outchea is frigid (woah)
Man, these streets is vicious (vicious)
'Bout to get my girl some kids just to start a family business
'Cause it's all about business, yeah, big digit business
Yeah, look, we out here tryna start a franchise (franchise)
We tell the truth, you tellin' stories 'round the campfire (little bitch)
Yeah, it's all game ho, let it soak (let it soak)
Me and my bros rock the same chains around like we a cult (damn)
I'm the one in the bunch, they protect me like the Pope
Going all night on the daily though
Rolling down 7 mile, bet a thou'
Hit downtown then hit the Isle (skrr)
Nothing free, not even style
Free Vezzo, yeah let him out (free)
King of my city, man, feel like I'm Coretta child
I'm my mama's son, I gotta rise
I can't let her down

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Bitch, I'm doing digits, all business, big bidness (big)
See me on the block? Mhmm, bitches still business (still)
See my dick off in her mouth? Yep, bitches still business (oh)
Ye said, "Kill em all"
God the only witness
I'm set, sunset (skrr)
Put it down for the team that I protect (for my team, yeah)
Bitch, please do not interject (don't)
If you move too quick, I might take it as a threat

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, 2 Chainz
Got 'em waiting for my verses like it's Christmas to come
Would talk about my exes, but I'm dissing them all
Bought foreclosed houses, and I'm fixing them all
Any time I caught work, it was pistols involved (bow)
Yeah, I'm talking big business, here go the statistics
One out every five people trapping turn snitches
Get up out the game, put it up for a rainy
Hardest working man in showbiz, no complaining (no complaining)
Yeah, I get a rush from the grind (ooh)
Touchdown, bust down, single for tonight (yeah)
When she come over, deep tissue neck shoulder (shoulder)
Got a restaurant, a label and a clothing
Line, I ain't lying (nah)
Lying down the street (street)
Discount code, first come, gon' eat (eat)
And this ain't for the weak, I do it every week (uh, uh)
I do it in my sleep, got in it like ink (uh, in it)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Bitch, I'm doing digits, all business, big bidness (big)
See me on the block? Mhmm, bitches still business (still)
See my dick off in her mouth? Yep, bitches still business (oh)
Ye said, "Kill em all"
God the only witness
I'm set, sunset (skrr)
Put it down for the team that I protect (for my team, yeah)
Bitch, please do not interject (don't)
If you move too quick, I might take it as a threat (woah, woah)

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Look, boy, the bidness internal, the vision's eternal
These niggas will burn you
Don't ask no questions if that shit don't concern you (woah)
I've been standing outside all day, man, rocking my thermal
My off-white came straight from Virgil (straight)
My brothers on side of me, that's who I turn to when shit gets too turnt to handle it
Dolo, it's too lit inferno (lit)
While you was dozing, I thought I was nocturnal
I wrote every single success I had first in the journal
You bitches nothing but hurdles (nothing)
Boy, I'll hop right over you
Who the fuck you think watching over you? (huh?)
I'm God's favorite, you couldn't pray a hundred times a day
To have me over through
I'm the bipolar you
I'm doing what you way too hoe to do (hoe)
I got a ocean-view overview that reminded me this is overdue
Jeez, I don't got feelings, I just fill seats
I'm on fleek, I don't retreat (woah, woah, woah)
I did this shit in my sleep
Sike, I don't sleep, I don't cuddle
Bitch, I'm the team captain inside the huddle
The man of my house and the man your little brother grew up to (straight)
The man in my hood and all the other hats that I juggle (straight)
You niggas my little cuzzos, little niggas (little niggas)
Nobody sonning me
If I am a sun, I'm the one you look up to (I look up)
Fuck you
Big Bidness (woah, woah, uh-huh)

Bitch, this ain't beef, this is world war
Bitch, this ain't a show, this a world tour
Bitch, you don't know me, man, you know me
Bitch, this ain't the problem, this the solution
Feelin' like my chakras aligned
From now on call me Don
Rhymin' for days, I couldn't eat and it was not Ramadan
Niggas askin' for a cut, they just way out of line
Thugger

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Big Sean]
Ho, this ain't no Ford, this a Maserati
This is not a movie, baby, this a real dead body
I'm on a one-way street, 'bout to have a trolley
I fuck her one night then I'ma duck up out it
You do anything for this lil' bitch you might be a Cosby
Speakin' of Bill Cosby, I spike my drink with molly
You better not tell nobody, zip it, just zips and addy
Hit from the back, turn to a car when I'm backin' out it, yeah
Hit him with ten, fuck it, hammer gon' MAC his body

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Gucci Mane]
Bitch, this ain't time, this is our time
Bitch, this ain't the plug, this the power line
Bitch this ain't Diesel, this Gucci (it's Gucci)
Bitch, you ain't know me, man you know me (yeah)
Bitch, this ain't Adidas, this Puma
Bitch, that ain't the truth, that's a rumor (yeah)
Bitch, you ain't my friend, you a tumor
Bitch, that ain't the new one, this newer
Bitch, this ain't fourth-quarter, it's crunch times
No foul lines, just front lines
Fuck takin' shit, boy, I just take what's mine
And I'm still hungry like a nigga was unsigned
Don't nobody want this shit more than I want mine
Fuck a free meal, boy, I'd rather go hunt mine
When you get the ball, boy, you be fumblin'
When you talk that shit, be mumblin'
Man, I got my one shot
Fucked around and and-one'd it
If the dogs ain't there then they one call from it, look
Run you out your house and now your ass apartment huntin'
From that Michigan cold, and I'm colder than that
Don't fuck with my crazy ass, boy
Your mama should've told you that
One way in and one way out
This life just like a cul-de-sac
The hood behind me like a cobra back
You quote the internet, I quote the facts
But snake niggas never tell the truth
You a liar
If you swear to God one more time on your life you might die

[Outro: Big Sean]
Real ones, I know you feel me
Independent women, know you feel me
If you self-made, then you feel me
Text from my girl, she said "Come feel me up"
Real dawgs, I know you feel me
My OG's, know they feel me, yeah
Bad bitch, she want to feel me
Text from my girl, she said "Come feel me up"

(Mm, mm, mm)
When I was down, I swear they made me feel inferior (straight up)
Judgin' me by my outside, that's just my exterior (straight up)
Not seeing what I was made of, that's my interior (real shit)
Didn't let that shit break me, instead, I broke the barriers
So fuck all y'all, praise Allah
It's my perog' like Bobby, bruh, massages by Nautia
In my castle like Mario, I give this shit my heart and soul
You boys got no cardio, all of my soldiers rock army clothes
'Head of my time like Marty though
Watchin' the Rick and Morty show, while I smoke
All these bands, still fuck her on the floor
Came from the dirt, all I had to do was grow
Remember when my shit got repossessed (damn)
That shit had us workin' like we possessed (goddamn)

[Intro: Lori Perry]
Day after day seems like I push against the clouds
They just keep blocking out the sun
It seems since I was born
I've wakened every blessed morning
Down on my luck and up against the wind

[Chorus]
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused, yeah (no, no)
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused (don't)
We are not the same, boy I smile through the pain, 'cause
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I ain't going to your event
You do too much going out and not enough going in
I got too much going on, so I'm gone with the wind (gone)
And if I ain't going to work, then I'm going to the gym (to the gym)
Yeah, bitch I'm at focus
Don't get it confused
I'm too spiritual to lose
It's worth every single bruise
Long as the dogs proud of me, then I got nothing else to prove
Long as Milly proud of me, then I got nothing else to prove
I'm a G, I'm a Don, I'm a soldier (I'm a soldier)
I'm charged up, man I'm beaming, I'm solar (pew)
I'm from the streets, full of heat, don't get boiled
They chew you up and spit you out, like it's spoiled
And my mind is an open mind
I believe in the Bible and Quran
And I follow the signs, yeah not street signs
I mean universal signs, I'm outside
And I realize my life got more meaning than a triple-entendre
And I realize any time the perfect time

[Chorus]
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused, yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused
We are not the same, boy I smile through the pain, 'cause
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, look

[Verse 2]
Don't nobody know me like I know me (like I know me)
So I follow instincts only (only)
Man I done been double-crossed by my homies
I learned the hard way that they was authentic phonies (fake bitch)
Boy, shit so real in the field that I hardly stand still, but take care of my body still
I been drinking more water and popping less pills, man
Unless they vitamins, 'cause nigga I'm tryna live
And God blessed me like I got bad allergies
So I'm working like I run off an eternal battery
And if I dress casual, no I'm not a casualty (no, no)
And if I put my mind to it then that's what it has to be
Yeah you're fucking right damn, sure bitch that's for certain (fucking right)
Never cut the family ties, I only cut the burdens (whoa)
Got so many cuts and scars it look like I left the surgeon
Done been through so much shit, I'm like a whole 'nother person (thank God)

[Chorus]
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused, yeah (no, no)
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused
We are not the same, boy I smile through the pain, 'cause
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah

[Outro]
I'm in space, I'm in mind, I'm in tune
On a mission 'til I get inside my tomb and cocoon
Every success is just a checkpoint, pass and move
When I leave this body, I'ma prolly set up on the moon
Hold it down, I'm the glue
We be here, that I knew, since Timbaland and Magoo
And I proved and I bloom
I'm gon' win more than my room
Hand straight up like it's noon
If I can't live a hundred years, I'm gone way too soon
I'm in tune

[Producer Tag: Future]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you



[Intro]
Metro
We done came up dog and never look down
I might gotta throw my Jesus chain on for this

[Chorus]
When you put the work in man it shows
Straight up out the ashes then I rose
I done hit a all time low
Been at a stand-still and had to go go go
Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la
Breaking promises you need like na na na
No hearts, no love, no kumbaya
No hearts, no love, no kumbaya

[Verse 1]
Everything automatic so I can't waste time
And if we break up I only make up time
My team do this shit easier than lay-up lines
Never scared to cross that line or pay up fines
Look, Don Don Don, that's my top 3 in the order
Never took a shortcut
Meet a Crip off the late back
Y'all look like a short club
Shoutout to my loyal ones, I wish that it was more of us
Went from 30,000 a year to 30,000 feet as my floor plan
I got El Chapo with a choppa as my doorman
I'm on the other side taking care of what's important
If business not boomin' then it's time to change the format
Time to change the recipe, I'm special especially
Going for the record, no felony
And I'm dodging jail and jealousy
Day dreaming about a cruise with Penelope
Looking like success fell on me (damn)
And get rid of all that jealousy
All that hate in your heart
I ain't got no enemies
I'm focused on what's meant for me
Putting my energy back into me, real shit

[Chorus]
When you put the work in man it shows
Straight up out the ashes then I rose
I done hit a all time low
Been at a stand-still had to go go go
Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la
Breaking promises you need like na na na
No hearts, no love, no kumbaya
No hearts, no love, no kumbaya

[Verse 2]
Boy this shit intricate
Working like a machine, they keep trying to throw a wrench in it
But I'm too intuitive and into it
No ghostwriting, no sixth sensing it
That's why all this shit sound so intimate
That's why I feel like you know me before we face to face
As for the latest, I'm the greatest Ali Bomaye
I put that work in overnight like that shit due today
I paint the pictures they can't trace, try and you get erased
I'm less focused on props and more on property
Done put so much back in my hood that I changed the economy
I'm 'bout to build a movie theatre downtown properly
And help revive the heart of the city, just keep on watching me
And if these bitch ass niggas got they wish and stopping me
Just know I done done so much good business in my life
That there's gon' always be a job for me, a op for me
I never burned bridges so there's a hundred ways to get where I gotta be, Don

[Bridge]
Same people, you see on the way up
Same ones you gonna see on the way down
You feel me?
You love me, I love you
You hate me, I love you, straight up

[Chorus]
When you put the work in man it shows
Straight up out the ashes then I rose
I done hit a all time low
Been at a stand-still had to go go go
Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la
Breaking promises you need like na na na
No hearts, no love, no kumbaya
No hearts, no love, no kumbaya

Pull up with the spark, hit you in the dark (whoa)

And motherfuck the camera time, I need family time (yeah)
I need "go see Uncle John in Atlanta" time (John)
I'd probably never get it, but it's cool to fantasize (it´s cool)
Just like I do by old girl and these hands of mine (whoa)
Gripping on the titties, ass, and her thighs (oh yeah)
Honestly, I'm over her and her lies
Cartier over my eyes while I analyze
Ok, me and Lil Metro, rockin' new retros
Take off your dress ho, that's the new dress code (yeah)
Too blessed to stress, that's my manifesto (bless)
Fuck the professor, I'm too professional

I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect (disrespect)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
How a nigga changed and still stayed a hundred? (huh)
I ran towards change while y'all ran from it (whoa)
Y'all wanna ball, I'm Stan Van Gundy
She wanna hang with me and 'Ye, she know that's good company
I like my skies Carolina blue and white
True one, false move and that could paralyze your life (brr)
So understand, I'm the overanalyzing type (type)
Panoramic views while I'm panning out my life (look up, look up)
And I grew up playing GoldenEye (damn)
So I'm used to sticking to the mission while they taking shots
When you this high, you disconnect a lot (yeah)
Sometimes I separate myself to connect the dots (I do)
Only way I'm going back is going back home (home)
I don't drink tap water, but got tapped phones (brr)
Dior on my suit, I'm the troop
Money come around, I'm never out the loop (loop)
Kiss the bottom of my boot (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas love to the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect

I be damned if I didn't 69
I can hit this shit until I'm 69
Nah, fuck it
I can hit this shit until I'm six feet down
Deep in that dirt (dirt)
Whatchu gotta snooker just to leave in that skirt (skirt)
Got everybody watchin' while you leavin' from work (work)
Got the preacher watchin' while you leavin' from church
Baby, you know what you worth
I'm the only one that know what to do when you take that ass out
Sit it on my lap, that shit make me wanna cash out
Cum inside your face, oh baby, now you can't smile
Cum inside that pussy, I'ma give your mom a grandchild
I'ma make you cum three times
Four times, five times, baby, six times (damn)
I'ma ask you, "Is this pussy mine?" (is it mine?)
If you say no, bitch, you lyin' (bitch, you lyin')
'Cause when I take it out, you start cryin' (start cryin')
I'd done fucked around and realigned your spine (goddamn)
You look good from the front and the back
You lil baby, I'm the dad, tryna fuck so bad, 'cause that

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Head so good, pussy so good
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit I would
Yeah, I would
Yeah, I would
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit I would
Head so good, pussy so good
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit I would
Yeah, I would
Yeah, I would
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit I would

[Outro: Big Sean]
Oh God, oh my God



[Hook : Miguel]
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, Just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything
And you

[Verse 1 : Big Sean]
Yeah, I got a brand new Benz
Crazy right, brand new Benz
Got less miles on it than I do friends
Remember when we laid at you and Paige’s crib
Was there so long I coulda paid rent
Remember when we couldn’t get shit?
Best thing bout being broke is you don’t spend shit
Remember that Christmas? We had a wish list
We couldn’t afford nothin' but we still get shit
Ironically those were the times I felt the richest
All those times that we spent by the pool girl
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl
Maybe its because I had you girl
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris
And gave each other times that we cherished
Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower
And you got so drunk threw up? Yup you were so embarrassed
See those are times I can’t let go, I can’t let go
Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs
So you Sipping on XO til I snatch you up like “let’s go”

[Hook: Miguel]
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, Just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything
And you

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My bad for those long long nights, long nights when I left you in the sheets
Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep
Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep
Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful, distasteful
Yeah I know you’re not supposed to hate cake and eat too
Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full
What about the emails you hacked in?
I know we hate to live in the past-tense
It’s been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D
And ain’t came back since
Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city
That’s about the time that you left for the city
You and all your girls moved to NY
I shoulda’ known now how you watch Sex And The City
I know we ain’t close but, I gotta focus on blowing up
I know I promised that I’d be there, and really did I ever show up?
I know I wasn’t honest to ya girl
Almost broke every promise to ya girl
Brought problems to your world
And you said “how could you just lie to me? I thought you’d die for me?”
I was scared you’d find somebody who would treat you like you supposed to
You the type niggas get close to, get close to, and then propose to
And when Thanksgiving come around
I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma
So it’s back to the drama
“No I don’t know that number”
“Why the hell you text it?”
Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in
Young and living reckless

[Hook: Miguel]
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, Just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything
And you

[Outro: Miguel & Big Sean]
Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you
I can't imagine myself without you
I need a whole lot of help without you
Me and my granny both agreed
Damn you're such a G I’ll hold you down forever, B

[Hook: Miguel]
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, Just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything
And you



[Hook: Big Sean and Jhene Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes and goes
You say "be real" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (Funny, right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

[Hook]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa ew, time, kill, months, still

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy
I drank too much, please call me a cabby
Penthouse after party hoes want that addy
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like "Why you still talk to my mama?"
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college
What? All because I had you, nigga I dont even have you
How am I suppose to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems he got to deal with

[Hook]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Girl, don't believe them hoes
Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, "ain't no woman like the one I got"
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that would make me a one eyed fuck
Sch, I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

[Hook]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy



[Hook]
Asshole then, a bigger dick now Don't believe me?
Bitch look down, l-l-look downTell me how I look now

Airhead hoes On my kush cloud Thought I was cute then
Bitch, how I look now? How I look now? Tell me how I look now
How I look now? Bitch, look down

[Verse 1]
Okay she wobbledee, wobbledee
Drah-droppily, droppily
Got her legs in a angle, that shit

I got 80 carats on because I make
All that broccoli
Got her camera phone pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Dont you be poppin me
N-Now eay-eay, we hot, we hot
At the bar givin' away more shots

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
These hoes crazy
All their jackets should be straighted
And my nigga sold 'caine

Okay, she is from Venus
I bet I make it to Uranus
I mean, I, really dont give a fuck about
Your thinkers, okay now woah 'dere hold 'dere
Now, hold up them hoes there is on my whoa, there
Cause I'm luckily gettin' green up and down, left and right, I'm a fucking clover

B-Big tank rollay, horses in my motor

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I walk up in this bitch
Feelin like the fuckin' man

And make her fuck my mans
I'm who to fuck, if you fuckin' can
Fuck this dick ho, fuck as you plan
Fuck fuck fuck, you can fuck your friends
Hold up, I got another "fuck you" again
I'm a little off like a touch up
While you gettin' butt fucked
Jacking off to two girl shittin in one cup
I am with two girls, sippin on one cup
VIP and I got one truck, and
I got weed that'll cough yo lungs up
Forklift liftin' my nuts up, because
It's going, to be, a very, big nut bust
(SPLASH)

[Hook]



[Intro: Big Sean]
Do or die
Look, all I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
And when you feel something you can't see
But you know it's meant to be
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me yeah
Bigger than me, bigger than me
When the whole family depend on you to eat
And at night you can't sleep
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Get it, get it, get it
I pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha
I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture
Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister
I see myself in the young ones
When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror
Corleone all on my own (Don)
Cartier all on my arm
All I hear is sirens  and car alarms
Niggas going to war with no armor on
First time I seen a dead body I was 14
And I felt the pressure
Like if I don't get it, I might end up next to him
I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7
Seven, seven, seven, 7-11 it's 911 getting called around
The hood America's lost and found
Where niggas get lost and never found
All I ever wanted was to turn these Gs into Ms and a Mercedes key
Got it and I still felt incomplete
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Hook: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
You gon' realize that this was bigger than me

[Bridge: Starrah]
Used to want that foreign
Got that foreign, now it's boring
Started touring
Swear to God that's when I realized this shit was bigger than me
Flex on niggas with a Rollie
Got that Rollie with the shine
But lost my time
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I seen people in the same place 10 years later
Man that shit pathetic
God talking to me telepathic like it only happen if you let it
I can't spend my whole life looking at the same ceiling fan
When I feel like I ain't got no ceilings man
If I ain't special why I feel it then?
I gotta get on the road
I gotta be the one chose
I gotta come back and tell the greatest story they never told
This must be the feeling that you get when you know you close
And you know it's a way in even when the doors are closed
And realize this shit is bigger than me yeah

[Hook: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya

[Outro]
[Myra Anderson:] Well no matter what, I'm proud of you. Even when you do stupid things that I have warned you about. You must get that from your daddy. I'm just kidding, you know I love you. You listening?
[Big Sean:] Yeah yeah, I'm listening. I love you too
[Myra Anderson:] In a way I feel like I'm living through you. Sometimes it feels like I got another chance at everything
[Big Sean:] Man that's deep to feel like that. I kinda feel the same way though sometimes
[Myra Anderson:] Yeah
[Big Sean:] With all the work that's goin' on I feel like this is like my second time doin' it so I know that sound crazy but, you know I just I don't know why I always imagine myself as like someone who failed at everything he ever did at life you know and I got to the end of life and just regretted it all and somehow, this is my chance to go back and get it all right. And when I wake up, with that mindset, you know, it completely changes my hunger, how I approach the whole day. I mean you decide to live your life like that then pshh, man I guarantee we'll live life to our best potential
[Big Sean (future self):] It's that simple. It's all about living in the moment. Period

Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... look)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay mom mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)

Real one

Is you a real one?
Real one

[Hook]
I am in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The life, the love, the rights, the wrong
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!

[Verse 1]
And I'm in love with the lights, the love
Celebrity hoes, Hollywood parties that never get old
Table full of new hoes, champagne nuvo
My mind is on Venus, but my neck is on Pluto
I need a girl that look badder than my girlfriend
You know the ones that look badder than their girlfriends
Paparazzi try to pop Big since I'm in Cali
But I just hide my face doing a Errol Flynns
Hoody over my head, Jedi, Anakin
Looking like a BBC Louis V mannequin
She ain't got no man in em
She got no companion, she's Jenifer Aniston
I'm trying to hit her, and her friend
And again, and again
Pass it to my mans and them
Fucking all the baddest bitches in cities we're landing in!

[Hook]
What happens when it all falls
And the success is all gone
And is all gone?
But for now I'm a celebrity!
For now I'm a celebrity!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm in love with the money..
They say that it's the root of all evil
At least that's what the pastor tried to teach us
But he will pass around that collection plate
Til it's heavyweight as soon as his speech through
Then hop in that Benz coupe
Shit, I'm trying to get Benz too!
But how is it the root of all evil?
If it could take my whole family out to Rio?
No more repo
A depo, just speed boats
Jewelry all gold call me C3PO
Smoke so much, I gotta see 3PO
Cause I'm worldwide tour with me and my nigga Zeno
Most comfortable behind the mics like T.O
So I hate to lose my Mike like Tito

[Hook]

[Hook]

I do it for, everything in life for love and meaning
I hope they never try to tell me I'm leaving
Getting everything I want, then I've got my mom next
LA Reid sign checks right after the contract
I always have a crazy flow pockets was on radio
Active cause I guess I was active on a radio
Way back in high school, yeah nigga CT
Where I met my nigga Tone, Pat Piff, and CT
Came out of the slump nigga way before T3
Giving hoes the run around, we just call them track meet
It's funny now when I look back
Cause them times gave me the inspiration that the track needs



[Intro]
Yeah

Pokin' holes off in the condoms tryna have a baby ass (what?)
All up in Saks Fifth when you deserve Macy's ass (*scoffs*)
Talkin' bout "Shit, yeah nigga, better pay me" ass (bitch)
All up in my house and I ain't tryna room-mate her (mate her)
She in and out my drawers like it's, like it's Room Raiders (raider)
She crazy and deranged (yeah), when she in the Range (*car screech sound*)
Skip the jewelry store and grab rocks
Like she Tomb Raider (raider)
But before you hit that Alter and the preacher start pronouncin' (uh-huh)
Gave her half your heart but she got half of your amount (oh yeah)
Of whatever's in your account
So take that into account
And you best get to count-in'
Before you gets to bounc-in'
Bitch

Cuz crazy as she is I couldn't leave her if you paid me to
I swear I goes to work on that pussy like she paid me to
D-d-dick her up and now she walkin' like she 82
(I like the you you do it)
She get it from her mama
Headaches every night a nigga get it from the drama
Man if she don't make that money, she gon' take that money
Not from you?
Then she'll get it from Your Honor (your honor?)
Believe that, fuck you get my password?
Readin' through my emails and you ain't even ask first
I know I should leave her
For damn sure don't, don't need her
Every time I try and hit the door I always hit that ass first

[Hook]
(Man I should've known)
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muh-fucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
She was crazy than a muh-fucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muh-fucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
She was crazy than a muh-fucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
Do it!

[Intro]
Sean, it's good to be home, isn't it?
I see the skyscrapers in the back, this shit is official

[Verse 1]
I got a lot on my mind, I got more in my face
If I ain't going to get it that day is going to waste
I'm tryna move in my safe like the safe was a safehouse
I ain't going out to eat but these hoes stay on the stakeout
And you know it's official when I go bringing that BAPE out
I'm thumbing through the magazines like "This the girl Imma take out"
Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way-way out
And yeah, your music been bumping and you just waiting to break out
And I've been waiting all god damn year, oh yeah
I can tell that it's near but near ain't here
Man, them bills is here right now
I guess you shine brightest when the lights down like now
And then they say it happened for me overnight, shit yeah I guess
I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success
What you know 'bout living check to check to living check to check to check to check?
First place, no neck and neck
Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast
Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air
Yes, and I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese
Taking double shots like Siamese
I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like "Sign these"
I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees
I should've known back then I wasn't gon' stop
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top
I said, "I should've known back then, man, that I wasn't gon' stop"
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top

[Hook]
And I don't owe nobody in the world no favors
I started from the basement made it to the skyscrapers
I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on
I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on
Said, "I don't owe nobody in the world no favors"
I started from the basement made it to the skyscrapers
I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on
I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on

[Verse 2]
Bitch, watch how you speak to me
I've been working all week and I know I need ZZZZs
Tryna get paid repeatedly
Jamaica or Cancun, now that's where I need to be
Credit card used to be EBT, in the D though that's D-EBT
I've been thinking about becoming a cop
So I can murk some niggas one by one off legally
I talk that real shit, but that's why they loving it
One time for the city, treating it like it's the mothership
Was talking to my dad though on some other shit
He like "man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with
If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it
Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother"
But that's on some other shit, look
I'm into risk and taking it
I'm into making it then get back to making like I ain't made it yet
This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it
I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit
But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work
Even if you don't get paid for it
Shit, call me the greatest
Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour
Like thank you God, look at all we created
I started rapping Biggie Smalls in the basement
And now we headed to the tallest skyscrapers



[Intro: Big Sean]
Do or die, nigga
I'mma keep poppin' this Champagne
Don't worry about shit
Finally famous, nigga

[Hook: Big Sean]
Man, I look up to God, I wonder if I fell from the sky
Would I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly?
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man, I swear to God that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Man, I swear to God it get so deep though
That sometimes I  just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
See, I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
Got off in the game, don't need no cheat code
As long as I know the G code
Being paranoid done turned me to a creep
You ain't got that metal on your side
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep
Deep, deeper than telekinesis
Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
The deeper it gets, boy, the pressure increases
But pressure make diamonds
And my name is Sean cause I shine, it's self explanatory
I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories
You know the story
If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish Stone Cold it
My opponent probably praying for postponement
You fuck with the best rapper, don't even know it
It's written in the stars, man, the sky is the author
I pulled the sword out of the stone, I'm King Arthur
Motherfuck your armor, nigga, only weapon I'm scared of is Karma
You watching the son turn to father, fucking life and her daughter
Nigga, that shit just get deep

[Hook: Big Sean & Lil Wayne]
Man, I look up to God, I wonder if I fell from the sky
Would I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly?
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man, I swear to God that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep, deep

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Been going hard all day
Wish a nigga would fuck with me
Then I blow the candles out on my cake
And niggas always thinking it's a game
Til we ran them out the arcade
Stunting in my southernplayerlistic Cadillac, Andre
I talk that cash money shit
YM plus CMB, you can do the math for me, bitch
Jail time, a slap on the wrist
Cut your head off, get it mailed out, stamp on your lips
You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist
Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist
Well, tell them I'll be waiting in suspense
I got some miles on me, but it's cool cause I never give an inch
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
Cause this shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Like shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say that shit enough times
I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine
Is it because he ain't got the tattoos? He ain't throwing up signs
Well, let me throw up mine
And also let me show this vision of mine
Fuck the finish line, just finish your lines
And if getting your point across crosses the line
Some of the time then cross it with pride
That's real, my nigga, remember that
And it ain't about if they remember you, they remember rap
So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that
Cause this shit is deep, deep
Deep as empty pockets, nigga
We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets, slime
That shit get deep

[Hook: Big Sean & Lil Wayne]
Man, I look up to God, I wonder if I fell from the sky
Would I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly?
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep, deep
Man, I swear to God that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep, deep
That shit get deep, deep, deep
(Deep as empty pockets)
Deep, deep
(We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets)
Yeah, oh my god is just so deep, Yeah, yeah
(Deep as empty pockets)
(We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets)
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep



[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR & (Big Sean)]
Whoohohohohohohoho
Whoohohohohohohoho
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like
(Yeah)

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing tennis
Some girls are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don't play no games with hoes, I play Nintendo DS, nigga
And pray I don't see the end of my paper like P.S nigga
But damn in high school you had the fattest ass
And now we out of high school, you got a fatter ass
Swear I was just up on your Instagram a day or two ago
Seen your ass in deja vu, that shit was deja vu I know
Reminiscing on the one time we smashed in the back of the whip
And you gave me that head
I swear to God that was the best night of my life
I can't even sit here frontin', lie and pretend
Dancing with your titties out
I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah
But 5 minutes later you on my lap
And we just kickin' it like we're the only ones here
You're telling me how you went down South for school
Down near TSU
But you know business majors
You can't even get a job when you're comin' right out of the school
Told her check the Valley, seems like out there they be hiring
In L.A where all the girls that look like you are aspiring
A new scenery might just be inspiring
She said "Pshh, man everything ain't for everybody, shit I'm good"

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Okay I came up how I came up
A little change but I ain't change up
A little fame but I ain't famous
A little danger now I'm dangerous
Gettin' high now I'm the supplier now
Laying low cause it won't fade us
Still living how I'm living cause nigga I need to
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing tennis
Some hoes are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
She drop it for me, pussy pop it for me, take it to the top
Spending extra time when she ain't got it, on me
Then she turned around said
"I'm so proud, seems like everywhere I'm hearin' ya
Seems like yesterday you freestyled in the cafeteria
Tell me how it happened? Know this ain't the place to ask"
When she said that shit I had a flashback, back to the past
Man '07, LAX, first time in the baggage claim
Don C picked me up off the curb, my bags in hand
Was nervous as shit, knew I was meeting up with Ye
And we riding through the hills swerve, swervin' and shit
Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit
Oh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint
Hit the studio with Kanye, that shit was intense
And he said "Boy you got it, boy you is a prophet"
Signed me, got a profit
Few years later yeah we on and poppin'
And I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in
Brr Brr, call up Don C he was the first to know about it
Almost went to TSU with Alesha then I dropped it
Fuck it, I guess everything ain't for everybody
Oh boy, swerve

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Okay I came up how I came up
A little change but I ain't change up
A little fame but I ain't famous
A little danger now I'm dangerous
Gettin' high now I'm the supplier now
Laying low cause it won't fade us
Still living how I'm living cause nigga I need to
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it

You might as well have be a fat bitch
Boy I’m 'bout it, 'bout it
Getting sloppy toppy while I’m rolling kamikaze
Skeet, skeet, swear I made the pussy fire hydrant
She up and down the pole like she, like she firefighting
Bitch I’m Finally Famous, I do, I do what I want
Money, money, sex and money in the air with an aroma
Swear I got her head banging, banging, might be in a coma
Walk up to the baddest bitch and tell her that I own her

[Hook: Big Sean]
Baby do what you got to do, do what you got to do

Niggas pretending to be me, that shit don’t offend me

[Produced by No I.D.]

[Verse 1]
I know your tears more than you cause I see them so much
That's what happens when you're here with no trust
Okay, I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit and I'm still here right
And motherfuck your friends, all them hoes hating
If you're not down then what's your location
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from I love you to you don't know who you fucking with
Fresh off a vaca' and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
If you wanna leave fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me

[Verse 2]
Wishing I would've tried more, she wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more cause when I was true
All I heard was "bye" more, "fuck you"
"Who is that" and "I don't know why" more (Shut da fuck up)
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feeling like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hitting high notes and you ain't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'd up
Girls dressed alike looking like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinking damn boy grow up
And I could still hear her leaving
Crazy when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not working
Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
And if you wanna stay fine

[Hook]

[Outro]
So don't tell me you love me
Whatever you do whatever you do



[Hook: King Chip]
I'm feeling experimental
Just popped two now what have I gotten into
Trying to cope with all this shit I been through
These substances is fucking with my mental, my mental
I'm so experimental
Just popped two, now what have I gotten into
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking my mental

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
(Trippy niggas, trippy)
Big blunts of that kush, ducked off in that Phantom
Can’t no nigga do like me, this life I live outlandish
Bunch of hoes in my mansion, get trippy of them bars
I don't do no handcuffing; toss 'em to my dawgs
Bout' to start a bank, all this money that I make
Sour diesel smoking, Memphis nigga getting paid
Bunch of bad bitches, beggin' Juice to fuck
Drinking 'til I throw up, smoking 'til I'm stuck
Loud kush, you can hear it when I walk by
The room is moving side to side, I'm feeling hypnotized
Getting faded in the Phantom, ain't no stopping a riot
These niggas smoking dirt, actin' like they high

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
(Yup, yup, boi)
Rollin' weed while I'm sexin', rollin' weed while I drive
Rollin' weed while I'm rollin' weed, gettin' high when I'm high
I be gettin' high when I'm hot, gettin' high when you not
Gettin' high, on the low, gettin' high, oh my god!
I just ate a edible, edible
Swear to god I feel incredible
Swear that my texting is no longer legible
I got the pussy you put on the pedestal
Tell her to leave and come bring me back revenue
Gettin' paid down down down to the decimal
Medical vegetable, I'm so professional
My life's a fesitval, I'm just so messed up though - in the mental
I feel like I just jumped out the window
Rollin' OG, kush, purp and indo
Right here, outdoor, in the endo
Weed is my crescendo
Okay, so now we rollin', and she just popped her a pilly
Got her feeling all silly, rollin' paper from Philly, whoa

[Hook]

[Verse 3: King Chip]
She asking me questions even though she know I don't know
Her pussy the best and she give the best blowjobs on blow
She love the way that I dress and the way that I stroke
She said she never sipped lean, I said I never did coke
I'm good, I'm smokin', I'm leanin', I'm trying to stay focused
Got my loc's on the chieffin', hope these mollies ain't bogus
We got hoes in the front, got lean in the back
Gettin' head in the back, got fix in the 'Lac
Got Xannies on deck
Bitch, take these shots to the neck, we gots to connect
We off in this club, purple Sprites like it's nothing
Bitch just told me she ain't coming home with me less we fucking
And she got a friend, and they got some mans
Please don't mention yo nigga because I don't care about yo man
Now me and two hoes we on
Let's eat these shrooms 'til they gone
Now we having a threesome in the whip on the way home

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Chuck Inglish]
And it's falling off the side like back fat
Giving girls rides to the crib not a rat trap
Cheese, peanut butter freeze raps
I want all these snapped in his back in the day
Like a tall tee tag
I need that whip clean G
What's the weather gon be
Drop top, no drips on this upholstery
Supposed to be headed downtown
Carwash like blaow
And my girl drive the chevy while I break this tree down
Roll the window back up
Good, turn it back up
Ugh, UGK
Diamonds & Wood
Hold up, yea roll up
That's tight, that's right
You do this right, you might have the time of your life

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Coming from the Westside but my fitted say Sox
Where you get banged on if you in it or not
Looking like Cain cause I watch Menace a lot
And I'm tryna fuck your friend so is she with it or not
Shout out to ATL cause I'm in Lennox a lot
And I dont like looking, I go in there to cop
Houston High Rollers, I go in it a lot
Spending money with the strippers you go in there to watch
Blowin on L's, smelling like Chanel
You say you the man but dawg these bitches can't tell
But ladies love Dom cause I'm gettin that mail
To make it out my hood is like to make it out of jail
Put the tens up and start breaking out the twelves
Bet I have your girlfriend shaking out her heels
We shaking all deals
And chasing all meals
I'm popping all over how you haters all feel

[Big Sean]
Smoke good, fuck better
Count money, what's better
These lil niggas can't hang
Big shit popping bitch and big my first name
I'm a Westsider, Detroit player
Fuck around and I might bring back gators
Everyday I leave the crib with no money
And come back later with that muthafucking paper
Finally famous over erything thats just how I feel bitch
They trying to stop my shine
They yellin hit the kill switch
Wrong nigga to deal with
Less you doing a deal with
Grind hard, thats how I was built bitch
Whoa there, whoa there
I'm who everybody know here
I come through in the club and get more money than promoters
Oh thats your girl
I see her at my show there
I be off in the hood I bet you dont ever go there
Ayy so slow there boy
Don't go there boy
It's people you dont know there boy
Young nigga that's addicted to the Polaroids
And I gave these niggas more lines than corduroy
And my bitches be gorgeous boy
Showtime I hope you record em boy
I'm out here

[Boldy James]
Let's re-up half of a brick and bring it back to the kitchen
See the crack its fizzing
Then bring it back when its finished
Jimbo put that on a dish
And Chizzel will bag it and sell it
Then boldly factor the digits
To know the cash that I'm flipping
Six gonna get stashed in the ceiling
6-O's in traffic I'm pitching this o
That one get split and broke to halves
And this one his o
And that one is his
And this o I'm bagging and this one
This o the last
The nigga Ro is a crackilitician
Rolling the ave cause I'm getting dough in that slab
Cause I'm getting over, they mad
I just grill 'em bro, with my mag on my briches
Know I'll blast if you tempt him
Bro you will crash in your whip with holes in your back cause you hit
Going as fast as your engine go
When you smash in the strip smoking a bag with your bitch
Choking, gasping for breath holding
Grabbing your chest from boldly magging that tech
Unload it faster than Vick's concreture school craft to the the sick
Bomb as a brick

[Asher Roth]
I be frustrated with the way that shit's been aging
And I'm about to take a break and get away on a vacation
Like, maybe Malaysia to escape the meditation
I'll just eat, pray and wait for my day of revelation or I'll
Take peyote, roam the rivers of Nairobi
Change my name to Navajo and live alone and only grow weed
Cause this, Naomi flowing show gets pretty lonely
Don't nobody ever know you
Everybody call you homie
Mony Mony they'll be sure to treat you phony
As soon as you hit your low they won't be picking up the phone
See, I moved to (Comie ?) show these fools that I am home
And when Im on the microphone all you wanna-be's can blow me
So, take this boner to the dome you little bo-peeps
That may be inapropy but Im certainly no sheep
See, I only lead in this game of entertainment
Roth and Big Sean
We on Finally Famous

[Chip Tha Ripper]
Yea, now roll ten of em up
Fuck the rules we Auntie Anne's pretzel bendin em up
Don't give a fuck/Word to your daddy leather sandals
Either pay the light bill or light up them candles
Regular White Owl Cigarillo, no Flavors
Break that bitch down and peel of the first layer
Smooth, like a baby's ass
Mercedes pass
The ladies ask can they be next cause I'm kicking their favorite raps
Life is playing 2k and kicking raps all day by the lake
Smoking truth till I collapse in broad day
I'm surfing, radical
Gnarly, far out
My stoner chicks gather round soon as I break the jar out
Ay baby girl pass the blizz-ard
Your woman chose me so I had to jizz her
Don't be sleeping or taking no cat naps
We leaders of the new school with these fat raps



[Intro]
The best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches
I got the best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches
I got the best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches
And that's what you gon' get anytime you fuckin' with us
Finally Famous, what's up?

[Verse One]
I'm on the west side of my city
Ridin' round like a tour guide
With that white girl she got a tongue ring
That might as well be a bullseye
She half naked walking 'round this bitch
I almost thought I was poolside
Tryna raw dog my... (oh!)
Like her tubes tied but that's suicide!
One time for my niggas who made something out of nothing -
Cause you could lose it all my nigga look at David Ruffin
"You could lose it twice as fast as you got it"
Got it - that's what my grandma told me
And you've got to be a dumb dumb dumb motherfucker
Not to listen to what you hear from the OG's
Rollin' OG 'til I G-O
Yeah G-O, nigga, add an O-D
That's what I rep, nigga, 'til I O-D
Collecting everything that this world owes me
I told my Momma grab you any kind of car
Girl cause you my shining star, I love you everywhere you are
Back to it - to the game I am committed
My intentions: stay persistent
Workin' overtime like we get paid off commissions
And my wrist bliss, work
Ms. Gliss, man I ain't got time like my wristlit
No bitch fit, just a fit bitch
Who's only job is to make me feel terrific

[Hook]
Now we going strong, we'll be going going gone, 'til we on

[Verse Two]
I'm on the east side of my city
Ridin' round like it's "Doomsday"
And if you keep pushing my buttons
Might fuck around and be a "Tomb Day"
Don't let go of her hand
Or it might be "Big-Sean-In-Her-Womb Day"
"Congratulations, dog!" man, that's what the whole room say
I want money and security for all of my descendants
We up in Hollywood, tryna get our hands cemented
If you don't fuck with my songs
Man, you gotta fuck with the intention
Tryna get my fam and friends-es
Behind Benz-es, and cartier lenses - woah
I believe I can fly, I believe I'm the man
I believe in God
Man, they sending shots, shots, shots, shots
Like they don't believe I can die
Man, fuck whoever used to tell me to stop
A legend in the making -
Fuck whoever told me I'm not

[Hook]
Now we going strong, we'll be going going gone, 'til we on



[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Catch me running to the money until my feet lose feeling
Stack it wall-to-wall 'till it's leaking through the ceiling
Man, all fucking hundreds so whats that like a zillion?
Working graveyard shifts cause were finna make a killin'
Went from intern to the owner of the building
Bustin nuts counting money like: "Oh what a feeling!"
To be seeing what I'm seeing
After I've seen what I've seen
It's like acting out a scene from a dream of my dream
I got a dream that's worth more then my reality
And pride that's worth more than a salary
And a text from the girl I love I stopped calling
Quote: "I hope it's worth all it"
Sometimes I feel I'm working just to work harder
And then work harder then who worked the hardest
Man the life of a work-a-holic
You either on your work or just working on it

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Man fuck it kill'em all we gonna need a ton of flowers
And if you need impossible give me 'bout an hour
It's time to turn a Polaroid into a portrait
Rocking street clothes getting money like I'm corporate
Youngin' getting it isn't life gorgeous?
Bet the crib on 'em and you'll end up with a fortress
And Ima need that new condo, town home, brown stone
Should I fuck with the Dow Jones?
Or maybe I'll put money on the block instead
There's no need to save
I could get change off the street next to the meter maid
Cause I need a main house with a piece of shade
Butler doing such a good job that they need a raise
Bad chick with an Angel ass and an Aalyiah face
Tryna show a little TNA
Hell yeah I'm tryna see the day
Man, life is so bright when you don't see the grey
The new school appointed me to lead the way
A real nigga to the DNA
Me, Mike, Grace, and Dilla
Sticking to the script
And what's-her-name still licking on my tip
Go ahead and tell these bitches who they're fucking with
Man to get where I'm at I'll make her suck a hundred dicks
Man to get where I'm at I'll make her suck a hundred dicks
Her mouth lookin like Dannon
Because of me and Cannon
And to get where we at she had to suck a hundred dicks

[Outro: Big Sean & Don Cannon]
Man I got on Versace shades, Versace belt, Versace shoes
I might've fucked around and been the freshest nigga in the world today
You dont understand man I came from nothing
This what I dreamed about, this what we dreamed about..boyyy
B.I.G. Sean Don nigga, G.O.O.D. Music
Finally Famous in this bitch.. Errything...Detroit what up though?
Ayo Big, Motherfuckers always askin' me like:
When you gonna lend somebody else eat
When you gonna pass the baton on to somebody?
My response is: Fuck I look like Carl Lewis?
I feel like Usain Bolt, I got it running these streets
Who else do it better than me?
So you can cut all the chit chat out right now and just know one thing:
We're finally famous motherfucker

Tell 'em that I need more
Fire (22x)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it
Dealt with real life shit, manned up and got through it
I'm a real D-Boy, take a look up in my face
Never did real estate, and still put you in your place
I don't trust dog hoes, dog hoes got fleas
From where they rock ski-masks and don't nobody ski
Every time I spit a verse, my city like "Preach!"
Niggas thought I got evicted how my shit up in the streets
B-I-G Sean, ain't nothing obese, but the feast
Swear I'm skinny cause I'm always on my feet
Gotta hustle every second, stacking paper every week
Boy I'm in the field for real, I might run up in some cleats
Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak, had to leave
Back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speak in Trapanese
If I fall down, bet I only trampoline, bounce back
Back on my feet, that's just how I be
I be out of town repping valid as an absentee
Lord G's, jealous motherfuckers trying to absent me
Fuck these niggas up, now it's absent teeth
Trying to pass on me, when I'm first place in the Playoffs bitch
I'm even working half days on my day off bitch
Say it's gon kill me fuck it, I work graveyard shifts
'Long as that weed and money chilling in the pile
Bitch, I need that fucking fire

[Hook]
Tell 'em that I need more
Fire (22x)

[Bridge]
Right now, right now, right now
I know it's been a long, long
It's been a long, long time
A long time, I know it's been a long, long time

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it
Can do anything in the world except not do it
Bought my fam new land, six star crib
Momma feeling like she Jewish, I'm the motherfucking truest
Yeah I talk about my mom, but shoutout to my dad
Would drive me to school every single chance he had
Tell me 'bout the crazy girls and all about his past
And gave me the talks that made me to a man
Not everybody got a dad but they got a Uncle Sam
And he ain't came around till I made a 100 grand
Coming from Detroit where everybody say "what up doe?"
Horror movie shit, cause everybody there cut throat
Watch who you hustle with you might not get a cut though
Even though you deserved a commission plus mo
And grandma sad when she saw my commercial
"Stop having people at your shows that wasn't at rehearsals"
I’m tryna to get a office at the Empire State
To bring it back to empire's plate, that's home
Man, I'm reppin' for my entire state
Prayin' that I won't be late
When it's all finished at the endin', after all bottles spillin'
Throttle gripping, models switching, chin chilling in my villa
Fucking like I tryna populate a village, I'm replenished
I didn't do it just for the money, man, for the feeling
I made it through the...

[Hook]
Tell 'em that I need more
Fire (22x)

[Bridge]
Right now, right now, right now
I know it's been a long, long
It's been a long, long time
A long time, I know it's been a long, long time

[Outro: Big Sean, James Fauntleroy, & Nicole Lequerica]
But it's never, never been too late
It's never, never been too late
It's never, never been too late
It's never ever been too late
Right now, right now
I know it's been a long
I know it's been a long, long time
Just know that it's never, never been to late
It's never, never been too late
It's never ever been too late
It's never ever been too late
Do what you wanna do
Fuck everything else

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes
Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
Used to pick me up from school, man, right after work
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church
She asked why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
Now I'm in the penthouse, look at what a mill do
Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you

[Hook]
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Bridge]
BIG was the first one that had it
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Verse 2: Nas]
What's the noise all about with this rap stuff?
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up
I can say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
Cause it's a mental game
I learned that when I got my first initial chain
I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'
To those dealing with blow, had the big gold, bold anchors it was those gangsters
That bonus, that culture, those projects
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint
They got in my bones, now I'm copping stones
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold Cuban on
Not too short, not too wide, not too long
My pendant offensive, in the truest form
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?

[Hook]
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Bridge]
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what way I turn things go my way
I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave
Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying
I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
Police only work 12-hour shifts
Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch
Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues
FF, GOOD, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews
Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta
Need a doctor, I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days
It's like I got a built-in doppler
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain

[Hook]
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Bridge]
Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Verse 4: Kid Cudi]
It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
Niggas and bitches, where you at?
I got my mind is on me, a couple others and dreams
Would've seen me and my niggas in this bitch
About two months in a week's time
Went from feelin hellish to godly with lemon-lime shine
Now how the fuck can I chill now? Kanye think I'm dope
See this piece that I own now, how sick is the rope?
Taking life for what it is, the troublesome chick
Who throws fists; sometimes it's the weather
Things switch up, people trip up
The money come down, then climb up, but when it come again
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
Saying that you love me, I surely hope and if you don't
Motherfuck that sometimes, so dead it
Shred it; young nigga lost to the night
I'm so ready to let it go, my life is fucking awesome
I could be fuckin' dead right now but I'm awesome
So fuck whoever has a bad thought don't know the god
Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God
It might be too late, but the songs will live on
Just know this fact, you were all wrong
Now watch me do my silly dance, not really a dance
More like a prance - I'm signing off with a crotch grab

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Thank you man. for letting me get on this record Sean
You the coolest
GOOD music nigga forever
Understand? Yahm



Goddamn you got a lot of meat hangin' there (mmm)
You're kinda large
But when I look at a big, black, shiny, greasy dick like that (yeah)
My pussy almost jump out my drawers ooh shit
Ooh shit I can't wait (oh fuck yeah)
Oh I wanna sippy the straw that motherfucker (ooh)
Ooh please let me enjoy this good big dick while it's here (oh my God)
Ooh I wanna ride this big pig
Ooh I wanna put the dogs on the head of this good motherfucker
Ooh now look at here baby
If the jaws of my pussy start to grippin' (mhm)
Don't pay that no mind, it's just that my pussy done got nervous
And a dick like that will make any pussy excited
Ooh shit, I could take a little bit more of this good motherfucker (oh my God, oh God, oh shit)
Baby, oh (oh, oh, oh sh-)



[Hook: Big Sean]
Motherfuck my opponent, started with a vision and a nigga got on it
Met success and a introduced it to my homies, now every single girl in the room gon want us
(x2)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Hell yeah I hope they hearing us
Imma want the beef, broccoli, and asparagus
Tell them rich folks they can couple up a chair with us
They can sure brag , but I know they can't embarrass us
And motherfuck the opposition (fuck) your bitch wanna make a proposition
Remember when a nigga barely had a pot to piss in, now I'm on my paper
Mr. Composition (what, what?) Excuse me, What? Competition? What?
To me that word is non- existent
And he sound like uhhhhhhh
Quit comparing me bitch
Fuck you with a Ron Jeremy dick
Hell yeah I'm apparently pissed, sonnin' niggas
I could give a parenting tip, I'm too good to really care about shit
Cause I'm young with money like I inherited it, biotchh

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Tyga]

Get a buzz, champagne and club in the dusk
Wonder on top of the drums before the ambiance
Trying to get the sun involved, reflect on these hoes
No mirrors, my vision is simply through carrera gold
What's your goals when your interests ain't the (?)
Synopsis flow
I give it as the story go
Legion of Doom the superheroes have entered the room
Everyone move, everyone move, except for the Betty Boops
I'm Coming for you
Reservation at pussy pool, let's make it for two
Amateur addict get this long dick stamina
IChat the camera
Screw faced and hammer her
Can't touch it if it's funk
That R&B and bitches say they won't
Hip-hop around '94 'til my soul (?)
Ante up, like M.O.P., fuck your thoughts
It's GED, Young Money until the casket drop

[Hook] (x2)

Motherfuck my opponent (x2)

[Intro: Big Pharrell]
Yo! It's money time, nigga!
Yezzir, whoa yeah, hey

[Hook: Pharrell]
I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard for the shuttle
All the hoes!
They screaming "Oh-oh!
Lil nigga go!
Go for the gold!"

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay, "B-I, B-I", bitch I do it to death
If I come with half, bet I leave with the rest
Okay, you might be cool getting 50%
I'm like "fuck you doing? I need Diddy percent!"
Got a million on line 1 and another mil' dialing in
Momma on line 4, telling me how much not to spend
'Ye on line 3 telling me how we 'bout to win
You on hold tryna get conferenced in
I ju- I just gotta have it
Imagine and make it happen, I prayed about it and grabbed it
My life is a fucking movie, the baddest bitches get casted
I'm in a race with myself to see who could get it the fastest
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check with no ink
I get it

[Hook: Pharrell]
I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground

[Post-Hook: Pharrell]
Hey! Get it, get it, nigga we can get it
Get it, get it, nigga you can get it
Get it, get it, nigga I can get it
Yea, yea, my nigga we can get it, let's go

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Whoa! The sky never seemed so low
Looking at her like "you never seemed so close"
I had a dream about a trillion in cash
It's time to make it happen!
I'm back to dreaming what you can't imagine
Talking cash, you gotta fake an accent
I've broke enough tree down that I could make a cabin
Look: I turn all my problems to ash
All my wants into haves and then divided it by half
Pass it on to my man, write my will out then
Pass it on to my fam and finally become a man
I had a dream I was greatest of all time
Greatest of all Bigs, greatest of all Seans
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check with no ink
I get it

[Hook: Pharrell]
I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard the shuttle
All the hoes!
They screaming "Oh-oh!
Lil nigga go!
Go for the gold!"

[Post-Hook: Pharrell]
Hey! Get it, get it, nigga we can get it
Get it, get it, nigga you can get it
Get it, get it, nigga I can get it
Yea, yea, my nigga we can get it, let's go



[Intro: Big Sean]
God, oh, God

I'm 'bout to spend it all on me, I'm worth it

[Bridge: Big Sean (Kanye West)]
Hol' up, tell me what you see
Pull up, watch these motherfuckers freak
Why don't ya say waddup though when you see me in the streets
(G.O.O.D. Music in this bitch now drop that motherfuckin beat)

[Hook: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that seeing me gettin' guap right now
Seeing me gettin' guap right now, seeing me gettin' guap right now
This to all of my hatin' hoes that seeing me gettin' guap right now
Seeing me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
This to all my old hoes that seeing me gettin' guap right now
Seeing me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
Seeing me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, I won't stop right now
Hell nah, I won't stop right now, seeing me gettin' guap right now

[Verse 1]
Okay, I need 50k large (right now)
My momma need a new crib (right now)
My daddy need a new car (right now)
So I be goin' so hard (right now)
Detroit is my yard (right now)
I need a 17 car garage (right now)
I need a 17 broad menage (right now)
I need a jail house to free my dogs (right now)
I done paid taxes, paid dues, paid bills my whole life
So I'mma throw money in the air, like I'm tryin' to pay the sky
Told myself that man if I can't live like this, I'd rather die
I give it up to God, and he always replies:
"Control yo' hoes, you let her talk till you crazy
You got baby mama drama, you ain't even got you no baby!
You fugazi, b-boss up, boss up with your time dog
You ain't got time for no hoes, I ain't even got time for no time off!"
I'm on

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay, I need 50k large (right now)
My homie just beat the charge (right now)
My brother need a new job (right now)
So I be goin' so hard (right now)
I need my face on a black card (right now)
My iPhone need a charge (right now)
My fish tank need sharks (right now)
I need a blimp to say the worlds ours (right now)
So these niggas can know I do what they can't
I'm stuntin' for all the people who ain't
You still hatin'? You should be fuckin' ashamed
Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Yeah, I know, but I don't get my stress on
Takin' shots, swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like, "Boy, won't you get your rest on?"
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Chandon sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it till it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Outro]
Right now, whoa (x6)
This to all my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, won't stop right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, won't stop right now
Hell nah, won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now



[Intro]
I am ready right now
Uh huh
I look up I don't even know no more
I think it's funny how it go down
I don't even know no more, official shit

[Hook]
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

[Verse 1]
I'm the livin' proof
That you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed
My daddy tell me, "Stay strong, son
And be the man you have to be
Holdin' ship down, don't crash at sea"
Brrrt! Paper on my phone line
It's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me
But I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically
'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually
So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'ma text the room number right now
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
Don't ask for me, don't ask for me
Don't ask for me
Lot of shit been goin' on, things goin' wrong
So don't ask for me

[Hook]
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

[Verse 2]
She been mad, I've been on the go, on the road
On a roll more than a roller coaster
They can't throw me off track or slow
If I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes
That quote on quote, say I told you so
Heaven on earth, every night is paradise
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that
I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s
Still smokin' at 5:20 like it's 4:20
On a quest for more money, more hungry
Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'
Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'
Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'
In my city I'm Warren Buffett
I mean business, the shirt is tucked in
The gun's tungsten, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with
Who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with
My stock's risin', I'm goin' public, if I write it, it's gon' publish
You're fuckin' with the best, no discussion

[Interlude]
So disgusting
It's that 3 and a third shit
Straight up

[Hook]
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me
She been mad

[Outro]
Elder Big Sean: I think you should answer...
Man: Yo, yo your mom callin' you
Big Sean: Um, I'ma call her back
Man: You sure dawg? She keep callin'
Big Sean: Yeah for sure, for sure, bruh, I'ma call her back

[Bridge - Sean]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

[Verse 1 - Sean]
And I wish that this could last forever
But maybe one night is even better
Real nigga mayne, all the people I plotted with
Is the same ones I'm dividin' the profits with
Now I'm in the building like two planes bitch
Kickin' it with my shirt off, on some Liu Kang shit
Sleep with the sun up like I grew fangs bitch
I come alive in the night, on some Bruce Wayne shit
Livin' my life, gettin' high payments
Fuckin' with some new broads and they high maintenance
And they wearin' high heels, trip so we're on high hills
Tits sittin' high, rollin' zips, gettin' high man

[Hook - Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high
It's time to go

[Bridge - Sean]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

[Verse 2 - Sean]
Cause the penthouse 90 floors up
Make love and then join the mile high club
Yeah I'm on camera, fresh out of a sex scene
I just turn all my nightmares into wet dreams
I'm in a new crib, so big, I'm talkin' town size
Sippin' somethin' cold, smokin' weed by the pound size
Yeah I gotta big head ho, I think it's crown size
Bitch I do it big and I never plan to downsize
People who talk shit, is feelin' like dickheads
Saw me on the web like I had a extra six legs
Lookin' at my highlights with a bitch with highlights
Crowd wavin' at me, all tryna say hi right

[Hook - Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high
It's time to go

[Verse 3 - Wiz Khalifa]
If you roll one up, I'mma roll one too
Oh you sayin' you don't smoke? Well that's all that we do
You be up in the club, I be up in the clouds
Ooh, don't gotta ask me if I brought enough cause' we don't run out
Blow it by the O, even my fans smoke it
Cause' they throw it at my shows hidin' it when I travel
In case the police gotta know, rollin' it up in traffic
Make you smoke out of a bong, put you on different hashes
My chick is the baddest, my spliff is the fattest, I'm livin' so lavish
Gotta patch a lil kid tryna get at this cabbage
My pinky ring a V8, I filled it with carrots
I'm popeye with spinach, till' the day I die I'm gettin' high

[Hook - Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high
It's time to go

[Bridge - Sean]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

[Verse 4 - Chiddy Bang]
I'm fly, my swell on Priceline
Truthfully I want this shit to last a lifetime
Simply amazing, we blazin' as we just write rhymes
Cold flow, ice time, breakin' down bright pines
Enough with all the beefin' I'm over it
Outta town kush, but they smokin' that local shit
I always knew that I would be the man
They ride the greyhound, but I'm more a peter pan, we the fam
Off the scale, yeah we about to break the richter quick
Loud, yea it's worth a thousand words on some picture shit
When it comes to smokin' we have a certificate
I know them haters is wishin' we fakin', licorice
Fuck it we up, my nigga Sean gave me another L
I need a high class chick that I match up with well
She familiar with Fendi, comfortable in Chanel
And you know errthang' high when you livin' swell

[Hook - Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high
It's time to go



Man I got my dark glasses on, cause I'm ready for the big lights
All my money counted, all my rubbers skintight
Me, I always fit out, you was more the in type
I never follow suit, you was more like pinstripes
Riding in Ye's Maybach, smoking so it's cloudy
With three girls who spent all day doing Pilates
Getting money, niggas think I joined illuminati
Throwing west side up, I'm feeling like Killuminati
Now isn't it ironic that I'm in a big body
Paranoid cause every rapper named Big got bodied, boy
And my bitch got body
But I sit her in the back, cause my nigga called shotty!
And I'mma G-O till I'm a OG
Rocking something high end, like a fucking OD
They feel a nigga from NY to the OC
If we down in the 4th quarter, I take it to OT
Take it to 1 and 0, just take it it's on me
Chilling in the hot spot cause I never get cold feet
Nigga, you on the sidelines praying for an audible
Cause when you're legendary everything is quotable
Priceless is affordable, order what you can't afford
Matter fact, order more
And I think I'mma have the same thing
My whole team getting cash, I just call it gangrene
Big is on the track, Ye be on the track
Since when Kobe and LeBron hoop for the same team
Could live my life blindfold
Cause every time my eyes close
I just tend to fuck around and see the same thing
Yeah, I just tend to see the same thing
They say it's meant to be when you sleep to the same dream
I hooked up with GOOD, and been living a changed scene
I'm trying to turn these gray clouds to Vanilla Skies
Camera in my face, I guess the future will be televised
And I'm as underrated as can be, bitch
Fuck it if I'm underrated, I stay on some G shit
Nigga, I chief up, it's December 25
Three hundred and sixty-five, forever puttin' reef up
And your girlfriend forever want to meet her
Tryna see what is in common but my dick is what's between us
Man I break her heart every time I change hoes
I make a new style every time I change clothes
Man they jock my rhymes every time I change flows
One of the few getting change but won't change for it



[Verse]
My, my, my, as the world turns
Today if I don’t earn, best believe I’m gon’ learn
If I can’t do either or, shit it’s none of my concern
Watch my enemies burn as I f-fill every urn, ah
Reminiscing on the rappers I would look up to
The ones who want my feature price and the hookup too
The girls I fantasized about tryna hookup too
Niggas seven feet, telling me I’m who they look up to
Huh, and bitches still telling me to grow up
Don’t invite ‘em to my shows but always still manage to show up
Man, I made myself a boss and then I gave me a promotion
And I step inside the booth and change the world like I be voting
So when you step inside my office, treat that bitch like it’s the Oval
El presidente, lord, sensei
Do ya job, it could be pay your rent day, getting riskay
Crazy nigga, they ain’t seen it like this since ‘Ye, yea
Well this the life that I live
Collecting everything overdue, for all the work that I overdid
D-Town but Chi-Town they love me like I’m Oprah kid
Tryna make it to the top so I can let my dogs know it exist
‘Cause when you come from the bottom man it’s so hard to just get a glimpse
So hard to get a glimpse, so while I’m here I might take a pic
And show ‘em that it’s more to the world than tryna make a living
Like changing it then looking back and saying that we did it
Okay, como me llamo
She say Ingles, no hablo, man, unless it’s eat me out though
Benihana, my McDonald, all black leather jackets
While I ride in my Diablo, swear I feel like I’m Keanu
Wishing Lamborghinis made a five do’
‘Cause I got too many real mufuckas I ride for, die for, uh
Straight out the metropolitan
My city need a hero so I treat it like Metropolis
And it’s a few bad Lois Lanes I can’t name
Even though I’m me, Lord knows that I can’t save
But I’m still the same me, same clique, the same hood, the same bitch
I came up, my bank up, but I stack that like I ain’t rich
Back when we was on college tours with Wale, man we ain’t make shit
From Greensboro to SoCal, man all the way back to Cambridge
And Michigan State, close to my Michigan estate
Man we was trying to get away, man we was trying to get ordained
And damn (and damn), tomorrow never seemed so close
And life ain’t what it seem no mo’ (no mo’)
‘Til I was standing next to Puff and Hov, off the French coast
A million dollars never seemed so broke
And every bitch I’m fucking praying they the one I settle with
And niggas suing me and they just banking on the settlement
Never settling, life is too fast just to settle in
So many rocks up in my bezel, police thought embezzlement like damn!



[Intro: Big Sean]
Finally Famous, nigga
West side, East side, South side, North side
D-town
Put on put on
The city, the city
I like it in the city
The city, the city
I like it in the city
The city, the city
I like it in the city
Boy, boy
I do it
D-town you already know
Can you say D-Town
Six Mile, Seven Mile, Eight Mile
West side nigga
Chalmers East Side you know
East side what up though
You see downtown
Jefferson, Dexter
Joy Road
My city getting paid
You would have thought we had the same zodiac sign as Ben Franklin nigga

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I come from a city
When 9/11 dialed up, everybody riled up hundred gun pile up
They lay it on the line, make sure you don't get file up
Hammer in and out of court, nigga don't get trialled up
I'm chasing cheese, dodging rat traps
Chasing pussy, you might end up with a Kat Stacks
I'm outtie like a hatchback
For them whole and half stacks
Trying to make at least half back, nigga af-tax
D-town I honor ya, they hearts drop when they see me on tall monitors
Blasting my city that's your ass in my city
Need a pass in my city
And I'm mr. hall monitor in my

[Outro]
The city the city I like it in the city



[Intro]
Cool cool cool cool
Yup, finally famous nigga

[Hook]
Ok, I get lost in the night
Faded off of that brown
We can take shots of that white
Realest niggas around
Tell me would you like it, would you like it if I let you call me Big
Take it to the D, I can show you where I live
Take it to the penthouse and show you how to live
And treat it like it ain't shit

Now ask me how it feel
How it feel, how it feel
How it feel, how it feel
Yea tell me how it feel, how it feel, how it feel
Man, to be around a nigga this real
You know I came up, came down
Turn every dream I had real
So tell me how it feel
How it feel, how it feel
Man to be around a nigga this real

[Verse 1]
You know I need everything in plural
That's benji's and euro's
I just came back from that Paris
My life is moving in turbo
My pinky ring just dingling
Look how I'm sipping my merlot
Look how I'm hittin' my herbal
Praise God, church ho
What the fuck is you saying?
B.I.G, I'm the mayor in the bitch
Ol' fur coat looking like a bear in this bitch
OH! fuck is you wearing? that's embarrassin shit
Man and to my new girls that's hearing this shit
You fucking with an OG, you should cherish this shit
Man they tell me that they love me, I ain't hearing that shit
They trynna get up in my will and inherit that shit
That's why I'm faded, I'm wasted
I'm living life like it's no jail
House bigger than a hotel
But these hoes tell
So I still take their ass to the hotel
And my ho tell
I got a bad bitch with that body
And a badder bitch in that lobby
Boy that's just how I got it
When I..

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bad bitches that came through
I'm hitting all that I aim to
So stoned I can't move
So stoned I can't move
She go either way like it's game two
She look at her phone praying it ain't you
Living out all the rumors
Then afterwards, say it ain't true
Man I'm daydreaming while sexing
Her screams remind me I'm in it
And all this champagne that I'm popping
Reminded me that I'm winning
I know we shouldn't get so high
Yea, remind me that when I'm finished
But this the life we chose
It's the only life that we know
Reminiscing when I had no job
Back when I woulda robbed yo job
Me and my niggas on the streets dog
Throwing signs up like we roadside
Now the suits and pasta both bowtie
My Greek girls scream "opa"
My Spanish girls scream "no más"
And all the Black girls scream "don't stop!"

[Hook]

[Intro]
I do it
Fuck yo time, nigga
I do it, boi
Nigga fuck yo time nigga

[Verse 1]
I waited my whole life to be the man of the hour, I really can’t lie
I was the man when I started, I'll be the man when I die
Man these hoes, take your money and I take they virginity
I’m high, I split an O in half, now it’s a parenthesis
Crazier than crazy, ape shit, retardedly stupid
I put that weed in the air and pass it, yep, that's alley-oopin
Okay now, oh that's yo girl? Well I don’t give a mass of two shits
Okay I’m west side, west side 'til I’m died and underneath them tulips
You bordo like Enrique, I’m too paid, I’m three-paid
I’m looking like I’mma sweep stakes but I treat ya girl like a cheap skate
Cause I need a crib, a big estate, I need a boat and that need a lake
I need some salmon, that need a plate that need a chef so I feed my safe
My crew is who I’d be widdidy-wid-it, Rose I sippity-sip-it
I’m Quagmire I fuck hoes, my cashflow I "giggity-get" it
Boy, I’m cock-a-mamian, the most zaniest, insaniant
Pulling up in Merced-iance (Ballin'), rolling up like I’m Damian (Marley)
I love girls that Arabian, Albanian, Caucasian
I ride around gettin cranium cause my dick is hard as titanium
Oh boy you had your chance and blew it (You blew it)
Stand aside and watch a real nigga do it, bitch

[Hook]
I feel like the world mine
Just bow down, the world mine
I’mma let you live, the world mine
This world mine

[Verse 2]
The one and only in this mothafucka
Niggas staring like we the only ones in this mothafucka
How could you not know we in this mothafucka
I got my haters looking lonely in this mothafucka
Whoa, I’m sipping on whatever I get handed
Throwing house parties so crazy that my crib look like a campus
Play your cards right and I could blow you up nah, I ain't gambit
Shit, I’m wasted-wasted, this looks like a job for Captain Planet
Nah-nah, good lordy, whoadie, I just took more shots than Kobe
The realest niggas is reppin, the baddest bitches promoting
She put that thong on my groin-groin and then it go boing!
Got my fronter on her bumper does it look like she towing
I hustle hard like I’m finna lose the crib
And party hard like I’m finna do it big
All I ever do is big, so all she wanna do is Big
Girl, what your name is, I really can’t remember
And Tone breaking tree down, somebody yell out timber
I’m up up in them Kush clouds, lighting up like I’m Zeus
Bitch stand back watch how a real nigga do it

[Hook]
I feel like the world mine
Just bow down, the world mine
I’mma let you live, the world mine
This world mine

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
Uh, fuck, I don't fuck with you
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

[Hook: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit, like, "I don't fuck with you."
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and everyday I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

[Hook: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean + (E-40)]
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

[Hook: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin', like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me, like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you (Straight up)

(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Hook: Big Sean]
I know you've been goin' through some things, uh-huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get, bust it wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
Yeah, I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
Uh-huh, I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes
That y'all don't speak the same language
Uh-huh, I know that you just wanna let it go
With all the bitches that you came with

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been going through some thangs
Wanna get away, baby, let me be your vacation
That other trick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin', baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space, we can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

[Bridge: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing but no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands

[Hook: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main thing that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know you goin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
I know you, I know you
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Outro]
I know it look like like you need a vacation
How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia
Take you places other niggas can't take ya
Don't forget the make up, yeah

Count money that these bitch ass motherfuckers
Said I wasn't gonna see, gonna see
Cause I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be

If you want to go it's a wonderful ride
Where there's no limit, no sky
Well alright, alright

[Hook: Big Sean + Jhene Aiko]
I'm gonna be everything I wanna be
So I'm gonna be what I wanna be

[Outro: Big Sean]
Yep, ay, I told my...



[Hook]
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong (this one's for you, you, you)
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me (you, you, you)

[Verse 1]
You tried to keep me away from temptation
Introduced me to The Temptations
Marvin Gaye and Isley Brothers
Dancing so hard the living room shaking
Yeah we dance in the house
My mama's the man of the house
Mama you too good for them men
Even dad, you too good for him
Mama you know you inspire me
You deserve early retirement
You text me, tell me to take my vitamins
When I got a new love you invite 'em in
When we break up, you don't like 'em then (no)
Loyal, loyal, swear you super loyal
Worth more to me than striking oil
You deserve the life I'm tryna show ya
I remember all of the sacrifices
Growing up in debt, but never hungry
Rich in everything except money
That's that faith that you can't buy
But I buy that new crib, you look right in it
I buy that new car in the color that you like it in
And play my song every single time you drive in it
That's 'cause you inspired it (yeah)

[Hook]
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me

[Verse 2]
I know it's hard to get me on the line
I'm busy like every other time
Since I got a house in that other town
You wonder when I'ma come around
I know you worry about me
I give you attitude like, "Don't worry 'bout it"
Don't hit ya up like I don't care about you
But I hold you down, I swear I got you
I know I got problems communicating
I probably should've went to school
And got that degree in communications
I should be with you on vacation
I should take you where you should be taken
Asia, Africa, Dubai, anything you want, I do buy
Just want you to know I do try
To take care of ya, mama you the one, you the one
You the moon, you the stars, you the sun
I'm so happy I'm your son
I'm so happy I'm your son
You love me since day one
Since before day one
So before the day's done
I gotta, gotta let you know

[Hook]
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me


[Outro]
Look, mama, you know you inspire me
If I ever made you not feel like it, then this is my apology
So sorry, look, dear mama you know your son shine for ya
I'm Sean for ya, my lady
Don't you ever let 'em talk to you crazy
Anything for the fam, how you raise me
I'm yo baby but you still my baby
Ayy



God, I have been doing the same thing in the same place, working the same job for 45 years. You know that. Shit just flew by. What am I really even doing? God, I know we rarely talk, but every day I wake up I feel like, I feel like I blew it with my family, with her. These kids around me don't have no one to look up to. Should have been me. This job ain't me, man. This ain't what I'm supposed to be doing in my life, man



[Verse]
I say
I'm still dreaming bigger than I'm living
And just sleeping long enough to dream
Spent long enough in the sheets
It's time to turn it to the real thing
And turn these ideas to milli's
Business into buildings
No girlfriend, you're looking for some feelings
Find a dentist
Me and my crew toured around the world
Shook a million hands
I never made the crowd fans
I made 'em all fam
And came back to the city
That made us all men
Except we kings now
Reflecting, trying to take it all in
I put the city on my back
So that way if I fall
I'm crowd surfing the map
I turn mistakes into lessons
Dead ends to exits
On the journey of my life
So I'm inviting ya'll to get in
Let's go



[Intro: Big Sean]
I done fell asleep fucking last night
That’s how much I don’t sleep nigga
Finally famous nigga

[Hook: Big Sean] x 2
And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)
Let’s get it

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Today is a good day
I wish a nigga would day
Ride through the hood day
Ride through the hood where I would stay
If I wasn’t me, wasn’t committed
I told my mom and my dad it’ll be the last Christmas
In the hood that you can visit
Oh boy I got it, no chasers
Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems
I took that advice young when I was headed up to college
Momma swimming in that debt
Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark
Ready set go, on your mark to the top
Getting rich ain’t a blessing it’s a choice
Drunk and still drinking out the fucking bottle
I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model
You ain't alive if you ain't living that’s the motto
And imma’ probably wake up tomorrow sayin, sayin

[Hook: Big Sean] x 2
And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)
Let’s get it

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Lets get it, yeah be alright nigga
It’s the motherfucking world nigga
Getcha some time to just do it how I done it
First up on the first cause’ first of all you gotta want it
Re-up time for every penny, never fronted
Showroom floor, paid every penny then I stunted
Stunted so hard you woulda thought I was a stuntman
TS4 with 23’s I’m talking jumpmans
Twos and thirds watch for the blitz, you know they rush
Just don’t get caught in the coupe with them birds, end of discussion
Them boys round the corner wanna sell in that Cal Ripken
If them niggas think I’m riding with that, them niggas tripping
Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, cause’ imma’ grinder
Told my O's, "I'm hiding you here, so they won’t find you"
What you know about a bag that’s heavy as anacondas?
Bet you one thing, I ain’t talking no marijuana
That’s whats wrong with these niggas they think it’s about shine
You niggas get back to your grind, I think it’s about time

[Hook: Big Sean] x 2
And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)
Let’s get it

[Verse 3: Payroll]
They say it’s my time according to my Rolex
I’m bout to fuck the game, then your ho next
I used to talk dirty on my cell, no phone sex
No yoga boy I was making blow stretch
Press the fast forward button, I’m pushing a foreign something
All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood
My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good
I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good
It’s time for a new crib, it’s time for a new chain
20 thousand on me homie that’s just loose change
Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess
But if you knew bout my hood you’d say that nigga is blessed
Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro?
Getting money four ways so I can buy a two-door
Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though
The hustle’s who I represent, Dough Boyz we in this bitch

[Hook: Big Sean] x 2
And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t
Put the city on let’s get it
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)
Let’s get it

[Outro: Lawrence Lamont]
Detroit, once the backbone of this country
Now it’s the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy
Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant
Going from a population of nearly 2 million
To under 700,000 in a matter of years
The people of Detroit really going to have to stick together
To make it through these tough times



[Chorus: Big Sean & Jeremih]
I think I’m ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I’m ready to jump out the window

[Verse 1]
Straight up, straight up, look
Know ya momma didn’t raise you to take no disrespect, yeah
I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check, yeah
You cried on my phone the whole night
That time he crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh I was there) I went to straighten his ass out
And you told me never mind yeah, yeah, yeah
The question isn't, "Do he love ya?" The question is, "Do ya love yourself?"
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess way back then
We the best thing that never happened, but

[Chorus]
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

[Verse 2]
You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation? What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation, you need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look
Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo' hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needin' clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me

[Chorus]
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

[Outro]
I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth I gotta know
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
This one's for you, you, you, you, you, you, you



[Produced by Key Wane]

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
From the West but I'm heading to the Northside
That's the top, I need a crib on the shoreside
I need a backyard full court size
From where the judge is the only thing that's courtside
Chasing money in the city of crime
Cash back so then it's black bags under my eyes
Man fuck it I got a dream worth more than my sleep
To me playing in the game is worth more than the seats
Man fuck these hating ass bitches I'm gone
They told me no then I reverse it I'm on, I'm on!
I'm on, I'm on, they told me no then I reverse it I'm on
Mama had 2 jobs I know that she was working for me
Ten years later, Hired to working for me
Hired the whole family like mobsters
Getting paid off our operation we ain't even doctors
Grandma called, see me on the Billboards around the city
Man going around around the world so many times I'm dizzy
London or Japan, Orlando, Walt Disney
Paris, Abu-Dhabi, California weed twistin' yup!
Texas to Toronto where they love that nigga Drizzy
All the way to Detroit, the whole city fucking with me
Heading to the money, whole city coming with me
And I'mma rep the city 'til the reaper come and get me yup!

[Hook 1]
And this is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Good people, good drinks, good smoke
Got me thinking this is how life should go
This is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Family all around, all highs no lows
Got me thinking this is how life should go

[Verse 2: Wale]
Sitting back, putting all my issues in a swisher
I keep it funky with my Mrs, fuck these other bitches
And this ain’t biblical but this sermon is spiritual
‘Cause when it come to winning, convincing is only been a few
The upper percentile
Whipping whatever I, 460LS you
I probably go less miles, stay in a small circle
Know that it’s God working
Police got the swine flu and these niggas is reptiles
Yeah, Maybach poetic genius
You buying a seven jeans, keep mine in a seven Beemer
I’m trampolining on niggas and I actually mean it
A fly nigga, I keep having a gravity grievance
And while these niggas keep hating, they be asking for features
That’s like a complacent atheist is asking for Jesus
Riding around without a fuck given
Behind them dirty plates like a catcher with a mitten
The best in my position, I’m passionate with lyrics
And they ain’t fucking with the kid like Chris Hansen in the kitchen
I’m handsome to these women, I’m envied by these no ones
That’s no Joakim Noah, nigga everybody know us
And even if you don’t drink everybody po’ up
‘Cause all these hating niggas probably never gon’ show up
Never hate on no one, your blessing’s getting closer
Even when I’m open, it's nothing to Ed Cota wassup

[Hook 1]

Part II: "All I Know" ft. Wiz Khalifa

[Verse 3: Sean]
Could you tell me where to go? I need direction
Where are we now? Where's the intersection?
Motherfuck my phone, it never has reception
In this cold world, it's all about collection
So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto
Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world
I made a promise to the mirror
That I'd, never ever ever go broke
Riding through the city, I be riding through the city
All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though
Plenty smoke, plenty rolled

[Hook 2]
So I'mma drink and smoke and fuck and go go go
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
All I know, all I know -ow -ow
-ow -ow -ow [x8]

[Verse 4: Wiz]
Well, I’m flyin' over, literally, flyin' over cities
Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though
My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabana
I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know
I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now
No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints
Seen the how-to video now he on point
And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one
If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none
Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some
And there's only one, you know you know
Khalifa guy, I stay high like Pluto

[Verse 5: Sean]
Okay, I'm going hard (I'm going hard), I'm going dumb (I'm going dumb)
I'm going in (I'm going in), 'til I'm going numb ('til I'm going numb)
I got a lot to say, I don't hold my tongue
I just hold money, don't hold me up
Rolling in more green than a hole in one
You got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'
See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be
But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me
I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef
I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck
I don't dance, I two step, my weed loud, it suplex
I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex
Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG
Two fingers on my joint, one to the policeeeee

[Hook 2]



[Intro: Big Sean]
Uh-huh, is it time?

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look, I spent my whole life tryna improvise
I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize
Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with

[Refrain: Big Sean]
You know, take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, hood niggas takin' chains
Slave master take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

[Hook: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light
Hell nah the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Got the whole city on fire
Boy, this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired
This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire
This the flow that got my whole family finna retire
Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch
Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch
My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town
Where if they know you're brown, they might hold you down and even hose you down, man
Since I'm his son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon

[Refrain: Big Sean]
So when they take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, and hood niggas takin' chains
Slave master take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

[Hook: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
No, man they can't fuck with the light
Hell nah the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

[Outro: Jeremih]
Don't let them take away your soul
No, no (No, no)
Don't let them take away what makes you whole



[Intro - The Dream (Big Sean)]
Shit they got a picture of that shit?
Oh shit I'm finally famous
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down
How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now
(I Do It, Boi, Do It)
Multimillionaire (This life is Top Floor y'know)
(B.I.....G. Sean Don Nigga, Finally Famous in this, Gettin' Money)
(Carrion, G.O.O.D.) I wanna break you off like right now

[Verse 1 - Big Sean]
Hell yeah nigga high right now
That's the reason I said "hi" right now
Come have the time of your life right now
All you gotta do is close your eyes right now
This shit classic, they ask "where your outfit from?"
Plead the Saks Fifth, first class
Only culture games and practice
Oh you athletic? Shit, show me on the mattress
Cause it's already night time
And I feel like the right time
Twisting up my fingers
Like the young P-A-C, B-I-G but she just call me D-A-D
I do it

[Hook: The Dream] + (Big Sean)
Oh shit I'm finally famous
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down
How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now
(And I'mma need that penthouse on top of the world
That Detroit player on top of the world
Detroit players on top of your girl
It's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life..)
Fancy things...
Flashing lights, it's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life..

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Hell yeah, nigga gone right now
That's why we should get gone right now
I'm trying to get you home right now
I bet I could turn you on right now
Really I can't call it
Stress turned me into a weed-head
And parties into an alcoholic
And money turned me into a workaholic
And money turned her into a twerkaholic
Yeah do it, do it, do it with no hands
Do it like you do it when you do it with your man
I could pull up in a Honda Civic, pulling bitches
Ain't about the cars, bout that nigga who is in it
Right here: and all I need is a minute
Start it up, guaranteed I'mma finish
In the nighttime, I feel like the right time
So here go the drink you've been waiting all life for
Make sure the muthafucking ice cold
My jewelry is ice-cold, stone is albino
Cause you're burning up, your outfit is dyno
Let's give em a light show

[The Dream]
I ain't Paul McCartney or John Lennon
I ain't buying Beetles, I'm buying Benzes
They mad at you mamacita
Cause them bitches look like Bobby Bonilla

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Drake]
Low-key Peter Parker flow
Tell her bring some Ace of Spades no sparklers though
Private flights no hassle I just park and go
I’m the highlight like when markers glow
Oooooh, look what you created
Only got yourself to blame
I remember when you hated ooooh
Now you tell me take my time
How bout I just take your city make that muthaf-cker mine uh ha
I’m a underground king ho
I sit tall, I swang low
The game ain't always fair and thats the thing though
You can play your heart out everyone don’t get a ring though
You are in the presence of a champion
Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in
You always be calling her, she ain’t never answering
You ain’t figured out I am the reason that she canceling
I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can’t come in
Call me Ron Bergundy ya’ll the other anchormen
Whats on the news trick, gossiping bout music
Cause rumours I’m the new shit
And guess what it’s true bitch

[Hook: Drake]
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it

[Refrain: Drake, Big Sean]
I feel like we made it
But we ain't made enough
Its so amazing
You woulda thought we made it up
Man I was made to be greater
Made for the grind
Made for the lights
Made for the shine

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ay look
I need less friends more bread
Less talk more head
Used to ride escorts now I get escorted (do it)
I’m just waiting on my cue dog no pledge
Said she like all girls I turn that bitch co-ed
Threw on my track team handed my baton to her
Passed her blew her off, I chronic Veronica
Who got up on my nerves so I had to platonic her
No that ain't my girl but every leader needs a Monica
I’m the head of my estate ain't that ironic huh
I want the baddest chick to treat my stick like a thermometer
Ohh, I’m who they going ape shit over
I’m who your girlfriend acting like she ain't shit over
See broads over niggas but business over broads
See business equals money and money’s over all
I’m tryna move my momma from the ghettos to the meadows
Well she can’t stay in that fucking hood forever, forever
Was made for that Mick Jagger shit baggage check and a chick
Fast girls, faster whip, big chains master shit
Bitch I’m living everyday month yearly
Yell until you muthfuckers hear me
We made it

[Hook: Drake]
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it



[Intro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Yeah, you know a nigga
Don't really wanna take his cool off, uh
(Boi, do it!) I digress, it's

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, yeah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
She love the way I’m doing it (she do it)
So G.O.O.D. she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that?) My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there, let's capture this moment
If I hit it then I own it, marijuanin' every mornin
And patroning girl, we groaning
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid
With the street lights on, street lights on-on?
You know I gotta go in 'til it’s

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play (And I'mma give it to ya)
The long way (And give it to ya)
The strong way (We at it all day)
It’s our day (It's like this always)
It’s our way (After a long day)
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Talk to the, talk to the, hand
Bitch, you talking to a grown ass man
It’s like, way-way-way too much up in your pants
For us not to make the bed squeak
(There goes the bed sheets)
Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off? 'Cause I’m rapping my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it? The fucking anthem

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it

[Interlude: Kanye West]
I be saying, I, uh, I think
When I know, uh, just because..

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Big Sean]
I don’t really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you blazin’
And I swear you turn at least half Asian
And we about to have a liaison
She so cool, give head with her shades on
You should just go and throw a cape on
And it’s just so amazing
(So amazing, so amazing)
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop
That shit look like I’m speed racing
Leavin' with me, it’ll boost your reputation
Westside is where I’m stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it 'til it's

[Hook: Big Sean]
Yeah this was meant to be
I came in the world knowing nothing was for free
So you gon pay for her and she gon pay for me
My life is the shit I guess that this was meant for me
[Repeated]

Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a ho
I have been the realest since the doc cut my umbilical
Hundred inch dick yep and twenty pound genitals
So you gon have to stay there til my secretary tell you enter ho

Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a ho
Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a ho
Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a ho
I have been the realest since the doc cut my umbilical
Hundred inch dick yep and twenty pound genitals
So you gon have to stay there til my secretary tell you enter ho

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Stack that paper
Stack it stack it stack it up some more
Give me everything I want then I'm asking for some more

I'm smoking up on that tropical jolly green, yea Galapagos
Rainbow chain and my necklace look like a pot of gold
I'm who these girls is tryna know jumping off Jeronimo
They tell me I'm the best and I ain't even trying ho
See me I'm into hoes that's into hoes
So now I'm in two hoes, real shit boy
You don't drink? more for me
We chillin out where niggas can't afford to be
Look baby girl you better act accordingly
Cause I see bout ten more of you but sorry theres no more of meeeeee

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ca-ca-ca-catch me if you can
Cause I might go from plane to whips
Cause money is hand to hand
And I be shining neck to wrist
And your girl want mouth to mouth
And I make her get neck to dick
Cause she just want connections with a nigga that's connected
Bitch, I'm who they want see, want see
Used to tell me everything I won't be
You gon' be, fucking with piranha's and they gon' eat
But somehow I just turn the tide like laundry
Oooh, and now my life is beautiful
I'm a boss bitch you should come and grab a cubicle
Look and I remain until my funeral
Stand up nigga like I'm in front of the urinal

[Hook: Big Sean]



[Big Sean - Verse 1]
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I’m lit
So go head and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it then real life’d it!
I swear I’ve been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky’s the limit, how bitch? I’m moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it’s cool because I got the title ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Muthafuck the radio if I can’t hear mine
They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I’mma make it, but even if I don’t
Don’t feel bad cuz honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

[Hook]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

[Big Sean - Verse 2]
Are you willing to give up what you love for who you love
Or lose your girlfriend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set before you considered great?
How many missed calls before you considered fake?
How many dreams before its considered fate?
I’m eating in a world where I’m considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cuz they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can’t look at him in his eyes, you don’t know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say “in memory”
I’m praying that he make it, wished we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories…

[Hook]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

[Verse 3 — Big Sean]
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh
I’m stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, like who swallows the darts
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can’t purchase
Houses bigger than a palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I’m focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles
I’m marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle
Man, I’m huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner’s circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan’
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal $20 bill right out her purses
No I ain’t perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die, of course I have the memories..

[Hook]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo



[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live

They say sky’s the limit, how bitch?
I’m moonwalking

See I just want my fantasies in real life

Motherfuck the radio if I can’t hear mine

Don’t feel bad cause honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

[Refrain]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories

[John Legend]
Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug

Hit you on the couch and not the covers
And if you bring you friend then we got to fuck her
That's what I'm down for no convo, my condo
And if I answer this phone call don't make a sound ho
My life is my odyssey my dogs to the right of me
I got the girl you can't lay a finger on right here massaging me
Like Yeah....I'm the nigga I know it, I'm the nigga I know it
My Momma say I'm a poet, you hating praying I blow it
But this the life I made though

Feeling on her with my pimp hand

And bet she give me everything but attitude
Mathematical, radical
Twist my fingers up and rep my avenue
Penthouse altitude, being broke is not compatible
Get a fine girl, Patron that
Get a finer one, and then clone that
You cuff your wife like I want that
When I got freaky women tongue kissing
Marijuana lung lifting
Give long dick then I'm long distance
You in the club bromancing

Face in my lap nose dancing
No pants screaming

[Hook]

[Outro: Big Sean]
I believe in God and rubbers
Even if we sex you are not my lover
Hit you on the couch and not the covers

Burning all this paper you should try and catch the ashes

In the bank or a bitch droppin something off
Wo-wo-work ho make me throw this paper out looking like a paper route
Dick her down lay her out didn't have to take her out
Thinkin I'm a do her right look left and fake her out, haaa

[Hook:]
All I think about is money and sex fuckin and checks
In this life time you need to run and get left

And if I there I'm proly getting rich cause all I

Money and sex fuckin and checks

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I say I feel I feel I feel I feel I'm the best
Got the game on bubble like the vest, piece hangin on my
Chain chain hangin on my chest chest
The game is on lock money power and respect
I started in the streets choppin rocks in a gravel pit
Went from not having to having it
From dreaming to grabing it
With only top ramen noodles up in my cabinet
Now I'm killing this motherfucker, beating and stabbing it
Speaking of stabbing it where ya bitch she just text me
She say she in the room rockin something sexy
No disrespect g cause I ain't even trying to but send her to my room if you see her before I do

Always heard that lifes a beach so I'm forever getting laid
If money equals power then I'm a fucken generator
Man that spotlight bright
So watch me center stage it and do it
Yo girl wanna do it

But you already knew it
Can't remember the last time I seen my bed sets
Or the last time I had bed sex

I take a plan and then I back-to-back it
Hit after hit, check the batting average
I take the work, flip it, acrobatic
Got a little time and a lot of talent
Do a little talking and a lot of action
Seen the competition, hm, not a challenge
I lean, I move, I walk through in this bitch
Packed out, but I can count on my hands who I'ma talk to in this bitch
Girls from law school in this bitch
Yeah, they paralegals
Barely 21, that's very legal
But they doing shit that's probably barely legal, aw, man
It's that nigga that you probably least expected
I just had a couple dots that need connecting
Now your top five getting redirected
From here on out, it'll be consecutive
We making moves like Tarantino, like J.J. Abrams
Moving like Channing Tatum
Moving like Jason Statham
Motherfuck the whole industry
Half of these niggas my mini-me's
I got this bitch going off more than breaking and entering
You hot for a minute, me
I make the shit that last for infinity
Hop in the booth, man, that shit like a gym to me, don't test the agility
Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility
Okay, okay, okay, I'm on Rodeo for the day
If you owe me then you better pay your layaway, away
Stay away, or your ass might get K.O., kay today
Man, that "pew! pew!" hit your ass from like way, a-ways, away

Whodie holdie slowly back yo bitch ass up, you over close
I overflow all over hoes, my niggas is over hype
Shooting up your Phantom
Now they call your shit the Holy Ghost
Mercy, Lord would you please have mercy
And protect me from the hoes
That when life ain’t sweet, they gon' desert me
Shut the fuck up and stand up when you see me
Like I'm the verdict
That's respect, now I got your wifey
And you back to using that Jergens
Hurting, sipping, spilling
Tipping, for my niggas who done passed way
Charge your ass a "fuck you" fee
And make you pay your tax today
I'm on a secluded island, swear it feel like Cast Away
Put that money in my shooter hands, and tell him blast away
I feel like getting paper is my destiny
'Til I rest in peace, get money recipe
Told my mom "Get what you want
Then just leave the rest to me"
Ain't no motherfucking rest for me

Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Diamond rings, hundred chains, Slick Rick the ruler
I got cars, cribs all in my neck
Got them M's all in that bank
Griff, Blake all in that paint
Stacking bread, come watch me plank
Pray to never dying broke
Getting cases by the boat, we ain't shopping, buy the store
Shorty snorkel for that crab, eating lobster on my dinner plate
Stacking all this money homie, tryna see that ceiling break
Mula ain't everything homie, it's the only thing
Came from a hall of piss, straight to the hall of fame
Talk money, we got it, fuck boy, shoot your stylist
Eating good, I ain't brolic, I'm just chasing them commas
My niggas ride that five, and my bitch a ten
Got that China white, call it Jeremy Lin
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
My chain, a fridge, deep freezer, and a cooler

[Hook: Big Sean]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah

[Outro: Big Sean]
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me?
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride me?
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me?
Where my fine freaks, fine freaks, fine freaks?



[Intro: Big Sean]
After God, after my family, I ain't gon' front
Ain't nothing more important than this success, than getting it

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride me
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride me
(Finally famous nigga)

[Hook: Big Sean]

Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
I'm with my shooter and a preacher hallelujah
When they view ya fucking around
Me and my niggas we come in your town
Busting them bottles and fucking your bitches
And when they start hating we gunning them down
Don't fuck 'em around, boy I get money all day
And I ball hard like Tim Hardaway
I can see a bad bitch from far away
Let her ride this dick cause I had a hard day
And my dick even harder, you whippin' the charger
You put your rims on and you think that you're balling

And my shit so retarded I handicap parking like SKRRRRRR!

[Hook]

Fuck with me get a room for daisies on the dirt
I prefer brown liquor, brown ladies, brown Louis Vuitton
Condom on 'fo I go to work, that's my uniform
Nigga I used to eat mayonnaise sandwiches
By candle lit, and that’s cause the power’s out
And not for no romance and shit (No!)
From barely managing to mansions
Where ho’s call me Mr. Anderson
Command a bitch, no I don’t own the pussy I just sample it
I got a couple marbles missing I know
Now there’s marbles all on the floor
On the bathroom, kitchen and stove
I got bitches on my cellular callin' and confessing
But I don’t reply cause thats the clearest way to send a message
Paper running through my jugular
I’m blowing loud, throwing thous, getting drunk
You know my style
And my momma still say she proud, that’s mula

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I'm winning, I don't owe nann nigga shit
Came in this motherfucker by myself
Smoking on strong, and holding on my dick like AH
My gold on, I'm the bomb, I'm talking goldmine
Nigga's taking shots at me, I send em' back to their homeline
And I touchdown, goal line, y'all ain't killing shit
*Brrrraatttt* Shoot every nigga in your clique

Me and Nells on the milerun, uh, shawty gonna need her drawers done
Eat her pussy til' it's all gone, uh
And I still ain't ever been robbed, so nigga don't try me
Two niggas with guns, snatch yo' wallet
That's pickpocket, want my I.D
And I spaz on em'
Treat niggas like strippers and put cash on em'
Got a new chopper and that bitch still got a tag on it
If you shoot me, you famous, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
So I'm about to be, dumb as fuck, cause' God blesses fools in badges
When I was fifteen I was felon
When you were fifteen you were yelling
Mama come get this nigga off my fucking melon, DAMN IT!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Earlly Mac]
Scared money never gon' make nothin', (thats right)
Gotta get it my medula
Couple dollars in the waist band, (thats right)
Nigga hula-hoop with the mula
Everyday that I wake I say grace
Hallelujah welcome back like Mase
Bitches only fuck niggas with the cream
A nigga this fresh ain't never gon' date
Ay, they say we can't maintain
Only real niggas remain
'Ye say that we the new slaves
I need to ball with a chain
I got a real bad bitch I haven't seen her in a month
With some twins so big she can put em' in a bunk
Ooh I love it when she drop it and spread it like 
When I see the camel all I wanna do is hump
Okay the Hall of Fame keep callin' my name
Got a mural on the wall I'mma legend
Okay, I'm from the motor city and been have drive
I just need a little gas in my engine
Okay, we all in the game and we ballin' the same but

[Hook]
Shit, whose house is this?
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit
They told me a nigga wouldn't amount to shit
Nigga, whose house is this?
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit
But you don't know nothin' about that, shit

[Verse 1]
Yellin', whose house is this? Huh
Bitch, Do I even gotta ask now?
Who the fuck are you? Do you even got you a pass?
I don't know why you cuffin' yo girl, she ain't even got her no ass
Middle fingers to all of the nonbelievers
Not only did I beat the odds, I also got even
Took a spot up on the throne, I see myself see myself
Said it twice cause history repeats itself 'peats itself
Man I can't even lie, I be high I be high
Mother fuck drinkin' and drivin', I'd rather get high and fly
I'm out of here, like outer wear
We are not the same, you are not a player
My house is somewhere off in the woods, girls in my bed like I'm papa bear
They say hard work pays off, wrong it pays good as hell
You the man huh? Sorry I couldn't tell
Claimin' that they BIG, well I really can't lie
From the top they all look the same size

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I start my mornin' with the paper
Bitch I'm rich free press, hundreds on all the pages
And you can't slow me down, I'm sorry there's no delay
Me and my committee run the city, you just tryin' to join the relay
Leader of the new school, reportin' from the PA
These niggas call me cuz but I don't know why, cause we can't relate
I got yo sister doin' thangs on camera I can't replay
But she's a waste of time, fuck I could've had a V8
I turn thousands to milli's, it's time to renovate the ceiling
I'm turning houses to buildings, hustle while you out here chilling
What's the wordy I'm certainly getting rich in a hurry
I swear I fuck 'til I'm tired, I'm getting high 'til it's blurry
I'm from the dirty glove, where hammers turn crews into jurys
They'll make you sit down, but as long as you with me ain't no worries
Man I'm puttin' on for my crew, never for these hoes
I'm puttin' on for my city, she puttin' on her clothes

Hands up in the air
I just want the, I just want the baddest bitch in the world
Right here on my lap

[Hook: Chris Brown]
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last

Swear I'ma, swear I'ma do it like

Like I, like I never had it at a-a-a-all, a-a-a-all

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay, now where that alcohol? You ain't even got to ask
‘Cause I'ma drink it all like, like it's my last
She a 7 in the face but a 10 in the ass
She even look better by the end of my glass
See, I just walked in fresher
Than the Certs off in this muhfucka
I'ma need the baddest broad to twerk off in this muhfucka
I'ma go hard until it hurts off in this muhfucka
I'm a boss, so you gotta work off in this muhfucka
You don't have to work, and I can get you anythin' you want
I could, I could, I could, I could put you on
See, you look like Beyoncé, so do it like Beyon
Do it like Beyoncé, and put it on Sean
Grind hard, but I got a lot to show for it
Always had drive, like I had to chauffeur it
My team's so true we should get a camera crew
To follow us around and make a show for us

[Hook: Chris Brown]
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'ma, swear I'ma do it like

Like I, like I never had it at a-a-a-all, a-a-a-all
A-a-a-all, a-a-a-all
Like I, like I never had it at a-a-a-all, a-a-a-all

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Now I'ma fill this glass up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma blow this bag up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma spend this cash up like it's my last
And I'ma make it last, like it's my last
And I'm gone, can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan, now she all up in my space
All, all up in my face, like, "You remember who I am?"
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louis Vuitton Sean
Up in Benny Han Han eatin' all the Wonton
Rosé rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants, now she rockin' Sean john
Man, I just ended up on everybody guest list
I'm just doin' better than what everyone projected
I knew that I'd be here, so if you asked me how I feel
I'ma just tell you, it's everythin' that I expected, bitch

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Big Sean]
Hands up in the air
One time for the Westside, Westside, let me see them
Hands up in the air
D-Town! Two times if you love G.O.O.D. Music
Hands up in the air
And three times for the baddest chick in the world who got her
Hands up in the air (Yeah)

[Hook: Chris Brown]
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'ma, swear I'ma do it like
Like I never had it at a-a-a-all, a-a-a-all
Like I, like I never had it at a-a-a-all, a-a-a-all

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Big ass bottles, big ice buckets
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public
‘Cause if you don't do it big, bitch, you ain't doin' nothin'

[Hook: Chris Brown]
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this ass up, like it's my last
Swear I'ma, swear I'ma do it like
Like I never had it at a-a-a-all, a-a-a-all
Like I, like I never had it at a-a-a-all, a-a-a-all
A-a-a-all, a-a-a-all

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, "Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too."
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons (fuck 'em!)
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America, I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30, so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout, but they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power — how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit: I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the G.O.A.T. while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors

[Verse 2: Eminem]
If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, "late" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round, like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lam, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it
Trump's a bitch, I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A.
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beating 'em
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, "wait," pleading
But screaming is pointless like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma—

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Outro]
(I know you feeling yourself right now.)
(But I'm not sure she's the one — I wouldn't call her, man.)
"Hey, I'm outside."
What are you doing here?

Nothing is stopping you
Stopping you
Stopping you

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how
Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd
Parents always tried to keep me home
But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone 'til we on
What's up, Finally Famous
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers
At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this
I woke up early on a Saturday
Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today
Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: "Go rap for Ye
He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday"
Man, that shit sounds stupid
Then I hung up on his ass, then called him back like "Fuck, let's do it"
I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursued it
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it
Like, "Let's do it"

[Interlude: Kanye West and DJ Mo Beatz]
When I heard the songs he was doing
Man, I knew he had to be on G.O.O.D Music
(BIG! SEAN!) (x5)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches,
Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented
Cause I had a yellow bone that could've come from out the Simpsons
Man. who claim she never did it (Yeah right)
But under these conditions, she was with it
Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished
I been gone for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning
Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it
Getting rest that I be missing
But fuck it I'm on a mission
Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate
Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot
I know the Program Director hot
But I spit a freestyle up in there so cold
That everybody in that bitch forgot, now I'm running late for sound check
And I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station
And that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme
Manager said we ain't got time, but time to time
You gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around
I say "Aye dawg, What you got?", "Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot
Um, alright, it's that young renegade, man they been afraid
Tryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid
Um, I'm like a young black Eminem
It's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan
Tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them
And a bunch of synonyms about how he was living and I even let him finish it
I mean I can't lie he was alright, but at his age, shit so was I
So I give him my email on a fly
And if his song's good I'll reply

[Interlude: Trick Trick and Shorty]
Trick Trick: Hello
Shorty: Ay nigga, Ay trick, where you at nigga
Trick Trick: Ay what up, whats good, whats up man?
Shorty: Ay bro, ay nigga I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg
Trick: What!
Shorty: Bro, haha, I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg, aye
Trick: Oh hell naw, what?
Shorty: Hey I ran into this nigga, but aye he cool as hell man
Trick: Awwww Dang! Tight!
Shorty: Bet, He short as hell though
Both: Hahahaha
Shorty: But that nigga was cool though man
Trick: Alright!
Shorty: Man just like how he spit a hundred bars, I spit like two hundred bars

[Outro 1: Big Sean]
Tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith
In something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe
What you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch
What you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe
But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E
All the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need
All the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need
I'm sorry

[Outro 2: Mama Myra]
I know you're not my child talking like that. Focus on shifting this negative energy, into something positive. And the easiest way to do that, is to be grateful for all the things that you do have, for your health, for your family, your friends, all the people that care about you. You've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay. Ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi! haha



[Hook](x2)
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Tequila glasses, shots to the head cuz some memories they need assassins
Got a quarter pound of purp an eigth of gin and half my friends
Gone, Gone
Man fuck it though, not too good with fractions
Tried to do it all on my own, not too good with asking
Cuz when people give you a hand they want an audience back
But they not clapping and standing, they clapping at me let's panic
Pop pop that AK take candids
I aim for the sky, never landed
And yup
I look up up up in the mirror, I see a nigga gettin' rich off me
Hmm, and look at all these mother fuckers trynna get rich off me
But they wasn't there not when times got heavy man when things got deadly
Before my cash flow broke that levy man we ain't have no heat in that broke ass Chevy
Coming from a city where dreams get shredded, I'm goin off credit, these niggas need debit
Made mistakes but they made me what I am and I am what I am and I don't regret it
And I found the girl that I'd marry, the only curse
Is that I keep running into the girls that I'd fuck first

[Bridge]
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and want, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?

Fuck nah
Trynna make it out a city where niggas don't make it out
And if you do they want the blueprint so they can try and trace it out
They got that work, and thank God for yay
Signed to G.O.O.D, thank God for Ye
Before it's all said and done the one thing that I gotta say is

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Man I miss my grandma, she ain't passed away or nothin I'm just busy on camera
I love her, I love her, I should call her up and tell her
Give her some flowers, while she can still smell em
While she can still smell em, If you love somebody please tell em
I swear if you had 24 hours tell me who or what you'd do
Would you spend it all with your fam or would you get high with your crew?
Would you go back to your old girl and let her know that it's true?
Would you go back to your old boss and piss all over his shoes?
Would you, try and make the news? Would you get paid? Would you try to pay your dues?
Would you step it up or would you try and change shoes? Do you believe in karma or living for tomorrow?
Would you, hit the bar and go binging? Would you, steal a car, Mercedez Benz? and
Would you die alone, would you die independent? Or would have your friends right there in attendance
When it's all finished
Guess that depends on how you live
Just pray that all of your wrongs don't overshadow all that you did

[Bridge]
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and want, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?

[Intro: Big Sean]
They used to tell me, used to tell me

[Hook: Big Sean]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my step brother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, "Ain't too much that's different"
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

[Hook: Kanye West]
And I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, one man could change the world
One man could change the world

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My grandma told me, "If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white out"
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from, I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black, you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...

[Hook: John Legend]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

[Outro: Grandma & Big Sean]
Thank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about you
It's all good, I love you grandma
Bye



[Intro]
Yeah yeah

[Verse]
Okay now, why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that
You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that
You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pooled that
You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that
Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back
I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that
And I be in and out of love, the OGs be like true that
Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating
Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it
Dark skin with a lightskin girl like Taye Diggs
And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings
And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk
Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed
What if you lost your homie and you felt like Kriss Kross?
Double cross, I swear that Christians don't even get this crossed
Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off
She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft
Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball
I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw
Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off
Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off
Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk
It be like "we don't got time for bullshit, dawg"
You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype
You look like the "um, you owe me" type
Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no
Please don't Instagram this shit and be up on me like
"Oh, you owe me likes"
Man, I swear these bitches don't know what the fuck is more important to em
The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em
The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em
I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em
I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me
When we was riding four deep, boy, no AC
Headed to the game for okay seats
Now I'm courtside at OKC, I know KD
And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi
Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first
No late fees, Kool-Aid smile, Colgate teeth
The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks
I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy
Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know
But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um
White people with a black son
And first time I met Oprah, that was motivation
Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation
Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper
Plus my girl's rated R, all your hoes overrated, damn
Niggas say I changed, how they damn how they do
Say I'm hard to get in contact with, oh, is that true?
But what about now? 313
515-8772, bitch, call me



[Hook]
All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right, though
'Cause you so fucking outta line
For ever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

[Verse 1]
Feel like you owe me checks
Owe me time, owe me sex
Long nights, no reply
I got no regrets, you disrespect, disrespect
Only time I seen you now is on the internet
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to
You got my tattoo, we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals
Now you back,  it's our revival
They don't make you feel like I do
They didn't make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku
Seems like all you got is hate for me
All you ever did was take from me
'Cause you know you got that walk from me
How you dress and how you talk from me
Let's not ever disrespect what I meant to ya
It took us being over to see all I did for ya
Damn

[Hook]
All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gonna take more than that to set it right, though
'Cause you so fucking outta line
For ever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

[Verse 2]
I'm just trying to let the past pass
Ain't no future in that, yeah
I stay 100 like my dash, yeah
Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah
Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask
Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass
Honestly I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play no blame game
Pointing fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust
I don't wanna have a fake us

[Hook]
But all that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right, though
'Cause you so fucking outta line
For ever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

[Outro]
My friends say I should be over you
Getting hurt every time I'm close to you
I think me and you are overdue
I think this is what we supposed to do
'Cause you so fucking outta line
For ever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

[Skit: Paparazzi]
Nigga, you know what's about to go down when you walk out that door
Man, I hope these niggas not out here man, fuck
Big Sean, boy, swerve
I don't...with you
Ok, we see you
New girl, new car
Lamborghini Mercy, ok we feel it
Aye is this the- is this like the real thing this time with this one?
Or is this another one of those flings?
Like, you gonna bring her home to mom
Does mom know about this one?We know you're close with your mom
What you say about animal cruelty?
Like do you think they should have shot Harambe or like what?
I mean do you think he was going to maul the kid?
We seen you in the furs man, don't lie



[Intro]
Yeah
(Ear Drummers)
Uh huh
(Mike WiLL Made It, Mike WiLL)

[Hook]
I always wanted to stunt so hard
I always wanted to ride that whip
I always wanted to fuck that bitch
Thank you God, I fucked that bitch
I always wanted to live this life
I always wanted to wear that ice
I always wanted paradise
I always wanted paradise

[Bridge 1]
Look, now it don't take a lot to make you rich (make you rich)
I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit (crazy shit)
Man, I feel like money is the best drug (best drug)
Sometimes hate can be the best love

[Verse 1]
Walkin' in like I got cameras on me
Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
Bitch, you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homies
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short change
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

[Bridge 2]
Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag

[Interlude]
Straight up, finally famous nigga
Aw damn, damn

[Verse 2]
Aw damn, I'm illuminated, man, I knew I make it
And I get that shit accumulated
Never throwing money out, I boomerang it
Finally famous over everything, that's a numerator
Weed lit, yeah, it's illuminated, room lookin' like it's fumigated
Bitch, my crew invaded, when I walk in, man, they body to body
Hol' up everybody, don't worry, man, I got it, I got it
I need a hundred dollar bill, photocopy the email and copy
Man, I'm going hard all season
These hoes goin' both ways, offense, defense
Livin' life on the deep end, F-F allegiance
Beat the odds and got even
What you think, that we just started, nigga?
Boy, the sword just got sharper, nigga
This ain't war, we just sparring, nigga
I was on the rooftop with my nigga Mike Carson, nigga
Shootin' that "Too Fake" video, my nigga, we all in
We set ourselves apart from all our apartments
Was up in Florida, no Marlins, nigga
I'm that Shawn, no Marlon, nigga
Look at my girl nigga, fuck yo' bae list
Fuck yo' night list, fuck yo' day list, fuck yo' playlist
I'm from the D, fuck your A-list
I been working 8 days a week
I don't even know what the fuck today is
I hit the booth and I just went super saiyan
I run with the purp like I play with the Ravens
These bitches rant and rave
I hope I never have to go back watching
Everybody Loves Raymond
Eating ramen, nigga, this paradise
Life's a fucking paradox and pair of dice
If they not rolling with you, then they parasites nigga
I had that vision, it was ClearSight, nigga, Sean Don

[Verse 1]
Come roll with a nigga, get high with a nigga
Count stacks with a nigga, fuck hoes with a nigga
Back in high school we used to trade clothes with my niggas
Back when Iceberg and Girbaud
Was like the wardrobe for the killers, we pose for the pictures
Stunting on hoes, I stunt with my bros
Real go-getters, I swear being broke didn't fit us
Like new T-shirts, new jeans, new hats
You know, spending gas money on everything except gas
Spending my last on the shit that won't last
Back when 20 dollars would impress that ass
A movie and popcorn and caress that ass
Overdress to undress that ass, god bless that ass
It was me and my dawgs, summer on summer
Riding around like we dumber on dumber
Whipping that Toyota like it's a Hummer
What happened to those days? I really do wonder
When all I did was safe sex, latex
The first time I slipped up, wished I had a homemade AIDS test fuck
But I ain't flunk once
Back before I got drunk once
I was smoking on haze, all in a daze
My homies would call and say, "nigga, come roll"

[Break 1]
The D grown us to get it man. You know what I’m mean? Just hustle, hustle, hustle. They, you know we, you know, there really wasn’t that much opportunity for us, man. So, we just had to let our nuts hang and just, shit, boss up and, and learn the game

[Verse 2]
Man, I'm straight up off the 7 Mile, they call that the better mile
Tryna get a house up in the woods off on 11 Mile, bet it now
One time for the D, Girls that hold me down Corretta style
Free Juan, let him out
And everything I want off in the world is a must-have
I realised that at the bus stop with a bus pass thinking "fuck rap"
Cause there's niggas in the streets
Getting money under my nose that I must stash
I've seen people get murked who ain't deserved that shit
Cops should've protect-and-served and shit
But still pull me over, disrespect and search my shit
Ask "why the attitude?" cause bitch, you deserve that shit
Bang bang bang, how do you maintain
A sane brain and mind in a city of AKs and K9s?
When only language they know English and gang signs
Fuck it all though, I'm repping till the world blow, come roll

[Break 2]
Well shit, I’m just, you know, I’m proud of lil' bro man. That nigga listened and he was able to stay focused man and through all the adversity man and through all the hood politics. But he seen it, he was with it, he was on it, you know? I mean like I say the Linwood man, shit that’s what we know the city man, that’s for the city man all fucking day

Okay, I won't deny it
Half the time you send a text, yep, you know I'm not replying
Just to let you know, I'm not one of them niggas you be dodging
I'm the one that you dodge with
I'm the one that you gon' take that dress you saving out the closet

That you gotta put on speakerphone
Just so you can let them know what we be on, like he the one
Yeah yeah, I know I'm young but you respect me like a father figure
Young mobbish nigga, probably make you father figures
Sean Don Perrier out in Paris with a pair of Yays going
Well, I would tell you but I gotta paraphrase
And even when you tripping, we tripping, I pay for ya
Gourmet for ya, chauffeur arranged for ya
I'll take that flight alone earlier in the day for ya
Just to beat you there and prepare, let you know I'm waiting for ya
Finally Famous

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't like them other niggas
And I ain't 'bout to play no games with you
You know what your problem is?
You don't ever see the big picture
Oh wee, I want you to take me serious
Oh baby, I want you to take me serious

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Wait, wait, waiting for ya
I be wait, wait, waiting for ya
You've got a young boss nigga like me waiting for ya
You got that bomb ass, pussy, I've been waiting for ya
Who ya love? Tell me who you fucking love
Tell me who you wanna fuck and love
I left that sexy dress out on the bed with a note there laying for ya
With directions where I'm waiting with dinner and waiter for ya
I'm that nigga, she tell me I'm that nigga
I'm the nigga that's your nigga even when you got a nigga
That you make love with, but right before take drugs with
Then right after, hit the tub, wait on me with suds
Then you back that ass up on me like it's 99
Wine fine, like a bottle from the 99
Hit you with the 99 like it's fucking primetime
Killed the pussy, had to hit that shit like nine times
Girl, even when I'm gone, just know I'm there for ya
I'm all ears, in other words here for ya
I'd probably rob a fucking bank and go to jail for ya
As long as I can smack that ass and pull that hair for ya
Finally Famous

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't like them other niggas
And I ain't 'bout to play no games with you
You know what your problem is?
You don't ever see the big picture
Oh wee, I want you to take me serious
Oh baby, I want you to take me serious

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been waiting on that ass all night though
Girl, don't keep me waiting no more
Yeah, yeah, it's true
Got some things I wanna do to you, baby, oh
Ooh yeah!

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't like them other niggas
And I ain't 'bout to play no games with you
You know what your problem is?
You don't ever see the big picture
Oh wee, I want you to take me serious
Oh baby, I want you to take me serious

This my roll weed time
Don't turn it into dead in the street time
Her legs do the peace sign
Know the hood so well don't need street signs
Young rich and iconic
Big titties I'm signin'

Big white smoke clouds every time I talk, does it look like I'm in a comic?
Everything I rock I designed it, realer nigga, won't find it
Okay, I be stackin' that cheddar, bet that shit won't expire
Got me ballin' so hard, I need me Jerry Maguire

Got your girl and your girl and they hoein' it out
But you standin' outside cause no hoes is allowed
If you work like I work, you would throw in the towel
Once you get in this life, man, there's no comin' out
And haters look at me like snow in the south
Surprise nigga
Man fuck it, I'm on, you off and I hope you die nigga
Why you alive nigga?
I'm stackin' dough cause my momma addicted to spas
Yeah I'm the one that these hatin' niggas despise
You better take off your fuckin' disguise, nigga
Bitch-made is in your eyes nigga
Lies nigga
Shut the fuck up, everything'll be fine
Cause this my roll weed time



[Intro: Big Sean & Future]

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Fuck what you telling me, I sense the jealousy
I got telepathy, I got the recipe
I got the streets and I don’t got no felonies
Forward thinking, yeah my mind is ahead of me
Momma said it's gonna be whatever you let it be
It's some homies I grew up with that's dead to me
It's some niggas that I just met in debt to me
What's in common is they both pay respect to me
I get it my way from Friday to Friday
My girl is a mix of Aaliyah and Sade
I came a long way from that "Marvin and Chardonnay"
I pull out the driveway like I’m in a car chase speeding!
And if my bitch cheat she know I’m leaving!
No text, no call boy
That bitch airplane mode, cold
No peacoat, no time to change clothes
Same clothes, love if you living by the same code
G-code, leave ho
Fuck it you dead to me, back to my destiny
Penthouse, birds eye view, that's a nest for me
I got my self out of debt
So when you see me, know you're somebody I'll never need

[Hook: Big Sean]
I done made sacrifices (I, I)
So many sacrifices (straight, straight up)

And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (straight up)
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices
Fuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Big Sean]
I cut the fuck shit drama out my energy
Focused on the inner me, never on the enemy
And I done sacrificed my own time, I done sacrificed my own mind
I done sacrificed the club life, I done sacrificed my love life
Look, I cut the fuck shit drama out my energy
Focused on the inner me, never on the enemy
And I done sacrificed my own time, I done sacrificed my own mind
I done sacrificed the club life, I done sacrificed my love life

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
I done sacrificed the thug life, diamonds shining ain't no dull life
Drop my top to get my mind right, pull up in the 'Rari, loud pipes
Bitch I'm the don, my wrist a hundon (Patek)
Ooh, yeah, Gucci python
Ooh, yeah, she play with her tongue
Yeah, I bought that bitch a new charm
Lit nigga pop one
I told her come see about me (come on, come see me)
The devil had entered my soul
My momma had beat it out me (the devil, my momma)
Remember my grandmama had told me you better be somebody
Hop in my seats massaging (aye)
Watch how I lead the posse, I made an M deposit

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Paid all these dues with the game (yeah yeah)
Sacrificed yo stripes for that stain (sacrifice)
Heard you sacrificed your life for that chain (yeah yeah)
She sacrificed that money for cocaine (white, phew, coco)
Left hand got three rings, that's Bron Bron, we up one
Bad bitch she a savage, take her to the mall and buy her something
That's gonna wanna make your friends come
Make way with the tommy gun
Why can't y'all recognize
That we all came from sacrifice?
Why can't y'all recognize
That we all came from sacrifice?
Ten toes, yeah, you gotta stay down, ayy
Just some young niggas looking for a way out, ayy
People watchin', yeah, I gotta skip town, ayy
Hit my phone if you need a whole pound, ayy

[Hook: Big Sean]
I done made sacrifices (I, I)
So many sacrifices (straight, straight up)
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain’t free
Fuck it, I sacrificed it
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (straight up)
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices
Fuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Big Sean & Quavo]
I know my great, great, great aunty was a slave
I could only imagine all the sacrifice she made
I could only imagine all the shit she had to take
I'mma make sure all the blood she gave wasn't in vain
I sacrificed for your entertainment boy
I'm Mr. Anderson in the Matrix
Check the last name it's all facts
And the human race is all about pacing
Look at all the ones I outlasted
I'm the one at the end like I count backwards
Never satisfied, details classified
'Til the afterlife, make a sacrifice, Don
Why can’t y’all recognize
That we all came from sacrifice?
Why can’t y’all recognize
That we all came from sacrifice?



[Intro: TWENTY88]
Every time you call
You know I'm gonna come get ya
You know I'ma come get you
Every time I'ma come with ya
Every time you call
You know I'ma come get ya
You know I'ma come get you
Every time I'ma come with ya

[Chorus: TWENTY88]
At the same time
Put you on a ride of your life
And meet you there at the same time
Same place, same time
Every time you call
At the same time, same place, same mind
At the same time, same place, same mind

[Verse: Big Sean]
Who overdue for a night off?
Left the crib, I get you right off
How soon is too soon?
I see you every full moon, blue moon
We never did the relationship, it gets too messy
But if we keep messing with the wrong people
At the right place, at the right time, we might let it
You remember when you came to Sweden
I came too and we treated the hotel room
Like the Garden of Eden
Chill, I won't tell all your secrets

[Bridge: TWENTY88]
Look, we in tune, we in sync
Eye to eye, don't need to blink
We been here, don't need a drink
I bring my A-game
And put you right where you need to be
Look I fuck you, touch you, tease you
Have you learning things about you
No one could teach you
I see in you seein' me
Tell me what you see in me

[Outro: Jhené Aiko]
Every time you call...



[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Welcome to Hell's paradise
I always heard life was a pair of dice
Seven, eleven, or a pair of eyes
As I’m looking at her smearing eyes
She yelling “Take them glasses off, yo eyes are the only things that’s not lying”
Not caring to the point that I stopped lying
I tell her I feel the same
She tell me “Nigga quit playing, you the only one that’s not crying”
You said you wasn’t on no steal your man shit
If I broke it off now we won’t be on some friend shit
Man, what goes around comes around, that ceiling fan shit
I broke the levy to your eyes that I don’t give a damn shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And time after time, it’s the same old shit
Think it might be too late, for me to learn from my mistakes
And I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you
But you should have used your head first
This might be the biggest mistake, it’s too late
Cause two can’t be in first place](1045497)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Well, wake up then, shit, call your ex and make up then
What was no strings attached got tangled when
Fun stopped being fun, and feelings tried to finagle in
We had that independent love, you tried to bring a label in
Girlfriend? Nah, I already got one
You need a good guy and I'm already not one
She said we lost a kid already, I'm already not that young
My biological clock is ticking, I'm not just tryna have fun
Shit's way different from us first chilling
Sometimes last words can have the worst ending
Wish we could fast forward time and reverse feelings
Is there a warranty for love to return or fix it? (Hmm)
She said you good either way
When it was her last night nigga and me today
You the man, huh? Getting all the TNA
You fucking her raw too, sharing our DNA?
Huh, and so on and so on
And the shit just always goes on
Nothing about us feeling right
But she'll be back before the end of the night

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And time after time, it’s the same old shit
Think it might be too late, for me to learn from my mistakes
And I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you
But you should have used your head first
This might be the biggest mistake, it’s too late
Cause two can’t be in first place

[Outro: Chris Brown]
I love, I love her



[Intro: Nas]
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs

[Chorus: Big Sean & James Fauntleroy]
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
Top floor, only way that we go
Diamonds and gold, Sierra Leone, Leone
Hotel look like Sierra Leone, Leone
Chain, ring look like Sierra Leone, Leone
And she don't ever tell me I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Cause she don't want to leave Sierra Leone, Leone

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Get to it, I be getting to it
Hella groovin', rooftop, better viewin'
Always hella coppin', no propellers, moving bank tellers
Movin', youngin', revenuin', mozzarella chewin', you know?
Lobster butter basted
I deserve every crumb tasted, road to riches one way and
Sunbathing, tongue tastin'
After that she wine tasting, Sean tastin'
You know? I gave her diamonds and gold
That's Sierra Leone, her friends like "Girl don't let go!"
So she ain't askin', she ain't whinin'
Complainin' or trippin', man I got her damn near strippin'
For the handbag livin', Saks Fifth'n, tag rippin'
No more tab splittin', cab gettin', who wants to go back to that livin'? Do yah?
So let's sex on the beach
Then the rest on the sheets for the rest of the week, 'til

[Chorus: Big Sean & James Fauntleroy]
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
Top floor, only way that we go
Diamonds and gold, Sierra Leone, Leone
Hotel look like Sierra Leone, Leone
Chain, ring look like Sierra Leone, Leone
And she don't ever tell me I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Cause she don't want to leave Sierra Leone, Leone

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
What you know about wake up to fuckin' 'fore you even can stretch?
Yeah I'm on vacay and my dick still need a rest
I might get her on film, star and direct
Just might win an award if that shit hit the net
Oh, reclinin' in seats
Not liftin' a finger 'less I'm signin' receipts
Livin' life like I got a degree
Fuck it, I'm livin' life like I done got in the league
Look, my car look like it play for the Lakers
Credit card look like it play for the Raiders
I watch it play for the paper
Chandelier, marble floor on the feet
She said I'm a don, I gotta agree, I fuck her to sleep

[Chorus: Big Sean & James Fauntleroy]
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
Top floor, only way that we go
Diamonds and gold, Sierra Leone, Leone
Hotel look like Sierra Leone, Leone
Chain, ring look like Sierra Leone, Leone
And she don't ever tell me I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Cause she don't want to leave Sierra Leone, Leone

[Greedy Ho's Skit]
Big Sean: I gotta take a shower, you so goddamn nasty, baby
*someone knocks at the door*
Big Sean: Hey, who is it?
His girl: Oh shit, it's just room service
Big Sean: Room service? Again?
His girl (to her friend): What about these rings? What are you looking for?
Big Sean: Hey can you grab me a towel?
Her friend: What about that phone?
*Big Sean singing*
His girl: Come on, lets get outta here
Big Sean: Yo! Yo! Hello? Bitch! What the fuck?



[Hook]
I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

[Intro]
I do It
For the city, man

[Verse 1]
Feeling like I got the cheat code to life
Jewelry looking like it got free-throwed in ice
Debating with the Reaper not to repo my life
Cause in my 23 years I've lived a couple lives
Like why? Cause I stunt? Bag the tree like it's fall?
The girls that was out of my league trying to play with my balls
I pay bills, I work hard, and when my mama cried a river
They never gave us a bridge, they gave us a bridge card
Nigga riding low, puffing on loud
I came way too far to fuck it up now
Text from my mom said "Me and your grandma proud"
I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
Teacher told me to get a job, save up for 401(K)
Man, I'd rather be young as shit counting 401k
I'd rather die with a smile instead
I'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
But I'm never dividing the bread
Bitch, I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred I deserve
Throwing West side up like Pac up
Where they pop your block up, b-blocka big poppa flock off
You holy lil whoaty holy kenobi chewbacca
I'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I bet you that you won't find it
Rockin' Louis and MCM, I guess I'm clothes-minded
I'm in the Obama suite, you one below in the Joe Biden
I'm in your city just chilling where all your hoes hiding?
20k for the fit because it's 24 carats
I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it
I'm just D-town repping
Making all these niggas who second-guessed regret it
Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets
I realize now how much I love Ashley Marie
And when it's all said and done, I'll probably get on my knee
Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring
Man, she almost cried when she see me on TV on BET
Just making it seem easy! Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day's a Friday and every night's a sex scene
Every week is Fashion Week and every day I'm pressed clean
Detroit's angel, I even got red wings
Headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
It's prom night, and guess who's the prom king?
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King
Everybody know I'm coming soon like Lebron's ring
Tell me that wasn't the verse of the year
Man, that shit deserves a hearse and a tear
Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overfucked
All my deals be overpaid and all my joints be overstuffed
Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a fucking thing that's over us
So take that check out and owe it up! Man, I turn impossible possible
And what these niggas could barely see into optimal
The same teacher who told me rap is what not to do
Said I'm throwing my life away, if I drop out of school
Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove
Is that I did everything they told me not to do
After I went down the road they told me not to cruise
They ain't know that was my road to success
Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through
My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional
My old school look like a T-Rex: I should feed her fossil fuels
Man, I turn my enemies to molecules, lil hoes
Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations
Man they wanna see me dead, but I gave 'em dedication
And I'm yelling fuck 'em all with a hundred exclamations
Cause I'mma be the man til my fucking expiration

[Hook]

[Outro]
BIG, I do it, this goes out to my muthafucking city of Detroit
Westside to be exact, right over there on Northlawn



[Intro]
Yeah

Uh huh, where the money?

Weed, money, liquor

[Verse 1]
Okay, I ain't that fucked up, but I'm halfway
We came a long way from the alley
Bad, bad, bad bitches they dressed up
Like it's the NBA draft day
And I bet and I bet that she ain't gon' be that late
For a young, sexy face like me
A young, young, young, sexy face like me
She like girls if she don't like me
And if you do then I do girl, I see ya, I see ya
The way that you pose I might have to IG ya
Sexy young thing, I might have to ID her
Ooh, damn I got some ideas
We could fuck up the couch in the club like it came from Ikea
Goin' so hard the whole night is a blur
Older women be like, "damn, you mature"
I say you the one, but goddamn I got nerve

[Hook]
My whole squad in this bitch
And they gon' stay there the whole night
I mix that shit with champagne
Been waitin' on that shit my whole life
Forever me and my dawgs
Yeah, nigga, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know

[Refrain: Big Sean + Kanye West]
And they always stay down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
This for my dawgs, for my dawgs, man, that always stay
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Weed, money, liquor
I'mma drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown

[Verse 2]
Okay, I sip the kamikaze while I bend the body
And I whip the Maserati like I'm Ricky Bobby
I be mobbin', I be mobbin' like I'm Gotti
I might even speak Italian
50 women in the room like we ain't even got a lobby
I be wildin' like I never had a daddy
And the titties paparazzi, they be flashin', god damnit I'm a hottie
Got her friends tryna fuck me and her man's tryna rob me
And she won't leave me alone, I tell the trick to get a hobby
I ain't even gonna lie, I got a million dollar chick
With a billion dollar pussy
Every time I cum, I swear to God I feel like I be rich
Yeah, tryna get that hotel money
But you know them crackers ain't gonna let you get the Ritz
They ain't gonna let you get the fountain in the front with the fist
They gonna give you courtside at the Clips
But never ownership, they ain’t on that donor shit
Well, fuck giving it to me, I'mma take that shit
Forget crackin' the code, I'mma break that shit
I'mma calamari steak that shit
And cop so much ice, me and my dogs gonna skate that shit
Bitch do it so big you can't escape that shit
Hoes tryna have my baby just to Ricki Lake that shit
I hate that shit
Girls handing me their heart, how could I not break that shit?

[Hook]
My whole squad in this bitch
And they gon' stay there the whole night
I mix that shit with champagne
Been waitin' on that shit my whole life
Forever me and my dawgs
Yeah, nigga, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know right

[Refrain: Big Sean + Kanye West]
And they always stay down, down, down, down

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Weed, money, liquor
I'mma drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown



Yea, what up! It's Common right here! Y'all know where I come from, and uh, shoot I used to come to the D. I used to go to Detroit, like, every two weeks to record with J Dilla. I be standing at the Atheneum, and then, you know, he'd come scoop me up; he had a Range. We'd either eat, we'd eat at a Coney Island, close to his crib. He stayed 'round McNich'. We'd go down in his basement and stuff, and Jay Dee would dig through the records and then he would make a beat. And then once he make a beat, I'd be like, "Yo that beat cold," and then I'd just sit there. And Frank, Frank would be around. And then you know, and we'd just be kicking it; I'd be getting some Heinekens and stuff, and then uh, they'd go to Chocolate City, to the strip club. And I wasn't all into the strip clubs at the time, so I'm like yo, I'd just be like, I'd sit there and be like, "I'm about to write this rap." Then one time I was like, "I'm going to the strip club with y'all." I went to the club, and man they had some good chicken wings, man some good, thick girls, and it was right. Anyway, I love the D, man; We used to kick it off in the D. That was like all day. That's what we do



Yea. It's so cold in the muthafucking D. I'm talking 'bout real cold mane. I'm talking 'bout June 19-mothafuckin'-86, on the West Side off 8 Mile Road, living with my pops while he was working at a mufuckin' post office. Right around the corner, I was working at McDonalds, getting up in the morning doing that breakfast shift. I was so cold on the mothafuckin' eggs, they called me Young Eggs, mane. I mean I had it locked and loaded. I was gon' fuck around and go to school out there too. The coaches wanted me to come to Cooley High and play basketball and do my thang. But you know what man, the experience I had in Detroit was a hell of an experience because it shaped me, it molded me, it grew on me. I came back from Detroit, I was new and improved. I remember I wrote me a song. I said uh, "I went to Detroit to make my move. I'm on track, now I'm back, and I'm new and improved." That's how I came back from Detroit, you understand me. I was new and improved. So all my folks out there in the D, it's so mothafuckin' cold from the West Side to the East Side. Y'all know what it is. I used to stay on Whitehill Street on the East Side too, right by the Eastland Mall, ya dig. So I mean I'm well rooted and tooted and suited and booted. Part of the D is part of the G and the LBC. This is Big Snoop Dogg. Big Sean, you know what it is. Detroit! Let's go



[Young Jeezy Speaking]
Yea, you know what this is, nigga. You know who this is. That's right, Young, nigga. I'm like one of Detroit's own, you know. I fuck with the D so much cause, you know, it's a natural place of born hustlas. You know, real niggas, money go gettas, against all odds, you know. I remember the first time I came to the D for a show, you know what I'm sayin'. Um, I hit the homies up, let 'em know I was in town. I was sitting at the Atheneum, and mufuckin' um, the show was over at the Zoo Bar, and nigga we walked - literally - 300 deep to the club, all black tees. Matter of fact, we walked back from that mufucka, you know what I'm sayin'. I went and did my show, repped out, you know what I'm sayin', walked back to the hotel, hung out...for a minute and niggas was like, "Yo, let's hit the Sting," and I'm like, "What the fuck is that?" "It's like a strip club in the hood. That shit stay open every night." I'm like, "Shit, that's right up my mufuckin' alley," you know. But you know most of all, you know about the D, I got mufuckin' niggas in the D that I really love and fuck with genuinely, nigga, as they fuck with me befo'. You know, it was really rap shit. You know when I was trappin' mixtapes, niggas in the D was fuckin' with me like I was from 7 Mile or some shit, you know what I'm sayin'. West Side, Southwest, for real. I was tellin' a nigga Sean, I'm like, I said, "Nigga, it ain't a lot of superstars in the D." I was like, "Nigga, they got you and Eminem, but other than that, nigga you know, they got street legends, nigga. You know, niggas who really done that shit. Got it in, ya feel me?" What up, doe!



[Hook: Big Sean]
Thanking God for all my set backs
'Cause he the reason I'm able to get back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack, yeah

[Verse: Big Sean]
This the feeling know that I've been missing some days
This feel like I'm headed to paradise one way
This feel like the family dinners that we used to have on Sunday
With Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake
Or this spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man
This feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam
Pink Timb's, in the Lamb
Mixing it in with Dilla and
Headphones to the ceiling fan
Bucket hat like Gilligan, yeah
Lately I've been talking to ghosts
Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most
You know I still rep you when you're gone though
I got a picture of us on the front lawn
With me, grandma and mom, that night I went off to prom
Wishin' you could see the lights all dijon and parmesan
Funny thing about it is you always act like you knew
You told me how you were feeling before it happened, before it do
And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through
And you and grandma went broke so we would never get bruised
You the reason that I ever touched my first Franklin
Fast forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin
It reminded me of how we always used to dress up as a family
And go to Sunday service, and being in church singin'
Ain't been to church in awhile
But it ain't just about how you just praise him in the building
It's about how you praisin' him while you out
You taught me to remember that when I get set back
Been through the worst times to get the best back
Wishin' for a time machine to jet back
To my all time low self and throw me a jetpack, woah
And see you again, needless to say
Back when I dated Alisha, Simone
Or any other girl who looked like Lisa Bonet
Who was jealous of me and Jhené
Who you would always advise with me being away
You was right, but I had to learn for myself
I guess a time came for me to earn for myself
I hope that this is somewhat of a thank you for all your help
Hope the angels take care of you until I see you myself

[Bridge: The-Dream]
Praise, so many times I prayed for you
I put up prayers for you
Praise, for all the times that you prayed for me
All the nights you stayed by me
All the nights that you cried and all the days I coulda died
Because of you I survived, because of you I'm still alive

[Hook: Big Sean]
Thank you God for all my set backs
'Cause he the reason I'm able to get back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack, yeah

[Outro]
Elder Sean: You gonna let it ring forever? Answer that!
Man: Yo, she keep calling. Yo, and your dad left you a voicemail, and your girl keep calling
Sean: Ah fuck.. I got to call her back. Aye, yo pass it to me real quick. Hello? Hey ma



[Intro]
I do it
Do it, do it
B-I G, Finally Famous getting money
G.O.O.D. music, look
What up Earl Mac
My nigga Tone say he so Westside
It's a damn shame
Me too, D-Town, D-Town

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
D-Town, Westside
Yeah I said it, Westside
But they yelling big so much
That you would thought it's Bed-Stuy
You are now fucking with the newest nigga best out
Go on, roll that weed nigga, cause I'm stressed out
L-V checked out
Bad bitch, chest out
No wonder why Mrs. Right just keeps on getting left out
Oh well that's everything I'm not concerning, fuck it
I'm on the top floor getting brains, higher learning
Getting higher earnings and my desires yearning
Running through that paper like my attorney
Hundred blunts rolled, you can smell the fire burning
I'm in the fast lane, you can smell my tires burning
Exercise, flex on guys
Model chick
Sex on thighs
Bump a lot
A Lexus drive
I might let Alexis drive
Jesus chain, testify
I over accessorize
Test her out, now she gon' need a stretcher when I stretch her out
When it's time to speak, bet all of ya'll listen
When you up in the party
Why is all the broads missing
And I just drop lines like a nigga gone fishing
Man and I be on them posters like that nigga gone missin'
And I spit that er-retarded shit just call it autism
I'm so Hollywood that I might make your bitch audition
Before we cut
Cut, cut
Movie time, cut
I'ma dick her down, you gon' pick her up
And I'm unusual as shit
I'm Superbad, your girl probably doodling my dick
And it's a couple screws up in my head that could use a fucking wrench
And I'm just looking at the game like
Damn, they could use a fucking bench, bitch
And my name all up in the rafters
She gon' make me cum, I bet that money come faster
Kanye first, then I'm coming after
And Lou' Vuitton shoes ho
Dons and the Jaspers
Who her, I ran through her walls
Made her scream and disappear but hell no my name is not Casper
Boy, what the fuck these rappers sound like
Just a whole bunch of my sound bites
First whip, garbo
Second whip, Largo
Don’t worry bout my niggas Thurgood Marshall
Bank account got me feeling Well, Fargo
Balling til I get a Milicic Darko
I did that
I just give them line after line, after line
After line, after line barcode
They looking for my work, Narco
Cause I just black out in the booth, charcoal
Me, Don C, Tone and fifty-four bitches
Since we finna blow, I bet they finna blow nigga
Two pounds of weed, don't act like you don't know nigga
I put that green up, like mistletoe nigga

[Outro]
Yeah boy, boy boy
Finally Famous in this, getting money
F-F ho
D-town
G.O.O.D. Music nigga
Bangladesh
Say these niggas get off my dick
These niggas sit down



[Intro: Big Sean]
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
I look up, I say I think it's time to kill it

[Verse 1 : Big Sean]
Bitch I'm sexy as fuck, you ain't even gotta tell me
I ride around to Pac, I fuck my girl to R. Kelly
I tell her make me a sandwich, no PP & Jelly
She look back like "Goddamn, what you think this? A deli?"
I'm screaming "Hell yeah trick, Hell yeah ho"
That shit make her love me more, and she know I love her too
She know I been to hell and through, I need what Reverends do
Power of the revenue got me a 2 to 10 and a 10 to 2
I gotta shine boy I be a star, on fire that's a meteor
So I'm either or on TV with a Rita Ora set your DVR
Stacking money face to face what that mean CPR
Everyday the day date, gangbang major pain
D-Town I ride around me and my dog like Charlie Brown
Just trying to get that white money you know, countin' cake and KK's
On a day to day base, then vacay for eight days
You know muthafuck taking a vacation
Put palm trees up in my house and have a stay-cation
Getting paid while I'm chilling that's a paid-cation
Full glass of champagne, Oh no, you can't taste it

[Hook]
I seen cars (switch up)
Seen Hoes (switch up)
Seen Money all switch up
When the days get dimmer
Who gone leave you there and who gon leave with ya
This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched
I ain't switch up naw naw I ain't switched up
Same me naw naw I ain't
Switch up
Same team naw naw I ain't switched up
I think it's time to kill it

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it (x3)
I said I think its time to kill it

[Verse 2 : Common]
Bought a Cadillac, now I’m Cadillac Com
She ride alright, when I'm riding right, Put Cadillac on that lawn
Might even let her meet Ye, might even let her meet Sean
Might even let her meet Push, she never meet my Mom
Chi Town is my town, I ride around like I'm lying down
Southside my eyes down, I'm the shit y'all fly around(Oww)
I’m in my mode today, sayin what the fuck I’m ‘posed to say
Moving making money, got them trashbags back
Smoke Chibahs with leaders, Pussy sweet and I'll eat her
Got strippers and divas, plus some cougars and cheetahs
Oh you with GOOD, put me on like Bonita
I said ease up, ease up, ease up
Ain’t nobody fucking with my clique

[Interlude: Big Sean]
And all these bad bitches man, they want the.. (dick).. (they do)

[Verse 3 : Big Sean]
All I care bouts my crew, my family and women
Except these women that’s hoing, and these hoes that be stealing
Trying to get them a cut, that’s how you end up with stitches
I tell a bitch quit playing, and play ya position
Either move or get devoured, fuck a coward
I be fresher than these motherfuckers head to toe
If I rocked Eddie Bauer, but I dont
Aura Gold, everything I do I do it overboard Michael Phelps splash,
Smile for the polaroid, self-employed
Now you shelf employed, D-Boy
Never sold, but I still got more lines than corduroy
And I'm with the same crew til I'm an old man
Cause there no such thing as new old friends

[Hook]

[Bridge: Big Sean]

[Outro: Big Sean]
Rollin' with the same team I ain't switched shit
Rollin' with the same team I ain't switched shit
I'm with the same OGs
The same old team,and you know my team
Ain't switched



[Verse 1: Big Sean]
They say I’m too fake, fuck it I’m paid
I can’t even find an empty spot inside my safe
I got Carties on my eyes, Louis on my case
Lobster, shrimp, and calamari right here chilling on my plate
They tell me I’m on time, even when I’m late
Even if it’s a lie they say everything is great
I’m grabbin’ the fattest asses, just to see ‘em shake
I swear I’m too real to be, I’m too real to be livin’ so fake

[Hook]
Look out!
Cause I’m just too fake for the world
I know it’s just a game to me
I’m just too fake you see
I wish I didn’t have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It’s breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don’t like it but it’s true

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
"Yeah I know Sean, I swear that nigga ain’t shit
Known him for forever and he ain’t on the same shit
It breaks my heart when all the kids be yelling 'You the mayne, Big'
He ain’t no hometown hero, he on that LeBron James shit"
Man I tell them suck my dick then choke on a nut
Cause when they see me it’s "Oh, It's Big, What's up?"
Man for the team, man, fam, or regime
Might knock down any door, open it up
Got on and now you startin’ actin’ different huh?
No really I wasn’t fuckin’ with you from the beginnin’ bruh
Here we are, here we go, my circle tighter than a Cheerio
People want a handle like silver spoons
People want a handout like here you go
Man, the realest nigga I know is inside the mirror bro
And these fools be trippin’ like a suitcase, a shoelace
They too fake, and I’m too real, yeah, boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chiddy]
Fake it til you make it
What happens when you do?
Friends turn to strangers, so I’m a stranger, too
They want this or that
Boy gotta hustle like a flip or pack
Year a go a nigga wasn't gettin' scratch
When I hit the booth I came up with a sick attack
Oh yes, feelin’ so strong we about to take the game like Conquest
Wish we fail, but they check pre-sales, and a hater gets proven wrong, yes
They just bantering, calls I’m not answering
Married to the music so I never give a hand a ring
But Chiddy jigga with these girls we be on the next
And they get mad cause we really don’t respond to text
Yeah, they say I, may be just on the shady side
Maybe I, grow so much and I smoke so much got a lazy eye
Yeah I’m too gone, this the new shit to get loose on
The boy Chiddy and Sean on a new song
If you ain’t with it, tell me what the fuck you on
I said I in heads, made it off of Big chance
Yeah and still the game can make you fake like implant
But I'm real

[Refrain 1]
Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD
Selling D, feeling like the 70s
Getting paid like we seventy

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Float around my town like it's the motherfucking seven seas
Hit the club, lose seven Gs, film it all on 7D's
Spilling liquor rest in peace, rest of my G's rest with a piece
Start the day dissecting weed, then strategize then rest my team
Same show, different seats, same game, different league
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see
Bitch

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I was thinking about the ice that I put on, money that I've blown
Bitches that I know, everything that I've done wrong
All the licks I hit, all the bullets missed
Got my shit legit, a lot of people pissed, well
I got money coming through
Drugs and women coming too
Got my family living comfortable
Got me thinking I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do

[Refrain 2]
Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD
Selling D, feeling like the 70s
Getting paid like we seventy
Use to roll around in that Toyota rolling seven deep, damn

Part 1: "Voices in My Head"

[Hook]
Voices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
(You know better, what the fuck!)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(You always do the same shit)

[Verse]
This was supposed to be the last time, last hit
Last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn
This was supposed to be the last one, last two
Last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me about
(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit

[Hook]
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)
Voices in my head saying that I knew better
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still, fuck
(That's your problem, you don't listen!)

Part 2: "Stick to the Plan"

[Bridge]
Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like
Look
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Hook]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 1]
Stay focused
Don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else you notice
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking fronting and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah, tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracting
Put that into what's worth having (boy)

[Hook]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 2]
Stay focused
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)

[Verse 3]
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started losing it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head



[Hook: Big Sean]
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I hope it's not too late
I got my whole life packed inside a suitcase
Riding in a Chevy that shoulda been a Mercedes
Trying to keep my head above water so I stayed out the Navy
I, I made a promise to my girl
So I'mma leave town and bring back the whole world
So I bought a ticket, took longer than expected
Came back around like a necklace and the first thing she said was
(It's too late)
Like "nigga I got needs too
I found a man that gave me what I need now I don't need you
I barely got a text, a call back, you old lying ass nigga
You a dog, out here chasing paper, fucking bitches, nah
Nah nigga you too late
Live with it, now you got a roommate"
My homie served ten years it's too late for him to be treated equally
Too late for him to make it out the hood legally
Riding around doing my thing
Is it too late to be trying to live dreams
And turn them all real, reality is just a technicality
So is being fake so don't tell me that I'm too late

[Hook: Big Sean]
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Alarm clock said I'm too late
And they said I'm too weak, I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long and don't look too strong
Well how long would you take
Waiting's got me here in the first place
Another second, I'd be second maybe third in the worst case
Now on display are my word plays
Moving weight - it's such a trap
Move and wait you can't do that
I know I'm dope man but I can't move crack
And it's such a fractured way of thinking 'bout your plans
But I try to bring it back before your brain hit the pan
Sean from Detroit, Lupe from Chicago-land
But both of our chains say made in Japan
German engineers designed both of the sedans
Ride with Mr. Right-On-Time or stay Ms Another Chance
Man - redirected at the girls
Not an ultimatum just an option in this world
Where things come and go when the clocks never stop
Be on time for nothing, a little late for a lot, huh

[Hook: Big Sean]
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late

[Bridge]
I hope it's not too late
I hope it's not too late
The last thing I wanna hear is too late, yeah
Tell me is it too late for me to try and change the world
Is it too late to say I wanna change girls
Is it too late even though I'm the shit
Is it too late to tell y'all to suck my dick, bitch

[Outro]
I do it, too late for what
If I want it I need it if I need it I got it
Finally Famous in this, G.O.O.D



[Hook]
Understand that what goes around comes around

And I don’t ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it’s time to go
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay
Tell me I’m all you need

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I don’t ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me it’s not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I’m all you need

[Big Sean - Verse 1]
Understand, I am
The renowned, newest talk of the town
When errybody talk and just keeps on talkin’ about
Westside! Tellin’ girls “You should call if you down”
And if my phone doesn’t ring, then leave it after the pound
Cause I be up in the air more than I do on the ground
My city is on my hat, and I’m wearin’ it like a crown (Westside)
You’re now rocking with somebody on their fuckin’ bidness
Watch me do it big, no pun intended (Boi)
See, I done seen nights turn to days
Love turn to hate, hugs turn to laids
Niggas turn to sirs, Andre to Spades
‘Cause when it turns real, that’s when everyone turns fake
Instead of saying "fuck all of y’all" and turning away
Man, I was cool enough to say “Fuck it” and let ‘em stay
Fuck, I hate to say I told you so
So buying rounds is my way of saying “told you, ho”

[Hook]

[Big Sean - Verse 2]
Now, I can’t tell what’s a better accessory
My new watch, or the chick that’s standin’ right next to me
Killin’ niggas at rap, but being the man’s my specialty
I love shitting on all my exes especially
Double shots, then reload
Let’s toast to the interns that made it to CEO
Boss player, collectin’ every single check that’s owed out
Puttin’ on a show until everything is sold out
Man, I’m chillin’ with Jays, ‘Ye’s, and Common Senses
It’s crazy when legends are peers and your competition
I would hate to be a almost nigga
I call ya that, ’cause you gossip like y’all almost bitches
You know, went to school with Jay, and was almost Jigga
Or hooped against LeBron and would almost get ‘im
Y’all niggas make me realize how good almost isn’t
Would hate to look back on my life and say “I almost did it”
Fuck that, reflectin’ on the last chain I bought
They on my tracks, waitin’ on the next train of thought
Visualizin’ how the crown might be
Got the whole rap game tryna sound like me

[Hook]

This dedicated to my ex girls, both of ‘em
It’s also dedicated to everybody who be talkin’ shit behind my back
And then when I see y’all, y’all act like “Awww, I’m so happy for you”
That’s some bitch-ass shit, nigga

Understand that what goes around comes around
(This also dedicated to everybody who’s fuckin’ winnin’ today)
And I don’t ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it’s time to go
(Everybody gettin’ it)
(After niggas said you couldn’t get it)

Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
(G.O.O.D. Music and the best)
So, baby, tell me who the best
(No I.D.!)



[Hook]
I say that shit again, I said it once before
I just, I just, I just, I just want it all
I glisten and shine with misses' fine model chick, big behind
Bad enough to skip the line but to me she just a nine
I hop up out that double-0 you can call me Mr. Bond
Bitch I am a monster, I belong in District 9
Catch me in my office, office, doing business
Fuck you doing, bullshitting

[Verse 1]
I get all the eyes when I step inside and
They all arise when I am arrivin'
Bring out the Rose, Nuvo, Ciroc and
Bring out the OJ like Johnny Cochran
I guess they on son, cause my neck look like horizon
Just a million people behind me and I don't have Verizon
Man I'm chillin with my niggas nigga, and a couple cool bitches
The fuck you doin', bullshittin'

[Verse 2]
Me and my niggas say it ain't Ton
Hundred pretty girlies singing our song
Yeah I kick my feet up you can't say that I ain't home
And I be blowing on that reefer you can't say that it ain't strong and
She just, she just, she just, she just want a long dick
I put it in her mouth and now that bitch look like a conehead
When I'm done go ahead, what the fuck this is
The fuck you doing? Bullshitting

[Verse 3]
I hear, I hear, I hear man but that shit just don't compare
I tell you you the best, when I'm looking in the mirror
By the time y'all over here, I'm prolly over there
And by the time you riding what I'm riding on I'm in the air
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy, I'm drowsy
My frequent flier miles is in the thousies I'm outtie
Somewhere chilling in Maui, swimming with the scuba fishes
The fuck you doing? Bullshitting

[Verse 4]
Nigga I be splargin, I beg my pardon
Cause y'all niggas is starving looking for a bargain
Gone and roll that weed yea I think it's time to spark it
Cause I be running through them trees niggas call me Tarzan
What you think? We won't stop! Gone stop? Silly ho
I'm living out my dreams, don't you dare hit that alarm clock
I'm laid up with your girlfriend You knocking like what u doing nigga?
The fuck you doing? Bullshitting

[Outro]
I hit you with an AMC, my nigga that's a full clip
And you could be like me if you just quit with all the bullshit



[Hook - Mike Posner]
Sometimes my mind wanders away from me
I know
I light my dutchy up puff maybe one day I'll fly
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows? (I know)
Who Knows?(I know)

[Verse 1 - Big Sean]
I wish that I could be what I want to
I wish that I would do what I don't do
I need a miracle; I hope it come through
I'm trying to work it out; I need a jumpsuit (damn)
Cause I don' 'bout had me enough of not havin' enough, slackin' and stuff
Mama on the phone not braggin' or nothin'
Cause her son ain't really got shit happenin' much
Saw my bank account like where is all the "O's" at?
Hit the club like where is all the hoes at?
Get a little change you gonna see how shit change
You gon' be up in the crib like where is all her clothes at?
And ask your girl she know it easy to say no to a nigga that's broke
But somebody with dough that got a little more?
Shit...I don't know

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
And I always had drive
Get's where I'm going if I ain't got a ride
And when they ask, "Do you do what you love?"
I'mma say, "I do" if I ain't got a bride
And I always kept Faith like B.I.G
Tryna do it big until my crib on Cribs
Man my girl ain't got to worry about shit
Cause our world is going be the shit
So she can tell her mom I'm a keeper
I am a dreamer, I could of been a king, huh
I'mma put my hands together like an applaud
And look upward, like what up Lord
I know if you try to you can turn these gray skies back to sky blue
Was made for the give and go like a drive-thru
Give us opportunity and see what we do with it

[Hook]



[Hook: Big Sean and Jhene Aiko]
You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life
I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right
(Okay, you got ahead tonight)
Man, that doesn't make it right
Man, that doesn't make it right
How do you sleep at night?

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Sean, nigga you on, damn, nigga, you on
You was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home
Damn, nigga, you did it, but damn it you did it wrong
You got time for that gig, but not time for the phone
Got it right with your ends, but fucked it up with your friends
I seen your ass up on TV,  touched up on them twins
You don't know about hard times, you clutched up in that Benz
Get tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends, whoa
Niggas want handouts, and I only got two
Now I'm on the phone talkin' to my mom like I only got you
Gettin' dressed up for court, that's a law suit
Ain't wearin' V necks, but niggas ask what happened to the crew
Now I'm in court for some shit I didn't do
Cause of my nigga, knowin' my career could've been through
So when it's time to travel management say I only need two
Listenin' to them when I'm the one that makes the rules
I'm just a victim of the life though that I ain't tryna lose
This the dream, I had a wake up call and missed snooze
Lately though my family been too happy
I just turned my mama hooptie to a new Caddy
People thinkin' I'm rich and I wish they knew that
I been signed for four years and I'm just able to do that
Worry 'bout my next Rolex time piece
My nigga Tone worry 'bout our sis, Shanice
We supposed to be the role models
No wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
Is this the example I'm tryna set?
Are these the people I'mma forget?
Are these the times I'mma regret?
Livin' life wishin' I could hit reset but, but

[Hook]
You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life
I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right
(Okay, you got ahead tonight)
Man, that doesn't make it right
Man, that doesn't make it right
How do you sleep at night?

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, you win some, lose some, break some, bruise some
Life could be a test, multiple choice, choose some
Choose one, stick with it, man, prove some
Sometimes the best teachers is ourselves goin' through somethin'
Real life will teach your ass way fucking fast
I always thought my last girl was supposed to be my last
I got four aunties, two uncles, one dad
One mom, two brothers, and 200 niggas mad
And it's only one me, divide it and do the math
I'm the one that dropped out, got no time for the class
How am I supposed to have time for everyone I just said?
I don't even have time for everything in my head
On my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot
Wishin' me and you were no strings attached, but were nots
Man thats drama, drama drama
So deep that call each others mamas' mamas
We need a break I mean comma, comma comma
I'm tryin, homie
But she always picks the wrong time like phones dyin' on me
In the bed cryin' on me, talkin' lyin' on me
It sucks to hit the internet and see you're lyin' on me

[Pre-Hook]
Fuck
Is this the example I'm tryna set?
Are these the people I'mma forget?
Are these the times I'mma regret?
Livin' life wishin' I could hit reset but, but

[Hook]
You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life
I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right
(Okay, you got ahead tonight)
Man, that doesn't make it right
Man, that doesn't make it right
How do you sleep at night?

[Outro]
See, the mind is a fucking trickster
It can fuck you 'round, but your heart will never lie to you
And that’s why people love you, Sean
Because you talk to them from the heart
(Thanks, dad)
That’s why you're magical, Sean
It’s no mistake that you’re where you are right now
You speaking that from your brain, but they hear you from your heart
Because people can see your bullshit
And I know I’m talking a lot of shit
(No, you’re not)
But I want you to hear that
Because I’m a great motherfucker, man
And I’m very modest
You know, I am
And I know a lot of shit
They know when you bullshit
They don’t even intellectualize it
They feel it
Life is a feeling process



{Young Chop on the beat}

[Big Sean]
Yup.. money, money, money

[Hook One: Big Sean + James Fantleroy]
I woke up - boy it’s time to get it
Walking to the window, saw the city
Thank God I woke up - feelin' like the mothafuckin’ realest
Living but it’s time to make a killing
Thank God I woke up

[Hook Two: Big Sean]
Tryna get it every day
Make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
(I woke up) tell these fuck boys they gotta pay
Tryna make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
(I woke up)

[Big Sean]
I woke up, woke up, thank God I woke up (yeah)
Wifey at home but I’m living life like we broke up (yeah)
You hit the hood and post up, I’m gon’ get it ‘til I’m filthy rich
My hands dirty, my gross up (gross), my money doing the toe touch
That’s stretched out, ‘til I’m in the back, stretched out, drinkin' Ace
‘cause I’m decked out, whole hood with me; need a guest house, yea a guest house
Lately I been getting like mo’ ass and less mouth
‘Cause when they see that whip (skrrt), they start to think about kids
Man, when they see this crib, they gon’ start to think about cribs
Been dealt with real life too long, now it’s time to live
Respect out the D (boi), hardly had a pot to pee in
Now I’m at the Coliseum, lil’ niggas gotta see him
Tryna be him, show you how to follow vision, real nigga
Politician, bad bitch, swallowtician, gotta get it
Yea (yea), last night I lost all that
I’ma wake my ass up, get it all back, thank God

[Hook One] + [Hook Two]

[Sayitaintone]
Now I been killing shit, I gotta say, my pit blue, my buffs gray
With a hint of white, sipping Henny white, livin' like I won’t see the night
A real playa like Pinky, when I’m in the game, I TD
And I’m all about my dollars, dollars, dollars, that’s 3D
I wake up with a bad bitch by my side
Last night, I was so drunk, I felt high
Last week, I was so high, I felt drunk
I got a bitch so bad, I gotta hit from the front
I fuck Kim K hoes, that’s Ye ‘Ye tone, smoking weed, that’s reggaeton
Get it next to free, that’s AJ tone, what’s my name
What’s my name bitch? Sayitaintone, what she saying? Sayitaintone
Who they paying? Sayitaintone, fuck sleep that take too long!

[Hook One] + [Hook Two] + [Hook One]

[Mike Posner]
I woke up this morning
Looking at the city that raised me
I can get it all now
And go get everything they never gave me

[Earlly Mac]
Like every day that I wake, I say grace for my cake
I’ma do dessert first, I don’t even gotta wait
Yea, when I hit the mall, I hit that bitch in the face
God be so good to me, I just gotta stop and pray
By the way, my jewelry appraised, it’s a couple K
On the lake, I’m out of the state, at my hideaway
Like Bruce Wayne, I’m saving the day, and I’m getting bank
I’m foolay, my bitch got bootay, ooh I love the way
I woke up, my dough up, I got out, I go nuts
I show out, I blow up, I ball out, I pro up
Ok it’s Earlly Mac off in this ho, tailor-made designer coat
Watch me take it to the bank and deposit a pot of gold
I’m foolay

[Hook One]



[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
Stay close to me, so close to me
That's how it's supposed to be
Long as you've been knowing me
You been holding me down
I'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully
I watch over you, you watch over me
And that's how it's supposed to be
And we are, alright

[Hook: James Fauntleroy and Big Sean]
Now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say its going to be, alright
Its going to be, alright
Cause, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say its going to be, alright
Its going to be, alright

Just tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be (x3)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
"Might not make it this time"
Is what not to say at this time
Sometimes, the truth ain't what you need to hear
And you tell them they alright, knowing they need a cure
How I'mma believe in paradise if I don't see the sand
Only palm trees I got is this weed off in my hand
Around the same time my mom said "Sean, you need a plan
Miss Freeman's son, across the street got shot, now she need a hand!"
Traumatized, God oh why's his momma cry
Now I gotta look up, up in his momma eyes, gotta tell this momma lies
Like, "It's gonna be alright," knowing it ain't alright
And I know it's so much pain, and there's probably more on the way

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You know I love you momma like she mine
Whether we together, or we trying
We fuck, three times, we smoke, tree times
We climb, I left, came back in town, it wasn't in time
The cancer done came, it just hit it's prime
It came from the breast, just spread to the spine
It might make her blind, she stare at the blinds:
"This can't be my mom!"
Got me thinking, "whats a girl to do, a girl to do?
When her world's a pool?
And she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames
And all the stress is all propane
She's burned again"
Hoping I could make her smile
Take cancer and David Blaine it out
POOF! Disappear, God make an out!

[Hook]

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Stay close to me, so close to me
That's how it's supposed to be
Long as you've been knowing me
You been holding me down
I'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully
I watch over you, you watch over me
And that's how it's supposed to be
And we are, alright (x3)

[Intro]
You know what you do
You know what you do
You know what you see
You know what you do
You know what you - you don't know what you do!

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
How about we pretend all these niggas not around
And get fucked up like we was out of town
Woah, then get fucked up and go get out of town
Swerve, swerve
And tell ourselves that one time doesn't count, tell me
How fucked up you down to get?
A pound? A zip? A thousand sips
Red cup yeah that college shit
Free liquor got it on scholarship
Bitch act like you don't know what's up
Act like it ain't my crew blowing up
Lose not to much champagne, no throwing up
One time for the set, please go throw it up
It's Finally Famous, overbooked, overpaid and overpriced
But don't get it twisted, that shit ain't happen overnight
Had dreams of balling now I'm NFLing
Let her spend the night, she feel like Cinderella
All she tell me is-

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
And you don't know what you do!
It's just a feeling inside me
And you don't know what you do!
It's just a feeling inside me
You don't know what you-

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get dressed up
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get messed up
Heart breaker, young heart breaker
When you get in the game I swear the whole world commentates you
But man, I don't give a fuck what they saying, I don't give a fuck about opinions
I don't give a fuck about feelings, I ain't no dentist, either I did, I do or I didn't
You could try to tell me how to live my life, I ain't hearing it
I must be doing something right if every mill comes with a spare I guess
Straight, straight, straight up out that dirt, but my t-shirt clean, ohh
Do it for the city, that's the 313
That's unnecessary, fuck her like she my secretary
Ass and face is hereditary, her momma, shit, legendary
You don't know what you do

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]

[Outro: Big Sean]
Go, go, go, go. go
Can't let that high go to waste I feel high on
Supposed, supposed, supposed, supposed, supposed
Man, watch your back I swear man some of these niggas be
Hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes
But I'mma live this like I swear that's all I know
Know, know, know, know, know, know

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Yeah, Los Angeles, "Welcome to the Terrordome"
City of Satan, angels can't even get along
No lie, my town covered in darkness
Hoping that the sun just shine on us
Rolling up the kush, now I'm letting my mind wander
Into another place, I ain't tryna go down under
Life is like a race and we all tryna finish it
Shit never fair, strays hitting the innocent
The good die young where I'm from and it's sad to say
That somebody gotta die today
Tomorrow's never promised, but we living for the moment
Nigga, time never stops, it just keeps on going
Crackers just gave my young nigga four life sentences
Twenty-five times four, nigga, do the math
And the hood never have witnesses
Cause if we did, then them shots gon' blast

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
This ain't the way my life bout to end
So I'm quick to grab on my pen and
Give 'em something my people sure to feel
Give 'em something that I know is all the way real

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Just wakin' up, mind playing tricks on me
Got the fifth on me, gotta take a risk homie
Was a ball player till the coach pissed on me
Keep it real, I could take you down the list homie
Be a tradition, see these Chucks be a mission
Burner be the fuel to the flame, the key to the ignition
If you banging, be serious, boys run up in your pad
Point-blank, period, moms ain't hearing it
Niggas said 'cuz lil nigga got blasted
Oh well, give a shit, shouldn't half-assed it
Only time you with it, when your niggas all tripping
Caught your ass slipping, now I'm stepping up my crip and steady dipping
Riding through the city in lights, living it trife
Wrong intersection, ready to fight
Hopping out with my own agenda, who the contender?
Better hope this motherfucker jam (BLAHH!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, as I'm hearing the first and second verse
I try to analyse the feeling that's felt in the song
I want to tell Rock and Q to go to church
But that's a hypocrite because I ain't been in so long
I stare at the world from a righteous point of view
And realize a crisis coming
Novocain couldn't numb it, the pain is unbearable times two
Let's rally a team, summon, and school the youth

How you feel about it?

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Man, I feel the same way as you
It hurts my soul, like a needle piercing
Through the bottom of my shoe and if you behind bars
Hold your head, pause
And if you in close range with a nigga with a gun in his waist
I pray the intervention is divine
I got a cousin in jail and handful of homies in heaven
But earlier than expected, what the hell?

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
West coast tsunami come jump inside of a wave pool
Fresh out the county with beepers over their ankles
Bitches and bugs their earlobes flooded with bengals
38 slug passenger seat let it bang you
I was born the same year you was rocking a kangol
20 years later my style favor a kangaroo
Jumping off the ground im tapping the star spangle
Banner with manners over ignorant lost angels
Cameras flash nappy hippy from every angle
Hammers will blast snap and hit you from every angle
Like a porno no homo you wear rainbow
I'm with a bad chick that can suck on my mandingo
Your making publicity stunts to make your name blow
Im dropping c4 every month to make my name blow
Drive a hoopty every month like its a range rove
Get in on the passenger side because the door broke
Take you on a natural high this is for short dope
Watch you go be outside then give you more dope
Im gonna flood the streets outside go buy a raincoat
Open the door my tapes fall out your Durango
West coast till im gone and wearing a halo
Til then im ready for war lets play halo
Take down the fifth of Hennessy and watch the day go
Bye like farewell can somebody just pray for
Me like holiest priest on gods payroll
Tabernacle to all the Church's chickens I ate on
Its K.Dot you motherfucker motherfucker mother blucka blucka bring a ruckus better duck em make you suffer quick suck a dick

[Verse 2: SchoolBoy Q]
Look, coming from gangbangers and palm trees
Eating on polly seed and bomb weed
In walla bees better let my wallet sees throwing up the set while I'm chillin in the summer breeze
You niggas really want the gun to squeeze
And im shootin from nutting
Backseat with the window down ready for ducking
I ain't riding shotgun unless I gotta shotgun fuck around and pop one leave your fuckin' top done
Like the body shop on a mardi gras
Bad little bitch keep the gat in the party bra
You know I'm ready to shoot you know I recruit give me the loot like Big Poppa who shot ya noodle niggas over cheese make pasta
Top dawg sit at the table we all mobster
Never passed english and grammar still proper

[Jay Rock]
My niggas we all gotcha

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
My niggas is all shottas
And niggas ain't nothing but bitches they all gossip
My words come hard like a bishop in tranquilizer
And murder goes hand and hand like sanitizers
I been a problem shootout to Problem

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
My gun blow then I get low
Like a stripper my nigga no homo
Take a puff of the swisher then get dozed
I do this for my niggas who is locked up in the prisons that can't get out of them systems there's no hope
So my mentality gotta be cut throat
Everytime that I spit it I provoke
Jay Rock for president go vote
Put them in a state of shock like a million votes
I'd go big before I would go broke
I got bundles of snow so come snope
Big bottles of henny who wanna toast
Big bags of green who wanna smoke
Its on me im a do it for the coast
Rock city my city till I'm gone
I'm a make it I can feel it in my bones

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, I came in with the same precision as Pablo
Your visions at moe's whip and Diablos
City on my shoulder like a poncho
And I treat the booth like el baño
Get a whiff of that
And when its show time i'll take you to the Cinemax
Los Angeles on the fitted cap
Committed like Richard Pryor and getting stacks
Yo Punch they think that history is a joke read up on how they brought Woodstock to watch for black folks
California souls, you say the west ain't unified like the LA school district you must've missed it
Riding around my old junior high high, remaniscing I have the same goals now
But I never thought for a second I needed Snoop and Dre to help me out
No debit give me all of the credit
SOUL



[Verse 1: Black Milk]
A-yo, long awaited, debated
But fuck it here we are brah
Here to save the game just like a memory card
Memory loss to Cali dro
To Amsterdam, out on the patio
Rockin like a Beatle', I should record up in Abbey Road
Bet he flow, there he go talkin' that
Hood rich, money talk, hood rich, Black male
With music that's always in the hood like crack sales
Or out in the burbs like E pills
He feels, niggas can't fuck with him
Shows, plenty fans round the globe screamin' out y'all niggas can't fuck with him
(Yep yep) Hit 'em with that new shit
Hittin' off a new chick
That want me in her mouth like a toothpick
Who flips better heat? See this shit's timeless
While y'all niggas got bad timing like teen pregnancies
Better be, better see, we coming with better heat

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Sittin on some Kobe's, smoking on a stogie
Bangin Noreaga, when I'm done I light the bogie (what, what)
Forty on the floor mat a leave ya holey moley
Banana in her tailpipe, I'll make her Axel Foley
Eatin' on pierogies, goose mixed with Sobe
Smokin' on a OZ, pimpin' like a O.G
If you never knew me, then you probably never know me
Blade on me homey mask on like Shinobi
Ball so hard, got a MVP trophy
Smoke so much kush, I forget the hoes that blow me
Thick white bitch, slurp a nigga like Kirby
Hoes on a nigga and they all look thirsty
Say they nineteen and they all look thirty
Everyday clean y'all always dirty
Chronic coming in the same bag as a turkey
Dark color purple and it's tasting like Hershey



[Danny Brown]
Used to be starvin' trying to pack a bag of ramen open
Now I gotcha bitch chokin' on this dick long strokin'
Everyday; bong smokin'
Champagne; glass toastin'
Suckin' on this sex pistol 'bout to blow her brains open

Used to fuck with rat bitches
Now I fuck with bad bitches
Fuckin' since middle school
And dog you never had bitches
Dog I came from rag to riches
Now I got your bitch permission
Squirtin' on her lips and when you home you gon' kiss her

Take a nigga head off
Like a hot mascot
Tell me why your breath smell
Like a burnin' bag of fag cock
Blowin' on some apricot
Crib like Camelot
Thinking of the days when I was countin' up my sack of rock

Leave ya with a Scarface
Cause you niggas rap a lot
Nigga you a sharpey
Homie I'm a long grenade
Found them yellow diamonds have a nigga leakin' lemonade
Nigga you bitch made
'Bout to need first aid

Dog I'm on the grind
Like an old stripper
In a room full of virgin nerds and fat niggas
Now we pack swishers
Drink straight liquor
Make ya bitch go down low and lick your sister

Ghetto ass nigga that dressed on suburban
Rap niggas gettin jerked
Ain't no Jergens
Fuck so bad in they ass fit Excursions
Detroit niggas got it wrapped like turbans



[Verse]
This bitch told me I need my teeth fixed
I said, "Nah ho, that's perfect for licking clits"
And when I said that shit that ho got wet
Like a bitch in a jacuzzi on the deck of a cruise ship
On her honey moon, looking at a full moon
Getting serenaded, sipping on champagne to set the mood
I ain't Mr. Future Husband, Mr. Future Fuck Your Cousin
Sister, Auntie and your best friend, thought she was a lesbian
Until she sucked mine, I don't care how fine
First date, tell a ho we going to 69
In your baby momma crib, smoking on some power puff
Snaggle tooth nigga, talking like Snagglepuss
In there bumping reggae, turning up the Snagga Puss
Got more kids than the arms on a "Seal"
I just get the dome, we alone, be like not the puss
She just take the bone, slurp and spit and say "I'm out this bitch"
I could never do it, the type to go and love the bitch
In the line, at the movies, holding hands, hug the bitch
I could never hate, chronic to the face
Me and my nigga got some straps like some Jordan 8's
Smoking by the weight
You ante on the 8th
Ain't talking about coke, leave a nigga child broke
You kill for car notes, autos on the porch
Ain't talking PC's when we say Tech Support
Make it run through windows, blowing on some Indo
Corn dog size spliff, hit like Kimbo
The only time Reggie on the Knicks, when you go to the corner say "Lemme get a Nick"
Now that's some pothead on some crack head shit



[Verse 1]
The present like December 25th
Getting cookies out the oven with the Louis V oven mitt
Sold work, now I'm working with the choruses
Professor X-Man would say I'm Vanglorious
Put patterns together with words I crochet
All-Madden with the flow, y'all so so gay like
Dance...dance revolution
I'm for the advance same as Kwame restitution
Eating good in the booth like wassup
Y'all in the booth sounding like potluck
We don't know what we gettin'
Brown like Pujols, always hittin'
Your bitch like a cue ball in a pool hall
We all hittin'
No kiddin', no bullshittin'
Pull my dick out and she just start lickin' like
That was her secret ambition
Put my dick on her nose now she look like Pippen

[Hook]
Niggas hit the text, say it's light on the scale
I text back LOL
Another nigga trippin', said he middleman his sales
I text back LOL
SMH, LMAO, don't text Danny Brown if it ain't about dough
LOL, LOL, if it ain't about money, TTYL

[Verse 2]
Nigga hit me on the Sidekick saying he gon' shoot me
Sounding like a real groupie
He a bitch with a heater like Lara Croft
He gone get his ass wet like Noah's Ark
Got the chopper, won't hesitate to squeeze
Get his ass cut like a whopper with cheese
Give his ass some beats, no need for MPs
Now he's in the ER hooked to IVs
Doc saying that it's over
When I watched G.I. Joe, I used to root for Kobra
Used to watch Scarface and root for Sosa
And laugh myself to tears every time the movie's over
To me, that's the perfect endin'
All my niggas sinning for the rims that be spinnin'
And did I mention that jails to us like after school detention
So revolvers, we spin them
Text a nigga like, "Come through, end him"

[Hook]



[Intro]:
I got some good shit to tell you tonight brothers and sisters

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Hotter than a BBQ at Satan's place, these bitches masturbatin' to my mixtape
I cum hard like seamen made cement leavin' feces trails on drunk kids cause I'm the shit
Pissin' on your paragraph, parallel to ferris wheel
Make your bitch pussy a blowhole she doin' well
Jelling Harvard bitches skyping while they study, now I'm in their dorm rooms, ass fatter on person
Bustin' down rap bitches, bustin' down loosies
Now a nigga grown got [?] jacuzzis
Kelly Kapowski, spittin' Romanowskis, sniffin' coke in hotel rooms off the room key
Pent house suites, swisher sweets, [?] ice buckets, no towel under the door like fuck it
Luxurious living , plus this bitch is fucking, just play Danny Brown and two words will [?]
Heart colder than heel from a polar bear, shade bear snow storm walking up a glacier [?]
Now let me make myself clear cause you can't see me
You ain't fuckin' with me period, you menstruating ah
And ever since I walked out of them greens and out them county doors, I've been living the dream which is a
Penny in a nightmare, tryna get my nike-airs and spilling rice on my high-chair

[Hook: Black Milk]
So what we got right here? Stop right here
Block right here, you is what we not like
Catch him in the spotlight, yeah

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Now you all slaves to my [?] animal shit
Heart racing off the dopamine
Morphine metaphors make you do the shoulder lean
Smoked a young dro, this grandaddy with promethazine
Curing cotton mouth
Inside my head is a haunted house and
Every time I close my eyes another rapper make it out
Used to make-out with runaways in crack houses
Now I runaway from making-out with brick houses
It's as if I fucked every bitch I wanted to
My dick got enough smoke, you can catch a contact smoke
Reefer I roll up smelling like sneakers from a reacher
Aerobics class, hour straight no breathin'
Fresh like Easter, Thanksgiving eatin'
Smoking Christmas trees and these bitches trick or treatin'
I treat 'em like Halloween candy that's why your favorite rapper, favorite wrapper probably stand me

[Hook]



[Instrumental]



[Intro]
So wake up, set your sights
For the time is right
For your role

[Verse 1]
No one can fuck with me
I feel like if the bitch could walk she will fuck me
Money over everything, under the influence
At ATM's withdrawing from promethazine fluid
I toss at night so I fall asleep sedated
Sometimes I feel like life is so over-rated
And two thing for certain, that's death and taxes
Tryna move forward doing shit ass backwards
Stand up nigga at night on his knees
Pray and sip Arnold Palmers up under palm trees
Hope to die from old age, but chance of that slim
Smoke Newport so that's going on a limb
But with my lights dim, before it be brighter
Than a stateside spotlight on a million lighters
Held by niggas wearing Puffy shiny suits
With some Daft Punk helmets and some mirrors on they boots
I'm uncouth, Eve in the garden, I fucking beg your pardon
We thirsty and starving
Hungry than a motherfucker, mouth dry as hell
Tryna make it in the city where 90% fail

[Verse 2]
Hola, it's solar, poetry polar
Got the game locked in a crowbar
Never ever sober, hot box and no cars
Watch the day pass on prescription pills Zoloft
If I don't have it, nigga I'mma go off
Razor in the coke tryna slice a nigga throat off
Nigga I'm an ogre, rap like oh god
Hitting bitches from the back camera on the tripod
In your bitch iPod, never rocked Izod
But I rock the python, choke it to your life gone
Nigga I'm amazing, no not a mason
You illuminati, nigga I'm Jason
And I stand Adjacent, dawg no replacement
Used to smoke squares roll swishers in the basement
Mama never said shit cuz she felt my pain
Feeling like crying so I wish that it rained



[Verse 1]
Rap Frank Zappa, stepping on it like a Kappa
Even at your pastor, say I got the Master Blaster
Purple like a Raptor jersey, Hershey and the Swisher Sweet
Pistol speak, if you don't listen nigga that ass'll leak
Master beef, Green Beret your style flow, casualty
Drastically, streets is saying that hip hop needed me
I'm the majesty so greet me as your highness
Sipping on the Heineken while blowing on the finest
Minusing your pocket while I'm clearing up your sinus
Hoes use vaginas try to set us up and line us
My nigga roll the chronic
Smoking on some thunder from the land of supersonic
One puff can make you vomit, but I can face a whole one
Call my nigga up when I'm broke, let me hold one
And I'm on one, 'bout to pop another
But I ain't feel it yet dawg, so let me pop another

[Verse 2]
Danny Brown the Hybrid, pilot violet to the white kids
I'm psychic, knew these bitches suck my dick and she did
I'm violent, fist go in your mouth like trident
She tried it, hit me up and came back for seconds
I wrecked it, rappers soft and have no progression
Correction, killing shit nigga, adolescence
Connection, y'all niggas begging
Testing at the dinner, turn your ass to breakfast
Intersection like some bitch undressing
Thick ho from Texas
Slurping on the exit
Gave a pearl necklace
Now where the next bitch, they all want to text this
And hope I'm sexing this
The right message, because I'm on some next shit
Caress this, put they mouth on it, put their neck in it
Desperate, spray up in their hair like Nexxus
Question, anybody know where the ex is?



[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
This beat is so cold
Yeah

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
And it's always the hardest thing
Your blood is running all in me
Wish I had a chance to write ya
I wish I didn't look just like ya
At times I think it haunts me
Cheap whisky running all in me
Wish I had a chance to like ya
Wish I didn't look just like ya

[Beat switch]

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
And won't you listen, won't you listen
Pay attention, you hear me
I'm on the roads to riches, bagging gold out the pigment
Fucking with you jokers only gave me a good laugh
Had to get them smoking but I'm puffing this good stash
Woke up in the chocha
What the fuck is my name bitch
Feeling on my aura
Holy shit I'm the greatest
Walked up in your function
Fucking up all your Lays chips
Product of the 90's I'm surprised I made it

[Hook]
And oh, oh, oh, if Papa could see me
We probably share a toast over 70's Reislings
I'm trying to get ahold of these demons
It ain't easy
And oh, oh, oh, if mama didn't love me
I'd probably be
I'd probably be robbing and cheating
Tryin' get ahold of these demons
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy (nah)



[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
My old Chevy movin' so slow
But my mind still spinnin' off of coco
Don't let a nigga get his money right
Don't leave no hair up on my sport's coat
Young nigga with a old soul
But my mind still spinnin' off of coco
Don't let a nigga get his money right
Bitch - don't leave no hair up on my sport's coat

[Verse 1: King Chip]
I told a mama make these niggas pay the fair
Have some money leftover when ya done paying me
I'm Pimp Chip something like a Pimp C
I'm out here grippin' and whippin' on wood
And ain't no way I couldn't be, bitch
I'm cold up, pulled up to the Chevron in my Chevy [?]
Tell a bitch to hop out, pump the gas, she was ready
My other stallion hopped out, they hit the store
I rolled the window down, said "Grab some backwood", she said "I know, oh"
Stupid ass nigga, I'm out here, brought the fucking doll
I pull up in the [?] and take your bitch, don't care what the fuck you ball
Stupid ass nigga, I'm out here, brought the fucking doll
My 72 [?], got some hallow, what you're hallowin' 'bout?

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
My old Chevy movin' so slow
But my mind still spinnin' off of coco
Don't let a nigga get his money right
Don't leave no hair up on my sport's coat
Young nigga with a old soul
But my mind still spinnin' off of coco
Don't let a nigga get his money right
Bitch - don't leave no hair up on my sport's coat

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Young nigga, fresh into some bitch
My white hoe, got a nose in the fun dip
Talk slick, something that she never get to hear
She talk shit, it's only with that other nigga
Ride around - speed slow, these bitches stand hard, [?]
Said, "P do you ever love em?", (Hell no!)
Nowadays can't trust, these hoes, (No!)
Ol' stupid ass nigga I'm out here what the fuck you think these hoes be poppin' that 'P' like it's the cure for pancreas disease (woah!)
Ol' stupid ass nigga, I'm out here what the fuck you think
I'll turn a basic bitch into a motherfucking MVP

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
My old Chevy movin' so slow
But my mind still spinnin' off of coco
Don't let a nigga get his money right
Don't leave no hair up on my sport's coat
Young nigga with a old soul
But my mind still spinnin' off of coco
Don't let a nigga get his money right
Bitch - don't leave no hair up on my sport's coat



[Chorus]
Them belly full, but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain will fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a cook but the food nah nuff
You're going to dance to Jah music, dance
We're going to dance to Jah music, dance, oh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Forget your troubles and dance
Forget your sorrows and dance
Forget your sickness and dance
Forget your weakness and dance

Cost of living gets so high
Rich and poor they start to cry
Now the weak must get strong
They say, Oh, what a tribulation

[Chorus]
Them belly full, but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain will fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a cook but the food nah nuff
You're going to dance to Jah music, dance
We're going to dance to Jah music, dance, oh-ooh

[Verse 2]
A belly full, but them hungry;
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A pot a-cook, but the food nah nuff
A hungry man is a angry man;
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A pot a-cook, but the food na nuff
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough
A pot a-cook, but the food na nuff
A hungry mob is a angry mob;
A hungry mob is a angry mob

[Intro: Bonez MC]
Das Kokain boomt, das Weed in mei'm Blut
Nein, ich geb' dir kein' Zug

[Hook: Bonez MC]
Meine Jungs haben nix zu verlier'n
Laserpointer direkt auf die Stirn
Wir kommen, wir sehen und exekutier'n
Attackieren, attackieren, attackier'n
Dieses Zeug geht direkt ins Gehirn
Egal, was du willst, wir sind desinteressiert
Wir kommen, wir sehen und exekutier'n
Attackieren, attackieren, attackier'n

[Post-Hook: Bonez MC]
Attackier'n, attackier'n, attackier'n!
Attackier'n, attackier'n, attackier'n!
Attackier'n, attackier'n - attackier'n, attackier'n!
Attackier'n, attackier'n, attackier'n!

[Part 1: Bonez MC]
Deine Mama hat dich immer gewarnt:
„Das sind Jungs von der Straße, die machen kein' Spaß.“
Wir bauen Druck auf und lassen nicht nach
Paffen das Gras, uns're Waffen sind scharf
Kack auf den Staat, wir woll'n Kohle kassier'n
Drogen konsumier'n, im Rotlicht agier'n
Unter den Füßen den Boden verlier'n
Während V-Männer mit den Cops kooperier'n
Ahh, auf der Suche nach Sex
Ein, zwei ostdeutsche Groupies im Bett
Die Hure, mich kennt sie von studiVZ
In Deutschland erfolgreich die Jugend verpestet
187 ist gut im Geschäft
Wer will Stress? Komm, wir pusten euch weg!
Null Toleranz für dein' Hurensohn-Rap
Die Palmen aus Plastik, die Kugeln sind echt

[Hook: Bonez MC]
Meine Jungs haben nix zu verlier'n
Laserpointer direkt auf die Stirn
Wir kommen, wir sehen und exekutier'n

Wir kommen, wir sehen und exekutier'n
Attackieren, attackieren, attackier'n

[Post-Hook: Bonez MC]
Attackier'n, attackier'n, attackier'n!
Attackier'n, attackier'n, attackier'n!
Attackier'n, attackier'n - attackier'n, attackier'n!
Attackier'n, attackier'n, attackier'n!

[Part 2: RAF Camora]
Du wolltest uns warnen, aber hier
Hat keiner Angst vor dir
Du solltest besser deine Stadt alarmieren
Denn wir werden kommen und attackieren
Bleib Winner, weil ich niemals verlier'
Raben hinter mir wie eine Kavallerie
Camora kam nachts - eine Slut fantasiert
Mieser Arsch, also wird attackiert, attackiert
Roboter, willst du sehen, ob ich blute?
Weder Blut in der Vene noch in der Wunde
Volles Magazin in meiner Wumme
Eliminiere hundert Hater pro Sekunde
Attentat à la Lennon
In mei'm Kopf ein Armageddon
Testament auf mein Blatt Papier
Doch bevor ich gehe, wird attackiert, attackiert

[Hook: Bonez MC]
Meine Jungs haben nix zu verlier'n
Laserpointer direkt auf die Stirn
Wir kommen, wir sehen und exekutier'n

Attackier'n, attackier'n - attackier'n, attackier'n!
Attackier'n, attackier'n, attackier'n!

[Part 3: Hanybal]
Wir attackieren von allen Seiten wie Piranhas
RAF, Bonez, Hanybal
Unter Palmen aus Plastik
Wird's ratzfatz drastisch, wenn einer sein' Hass kriegt
Fliegen plötzlich Flaschen
Hektik machen wegen Beshlik-Faxen
Feinde im Tagteam klatschen
(„Hol ma' Grey Goose!“) - ich muss Benzin tanken
Ich attackiere und zerfleische mein' Feind
Wie ein Kannibal und teile dann das Fleisch
Scheiß' auf die Scheiße, die ihr reimt
(„Schatzambauis“) - wir sind die Heißesten zurzeit
Palmen aus Plastik, Keulen aus Wax
Es wird wieder Beute gemacht
Den Beutel verpackt und verteilt in der Stadt
Attackiere den Markt, weil ich Scheine so mag

[Hook: Bonez MC]
Meine Jungs haben nix zu verlier'n
Laserpointer direkt auf die Stirn
Wir kommen, wir sehen und exekutier'n
Attackieren, attackieren, attackier'n

Egal, was du willst, wir sind desinteressiert
Wir kommen, wir sehen und exekutier'n
Attackieren, attackieren, attackier'n

[Post-Hook: Bonez MC]
Attackier'n, attackier'n, attackier'n!
Attackier'n, attackier'n, attackier'n!
Attackier'n, attackier'n - attackier'n, attackier'n!
Attackier'n, attackier'n, attackier'n!




[Intro: Bonez MC]
Bei Nacht
Zieh' vom Blunt, bis er mich high macht
Die ganze Welt ist meine Heimat
Heute Moskau, morgen Thailand

[Hook: Bausa]
Heute Honolulu, Baby, morgen Paris
Voulez-vous, voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ah ah ah oui?
Ma petite chérie, nein, ich fall' nicht auf die Knie
Morgen heißt es wieder bye bye, ciao ciao, arrivederci
Heute Honolulu, Baby, morgen Paris
Voulez-vous, voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ah ah ah oui?
Ma petite chérie, nein, ich fall' nicht auf die Knie
Morgen heißt es wieder bye bye, ciao ciao, arrivederci, Baui

[Part 1: Trettmann]
Hotel, Motel, Holiday Inn
Paris, MoBay, Zwischenstopp Miami
Okay, okay, komm, schließ die Jalousien
Schäl' dein'n Body aus den High-Waist-Jeans
Volles Magazin, Turn-up in deiner Punny
Sagst, „Komm, schieß!“, verballer' meine ganze Muni
Du zerreißt 'n Euroschein, eine Hälfte steck' ich ein
Falls wir uns nicht wiedersehen, morgen nach der Uni
Gönn' mir noch ein Zug von dem Ses
„1 Night“ wie Lil Yachty und dann bin ich weg
Kann nichts dagegen tun, kein Disrespekt
'Cause mi nuh stop love how di gal dem a flex
Kauf' keine Liebe, das hier ist alles echt
Hab' Frauen überall, doch noch nie dafür geblecht
Bin mir sicher, dass ich dich nicht vergess'
Girlchild, du bist was besonderes

[Hook: Bausa]
Heute Honolulu, Baby, morgen Paris
Voulez-vous, voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ah ah ah oui?
Ma petite chérie, nein, ich fall' nicht auf die Knie
Morgen heißt es wieder bye bye, ciao ciao, arrivederci, Baui

[Part 2: RAF Camora]
Chill'n zu zweit im Mondschein
Will nicht dein Idol sein
Verlasse deine Bude, wenn der Tag anbricht
Denn ich will nicht bei dir wohn'n, nein
Die Welt ist mein Appartement, ich flieg', flieg'
Jetzt in meinem Pyjama mit Easy-Jet
Flieger ganz hinten bringt Chicks in den siebten Himmel
Nach Kabinen-Sex, yes
Glaube nicht an Liebe oder Wunder (Wunder)
Gib mir deine, gib mir deine Nummer (Nummer)
Wir werden uns nur einmal sehen und nie wieder mehr (ey)
Nie wieder mehr, nie wieder was zu tun haben (ey)
Ein neuer Tag, ein neues Spiel
Die Karten werden neu gemischt (gemischt)
Morgen ist schwer zu berechnen
Es kommt nur drauf an, was heut geschieht, denn

[Bridge: Bonez MC]
Bei Nacht
Zieh' vom Blunt, bis er mich high macht
Die ganze Welt ist meine Heimat
Heute Moskau, morgen Thailand

Ey, komm mit auf ein' Trip in mein Cabriolet
Nizza, Marseille, über Saint-Tropez
Die Rückbank ist frei, komm, steig ein, ist okay
Egal, welche Richtung, das Ziel ist der Weg
Ey, komm mit auf ein' Trip in mein Cabriolet
Nizza, Marseille, über Saint-Tropez
Die Rückbank ist frei, komm, steig ein, ist okay
Egal, welche Richtung, das Ziel ist der Weg

[Part 1: RAF Camora]
Ah! R-A im Alfa, forza Italia
Komm mit und mach dir kein' Kopf wegen Outfit
Wenn du willst, komm im Pyjama
Fahre entspannt an der Küste
Seh' 'ne Chay, die ins Cabrio möchte
Baby, komm, mach dir die Brüste
Ich mach' dir den Löw und den Mario Götze
Vermisse mein Meer, vermisse mein' Sand
Mein Berlin wird im Winter zur Eiszeit
Skylines hinter den Palmen
Mein Cabrio startet, wird Zeit, dass du einsteigst
Bass wummert im Subwoofer, das Stadtzentrum im Nightlife
Hundert Euro im Tank, der Motor im Gang, fehlt nur, dass du einsteigst

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Ey, komm mit auf ein' Trip in mein Cabriolet

[Part 2: Bonez MC]
Fünfzig Gramm Ott verstaut in unserm Kofferraum
Fahr' auf die Tankstelle rauf, hab' ein Loch im Bauch
Wir sind grade erst losgefahren - komm, lass uns noch ein bauen
Ist das die Realität oder doch ein Traum?
Das Wetter wird besser, wir fahren Richtung Süden (Richtung Süd, Baby!)
Sehen oben am Himmel die Kraniche fliegen
Hab' mein Handy auf Flugmodus, zu viel Gebühren
Wir passieren die Grenzen, hab'n nix zu verlieren
Der Beat pumpt durch die Speaker, hören das Mixtape von Masicka
Komm, wir stoppen in Paris und gehen shoppen mit der Visa
Nagelneue Sneaker, ein farbenfrohes T-Shirt
Digga, zieh ma' am Sativa, diese Tage komm' nie wieder

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Ey, komm mit auf ein' Trip in mein Cabriolet

[Part 1: RAF Camora]
Wir woll'n die Welt oder gar nix, renn' quer durch die Matrix
Doch erkenn' keinen tieferen Sinn, eh
Unter Palmen aus Plastik wurde Geschichte geschrieben
Lass das erste Kapitel beginn', yeah
West-Wien, Smog in meiner Lunge
Der Fünfzig-km/h-Roller dreht seine Runden
Kenne jeden Stein meiner Stadt, selbst von unten
Kenne jeden Club und die Jungs mit den Kutten
Die Rapstudios, die sich in dem Business versuchen
Lieder nach Lieder, Reggae bis Heavymetal
Doch kein Song verlässt das Revier
Immer und immer wieder derselbe Level
Wird Zeit, sich von hier zu verzieh'n

[Hook: RAF Camora & Bonez MC]
Ciao ciao – bleibt, wo ihr seid, Mann, ich seh' nur den Weg vor mir
Laufe ohne Fessel an den Bein'n, eure Gegenwart ist jeden Tag auf Ketamin
Ciao ciao – steig' weiter hoch und weiß nicht, wann's ein Ende gibt
Laufe ohne Fessel an den Bein'n von der Kreisliga rein in die Championsleague

[Part 2: Bonez MC]
Hmm, Hamburg-West, bestes Ott in der Lunge
Einfach so ein'n Pitbull gekauft, lauf' 'ne Runde
Weiß nicht mal, wohin, ich hab' die Schule verkackt
Hab' kein'n Masterplan und kein'n Ausbildungsplatz
Aus Langeweile volltätowiert – Hartz IV
Ist voll viel Papier, Mann, was wollt ihr von mir?
Führerschein verlor'n, ich war leider high
Raptexte schreiben nur ein Zeitvertreib
Und meine Mama ganz verzweifelt
Fragt sich, was wird nur aus ihrem Sohn?
War der Beginn meiner Reise
Es tut mir leid, Jungs, haut rein, ich muss los

[Hook: RAF Camora & Bonez MC]
Ciao ciao – bleibt, wo ihr seid, Mann, ich seh' nur den Weg vor mir
Laufe ohne Fessel an den Bein'n, eure Gegenwart ist jeden Tag auf Ketamin
Ciao ciao – steig' weiter hoch und weiß nicht, wann's ein Ende gibt
Laufe ohne Fessel an den Bein'n von der Kreisliga rein in die Championsleague

[Outro: Bonez MC]
Bleibt, wo ihr seid, bei euch ändert sich nix
Nein, große Depression und kein Ende in Sicht
Ciao ciao – ihr habt nix zu berichten, wenn man sich trifft, oh nein
Also bleibt, wo ihr seid, denn es ändert sich nix
Ciao ciao

[Part 1: Bonez MC]
Mir geht es super, wenn ich im Spiegel meine Fresse seh'
Voll gesund mit Gold im Mund
Fühle mich wie 2Pac, nein, es könnte mir nicht besser gehen
Komm, wir gehen shoppen auf dem Flohmarkt
Gebraucht, aber günstig
Oder fahren um die Blocks mit unsern Mofas
Steig auf, es wird windig
Ich hab' so viel geraucht, mir wird schwindlig

[Bridge: Bonez MC]
Digga, gestern war ich pleite, heute zähl' ich Scheine
Geht mir besser, wenn ich teile, anstatt nur für mich alleine
Manche gehen, manche bleiben, dankbar bin ich beiden
Gibt kein'n Grund, sich hier zu streiten, denn

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Alles könnte anders sein
Guck dich doch mal um, wem geht's besser als dir hier?
Zeit für bisschen Dankbarkeit
Setz dich in die Sonne, roll das Weed ins Papier, ja
Der Sekt könnte Champagner sein (ahh)
Die Steine Diamanten sein (ahh)
Der Fiat Panda könnt' ein Manta sein, nein
Alles könnte anders sein (ey)

[Part 2: RAF Camora]
Endlich zufrieden mit dem, was mich umgibt, ey
Realisiere immer mehr, dass das Leben mich liebt, nah
Mehr Gras, als ich rauche, mehr Platz, als ich brauche
Mein Pass lässt mich passieren, jedes Land ist mein Zuhause
Bin 1,90, in Topform, trainiert
Immer fresh, Bruder, Nike hat mich sponsorisiert, ey

[Bridge: RAF Camora]
Bruder, gestern war ich pleite, heute zähl' ich Scheine

[Part 1: RAF Camora]
Auf der Suche nach Stress in der City
Dresscode: Sergio Tacchini
Nächtelang Dates, Ecstasy-Deals
Die Fake-Krokodile sind aus Tschechien verbilligt
Lächel' für 'ne Chay, immer klappt meine Masche
Verkack', denn ein Bre zapp­za­rapp ihre Tasche
Üben auf Rooftop Kicks, tun als wär'n wir Cro Cop
Mehr Handys im Sack als ein Callshop
Mama kauft Pasta für alle
Mama gibt Tipps sowie Mafiazitate
Sommerlang Cash sammeln, bis es wieder Winter wird
Heut seh' ich aufs Meer und erinner' mich
Ich erinner' mich
Tausend schwarze Raben, hab' sie hinter mir

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Und wieder mal merk' ich, wie diese Straße verbindet
Längst übermalte Tags in den Gassen erinnern, was war
Sie erinnern dran, dass wenn ein Mann eines Tages erblindet
Es lang nicht bedeutet, dass dieser Mann hier niemals was sah
Niemals was sah

[Part 2: Bonez MC]
Aus Taschen voller Kleingeld wurden Bankkarten
Keine Zeit, selbst Mama sieht mich nur auf Plakaten
Hab' so viele Krokodile, die in meinem Schrank warten
Bin im Tourbus, spiel' Karten, rauch' ein' Blunt und geh' schlafen
Viele Jungs von damals hängen draußen auf den Straßen
Denken, ich hätte sie verlassen
Was für ein Schwachsinn! Ey, ich bin einfach nur gewachsen
Sie fangen an, zu hassen und mein' Lack zu zerkratzen
Ab nach Sankt Pauli, raus aus der U-Bahn
Jeder Tag war ein Ausnahmezustand
Es war ein Leben ohne Hindernis
'Ne geile Zeit, ich erinner' mich - Bonez!

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Und wieder mal merk' ich, wie diese Straße verbindet
Längst übermalte Tags in den Gassen erinnern, was war
Sie erinnern dran, dass wenn ein Mann eines Tages erblindet
Es lang nicht bedeutet, dass dieser Mann hier niemals was sah
Niemals was sah

Teufel

[Intro: Tommy Lee Sparta]
My gun is all I have, me no need you
How you fi tell me, me no bad, me no believe you
Step inna you place me alone, no mek me see you
And unleash a demon you never see before

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Ich habe das alles so gewollt, dieses Leben
Kein Zurück mehr, kenne keine Tränen
So viele gingen schon verlor'n auf meinen Wegen
Mein Herz wurde Stein, ich merk' nicht, dass sie mir fehlen
Niemals am verlieren (Evil, Evil)
Sie bekomm'n, was sie verdienen
Raben, die mir dienen (legions – demon, demon)
Bonez, Camora, Sparta attackieren

[Part 1: RAF Camora]
Mama sagte mir: „Schieß, bevor sie es tun.“
Keiner will Peace, sie wollen dein Blut
Gefallen vergisst man schon nach dem Gefallen
Der sicherste Weg ist, wir killen sie alle (alle, alle)
Sie flüchten vor Hektik
Ich nicht, denn ich fühl' mich lebendig
Friede verweichlicht
Lieber sterb' ich im Krieg und werd' wiedergeboren als Haifisch

[Pre-Hook 1: RAF Camora]
Geh mir aus dem Weg, er wird zum Tatort
Ich laufe über Leichen – fühlt sich an, als wär' es Marmor
Glaub' nicht an die Liebe, ein Stich in die Niere
Ist mir lieber als ein Pfeil von diesem Hurensohn von Amor

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Ich habe das alles so gewollt, dieses Leben
Kein Zurück mehr, kenne keine Tränen

People a run, dem a hide in house
Every snake we a venom them now
Violate Sparta we summon you a ghost
Then deliver your grass to the goat
Stirb, Motherfucker, stirb, stirb – let's make a toast
To me friend dem weh love kill the most
Spirit inna sky a float
Bank lock so me no tek check
Duppy we mek when we mek step
Send a gal so dem no expect
She lef him a chill – Netflix

Every fake bad man wah cut
Bwoy and him gal run out a luck
So me buss out dem bomboclat head and cut, hmm

[Part 3: Bonez MC]
Du nennst mich „Bruder“, ich bin mehr als nur dein Freund
Aber läuft es aus dem Ruder, zünde ich Kerzen an für euch, Brüder
Oh, warum bin ich so geworden?
Wäre für viele schon gestorben, wurde mehrfach nur enttäuscht
So viele klopfen an die Tür, weil sie mich suchen
Alle wollen sie ein Stück von meinem Kuchen
Neunmillimeter für die Hater
Rauche eine Kippe, gucke zu, wie sie verbluten
Und ich bin so wütend, doch ich lächle
Siehst du das Gold in meiner Fresse?
Sie verwechselten Güte mit Schwäche
Jetzt bring' ich den Tod, aber wollt' nur das Beste

[Pre-Hook 2: Bonez MC]
Und jetzt bin ich wie ich niemals war
Verballer' blind ein Magazin – *la-da-da-di-da-da*
Und die Bullen komm' mit Tatütata
Denn es waren wieder mal die 187er

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Ich habe das alles so gewollt, dieses Leben
Kein Zurück mehr, kenne keine Tränen

Bonez, Camora, Sparta attackieren

[Part 4: Tommy Lee Sparta]

Yao!

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Killer bleibt Killer
Spieler bleibt Spieler
Real erkennt real
Also mach hier keinen Film, denn es glaubt dir hier niemand
Killer bleibt Killer
Kinder bleiben Kinder
Girls tanzen dir den Harlem Shake
Doch im Hotel merkst du, dass gar nix geht

[Part 1: Bonez MC]
Schicker Bademantel, liege auf dem Bett
Instagram-Chat, ich verliebe mich direkt, he
Unterkiefer Gold, Sonnenbrille schwarz
Keine Lust auf Hurensöhne, komme auf den Arsch
Vom Verlierer zum Gewinner, 187er für immer
Killer, Krokodil - Schnapp
Es gibt niemand', der mich hindert, dicke Titten implantiert
Ihre Muschi rasiert, Makatussin inspiriert und esse Sushi nur frittiert
Während deine Bratans sich Lidschatten malen
Hänge ich mit Badmans, die Skimasken tragen
Rauche mit paar Rastamans Weed auf Plantagen
Und du kleiner Bastard markierst hier den Harten

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Killer bleibt Killer
Spieler bleibt Spieler
Real erkennt real
Also mach hier keinen Film, denn es glaubt dir hier niemand
Killer bleibt Killer
Kinder bleiben Kinder
Girls tanzen dir den Harlem Shake
Doch im Hotel merkst du, dass gar nix geht

[Part 2: RAF Camora]
Bei mir wecken deine Ansagen jeden Instinkt
Doch ich rieche Angsthasen gegen den Wind
Ohne Hype, ohne Deal mach' ich Cash jeden Monat
Schon eine Million aus paar Texten vom Nokia
Im Chat wollen Groupies dann Sex in der Sonne
In echt alle Thunfisch, direkt in die Tonne
Friede sei mit dir, auch wenn die Gute 'ne Schlampe ist
Ich besuch' sie mit Blumen im Artemis
Test', wen du willst, aber niemals den Raben
Knie in den Magen bei Feature-Anfragen
Nix mit vertragen, nix mehr zu sagen
Außer Spieler bleibt Spieler, Killer bleibt Killer, ey!

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Killer bleibt Killer
Spieler bleibt Spieler
Real erkennt real
Also mach hier keinen Film, denn es glaubt dir hier niemand
Killer bleibt Killer
Kinder bleiben Kinder
Girls tanzen dir den Harlem Shake
Doch im Hotel merkst du, dass gar nix geht

[Part 3: D-Flame]
Ja, genau, echt lange nix gehört
Und jetzt pass auf, wie die Flamme dich zerstört
Ach, kein Sinn, du hörst nicht genau hin
Deswegen hat deine Frau 'n ander'n Dick im Maul drin
Dein Dummgelaber int'ressiert mich keinen Meter
Der Blick vergeht, ich kann nix dafür, ich bleib' ein Hater
Was meinst du damit? Das kann heutzutage jeder
Es gibt ein' Unterschied zwischen Opfer und 'nem Täter
Ich habe schon Pussies gekillt
Da wurdest du noch von der Mutti gestillt
Ich und meine Jungs machen uns in deiner Villa breit
Schicken dich ins Zimmer, weil Killer immer Killer bleibt




[Hook: Bonez MC & RAF Camora]
Alle machen jetzt auf Mörder
Weil dein Freund hat ein'n Freund, dessen Freund hat ein'n Ballermann
Eine Kugel in dein'n Körper
Bei dir läuft, deine Boys rauchen Joints vor der Kamera
Und sie sagen böse Wörter
Weil ein Freund, dessen Freunds bester Freund hat ein'n Ballermann
Zweite Kugel in dein'n Körper
Noch ein letztes Mal Snapchat!

[Part 1: Bonez MC]
Sie schieben gerne Welle, aber wollen alle kein' Krieg
Sind Kriminelle, aber hab'n nicht mal 'ne Quelle für Weed
Direkt aus dem Urwald, Aktien auf der Straße
Vom Sheytan verurteilt, gewachsen auf Plantage
Egal, welche Uhrzeit, ich pack' es auf die Waage
Krokodil auf meiner Jacke, 187 auf der Fahne
Mir scheißegal, wer du Hurensohn bist, denn du wirst nie ein Teil meiner Crew
Menschen wie du interessieren mich nicht, denn davon gibt es leider genug

[Hook: Bonez MC & RAF Camora]
Alle machen jetzt auf Mörder
Weil dein Freund hat ein'n Freund, dessen Freund hat ein'n Ballermann
Eine Kugel in dein'n Körper
Bei dir läuft, deine Boys rauchen Joints vor der Kamera
Und sie sagen böse Wörter
Weil ein Freund, dessen Freunds bester Freund hat ein'n Ballermann
Zweite Kugel in dein'n Körper
Noch ein letztes Mal Snapchat!

[Part 2: RAF Camora]
Sie drohen mir mit Plastikfiguren, hab'n für'n Drive-By kein'n, der fährt
Freizeitsoldiers im Undercutlook - sag, wer nimmt euch denn ein'n Prozent ernst?
Eure Waffen sind aus Kunststoff, made in China
Nicht mal dreihundert Views, selbst mit dickem Feature
DJ, gib mir ein'n Pullup, alle mein'n, sie seien Killer
Tanzen durch den Club wie ein Medizinmann
Neun Kugeln in den Thorax für alle fake Fifties
Für mich sind sie wie Borats, sie entertain' Kiddies
Alles dreht sich um den Dollar, wir dreh'n Runden aufm Roller
Man ist Killer oder Opfer, alles andre bleibt Image
Drum singen wir:

[Hook: Bonez MC & RAF Camora]
Alle machen jetzt auf Mörder
Weil dein Freund hat ein'n Freund, dessen Freund hat ein'n Ballermann
Eine Kugel in dein'n Körper
Bei dir läuft, deine Boys rauchen Joints vor der Kamera
Und sie sagen böse Wörter
Weil ein Freund, dessen Freunds bester Freund hat ein'n Ballermann
Zweite Kugel in dein'n Körper
Noch ein letztes Mal Snapchat!

[Part 3: Gzuz]
Die Leute schreiben: „Gzuz, sei ma' bisschen netter!“ (nö!)
Ich putz' die Kugeln, meine Alte aufm Stepper (ja!)
Suche mir ein'n Feind und seine Scheibe wird durchlöchert
Bleibe ein Verbrecher, scheiße auf euch Rapper
Pistole an mein' Bauch, Patrone steckt im Lauf
Ich nehm' die Drogen, deine Kohle und die Frau (ja!)
Gzuz 187, das' ein lebenslanger Hustle
'N bisschen Sport und eine Jägermeisterflasche
Cabriocheck, Glas wird geext
Na klar gibt es Sex, weil ich parshippe jetzt
Knall' sie einfach in der Parklücke weg
Wichs' ihr in die Fresse und frag' sie, wie's schmeckt

[Hook: Bonez MC & RAF Camora]
Alle machen jetzt auf Mörder
Weil dein Freund hat ein'n Freund, dessen Freund hat ein'n Ballermann
Eine Kugel in dein'n Körper

[Intro: Bonez MC]
Zu sechst im Mercedes
Weil alle Jungs müssen mit
Ein bisschen Sekt für die Mädels
Und auf hundert ein'n Fick
Kein Gesetz, keine Regeln
Lass uns Kohle verdien'n
Weil so lässt es sich leben
Und niemals ohne mein Team

[Part 1: RAF Camora]
Ich schließe die Tür des Apartments
Wenn die Party komplett ist
Monika, Sarah, Belinda
Von Instagram auf meine Guestlist
Menthol in der Kippe, Soda im Drink
'Ne Chick will, dass ich für sie „So lala“ sing'
Sie will mich intim
Ich kooperiere nicht ohne mein Team!
Die Sonne scheint durch die Gardine
Hautfarbe: Ovomaltine
Kokain in der Kabine zu zweit
Der Tod hat die Todespapiere verteilt
All meine Arabs sind heute Latinos
Chica, ¿qué pasa?, die Boys sind amigos
Sie passt mir den Joint, lass' die Homies dran zieh'n
Gesmokt wird nie ohne mein Team!

[Hook]
Nie ohne, ohne mein Team

[Post-Hook: RAF Camora & Bonez MC]
Ballern, ballern
Nicht um zwölf Uhr, aber dreizehn Uhr ist schon okay
Ein'n jallern, zwei jallern
Ab dreizehn Uhr ist schon okay
Ein Glas Yamazaki
Nicht schon um zwölf, aber eins ist okay
Jeden Tag eine Party

[Part 2: Maxwell]
Trete nicht auf, nicht ohne mein Team
Keiner hier nimmt uns die Philosophie
Alles betäubt – Lidocain
Frag nicht, wie viel ich am Kilo verdien'
Ein Chick in der Linken, ein Chick in der Rechten
Wir sehen uns beim Echo, Liste von Maxwell
Bring mir den Rum, eine Kiste vom Besten
Brauch' kein Hotel, Baby, ficken im Backstage
Was heute passiert, wird morgen verdrängt
Lass' mich am Strand von der Sonne verbrenn'n
Sie komm'n mit den Cops, ich komm' mit der Gang
In Sachen Gewalt sind wir zu konsequent
Alle aus Ghana sind heut Brasilianer
Prince Boateng von der Copacabana
Koma sein Vater, die Drogen sind clean
Alle woll'n mich oben-ohne bedien'n, doch nie ohne mein Team

[Hook]
Nie ohne, ohne mein Team

[Intro (nur im Video)]
Bonez MC: „Ey yo, RAF, Digga, sorry, ich komm' 'n bisschen später, ja? Ich werd' schon wieder aufgehalten hier.“
RAF Camora: „Alles klar, kein Stress, wir seh'n uns gleich bei'n Palmen, lass dich nicht ärgern!“

„Whoopa, welcome to paradise, motherfucker!“

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Unter Palmen aus Plastik
Am Meer aus Benzin
Ohne Sand, aber macht nichts
Drehe Runden aufm Roller
Wird 'n bisschen kalt, wenn es Nacht ist
Ich verbrenne mein Weed
Unter Palmen aus Plastik

[Part 1: Bonez MC]
Sommer
Über den Dächern meiner Stadt riecht die Luft nach Marihuana
Der Benz frisch gewaschen, Baby, Kokosnussduft
Tausend Fotos im Suff, was für 'ne Karriere!
Heute druff, morgen sind wir Millionäre
Fünfhundert Pferde, ich gucke in die Sterne
Schicke einen Gruß an meine Jungs in die Ferne
Haramburger Kiez, Sonne aus der Röhre
Fingernagel fake und die Hautfarbe Möhre
Meine Welt ist aus Plastik, doch macht nix, ich wäre
Auch 187, wenn es diesen Hype nicht mehr gäbe („ihr Fotzen!“)
Sie bringt mir Cornflakes und Hörnchen ans Bett, wieder lässt sie mir keine Wahl
Und die ganzen Nachbarn hör'n uns beim Sex, aber mir ist es scheißegal

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Ich häng' auf mei'm Kiez
Unter Palmen aus Plastik
Am Meer aus Benzin
Ohne Sand, aber macht nichts
Drehe Runden aufm Roller
Wird 'n bisschen kalt, wenn es Nacht ist
Ich verbrenne mein Weed
Unter Palmen aus Plastik

[Part 2: RAF Camora]
Sommer
Über den Dächern meiner Stadt riecht die Luft nach Marihuana
Der Alfa mattschwarz wie die Raben in der Luft
Die Sonne scheint hinter der Skyline wie niemals am Ballermann
Wird es heiß, wird Berlin zu meinem Panama
Hab' ganz Wien hinter mir wie David Alaba
Statt mit Vatos Locos häng' ich ab mit Arabern
Palmen aus Plastik, aus Silikon sind die Bräute
RA wie 'n Ghost ganz oben am Gebäude
Chill' am Balkon, rauch' Blunts und ich träume
Mein Meer klingt wie Motorgeräusche
Lebe nur meinen Traum, wenn er echt ist
Filme gibt es tausend auf Netflix
Die Sonne macht die Haut braun wie Nesquik
Countdown zu Zukunft, Camora ist endlich lebendig

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Ich häng' auf mei'm Kiez
Unter Palmen aus Plastik
Am Meer aus Benzin
Ohne Sand, aber macht nichts
Drehe Runden aufm Roller
Wird 'n bisschen kalt, wenn es Nacht ist
Ich verbrenne mein Weed
Unter Palmen aus Plastik

[Bridge: RAF Camora]

[Part 1: RAF Camora]
Wir sehen die Grenzen nicht und wenn ich ehrlich bin
Realität ist für mich eher wie ein Actionfilm
Alles zu schnell für mich - seh' keine Challenges
Geld in der Tasche, meine Friends werden Enemies
Vergieße nie Tränen - nein, nur den Whiskey, Hennessy
Frauen kommen und gehen ohne Liebe, ich verletze sie
Sportwagen glänzen auf den Streets, geb' extra Speed
Entweder Vollgas bis zum Ziel oder Rest in Peace
Wir haben alles und auch nichts
Atme Rauch, worauf warten wir noch? (ey)
Tornados woll'n mich mitreißen, falle nicht um
Ich warte auf die Ruhe nach dem Sturm

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Die Ruhe nach dem Sturm
Die Ruhe nach dem Sturm
Die Ruhe nach dem Sturm

[Part 2: Bonez MC]
Sie kreuzen meinen Weg, mit ihren gebleichten Zähn'
Nun, ich weiß nicht, wie sie darauf kommen, dass ihre Meinung zählt
Bin wieder mal live on stage und auch dieser Hype vergeht
Ich führe Gespräche mit meinem Mercedes, der vor der Einfahrt steht
Kommt mir vor wie ein endloser Traum, stecke fest zwischen Frauen und Jacky
Kann nicht mal meinen eigenen Händen vertrauen, denn ich seh' sie kaum vor lauter Konfetti
In der Blüte meines Lebens, jap, die Zeit geht so schnell
Mein Schädel schläft nicht, alles dreht sich, so wie ein Karussell
Fülle mein Glas auch mit Rum, rauche mein Gras lieber pur
Und freu' mich auf die Ruhe, auf die Ruhe nach dem Sturm

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Die Ruhe nach dem Sturm
Die Ruhe nach dem Sturm
Die Ruhe nach dem Sturm

[Outro: Bonez MC]
Wir stehen im Licht und wissen nicht einmal, wie hell es scheint
Nein, es wird nie wieder Dasselbe sein
Wir sind nicht Teil einer Geschichte, wollen sie selber schreiben
Haben entschieden: es wird nie wieder Dasselbe sein
Wir stehen im Licht und wissen nicht einmal, wie hell es scheint
Nein, es wird nie wieder Dasselbe sein
Wir sind nicht Teil einer Geschichte, wollen sie selber schreiben
Denn es wird nie wieder Dasselbe sein

Talent nuh sell a shop
Yuh haf fi born with talent
And yuh haf fi love music
Seen, yuh see me
Me is a youth, me study

[Bridge: Trettmann]
Lemon Haze und Hennessy
Vodka Red Bull sugarfree
Mädchen, du bist zuckersüß
Hm-mhm

[Hook: Trettmann]
Ich heb' mein Glas auf den Selecta
Jeder Song, der heute läuft, ist ein Treffer
Die ganze Bande salutiert, sprengt das Areal
Alle gehen fest, los, spielt das Ding nochmal
Komm, heb dein Glas auf den Selecta
Jeder Song, der heute läuft, ein Volltreffer
Girls bubblen upside down, morgen ist egal
Alles kaputt, los, spiel das Ding nochmal

[Part 1: Trettmann]
Hm, der Selecter hat's verstanden
Ay, der Selecter spielt das Anthem
Die ganze Nacht nur Perlen und Diamanten
Beste Medizin für Raver und die Kranken
Die Gangster und Modelle und die Schlampen
Woll'n nie wieder landen, KitschKrieg sichert die Flanken
Der Selecter ist der Boss, er ist der Leader
Ich rolle Spliffs und reich' sie ihm rüber
Die Party schießt, *brrra*, größtes Kaliber
Hotgirls aufm Flur winden sich im Fieber
Es war noch nie so schön wie jetzt, das is'n Fakt
Mein Baby is' in Takt, whined für mich Tik-Tak

[Pre-Hook: Trettmann]
Zeig mir nochmal, wie du den Flur berührst
Auf deinen Jordans balancierst
Es brenn'n tausend Bengalos in meinem Kopf
Jedes Mal wenn du den Flur berührst

[Hook: Trettmann]
Ich heb' mein Glas auf den Selecta
Jeder Song, der heute läuft, ist ein Treffer

Alles kaputt, los, spiel das Ding nochmal
(Alright!)

[Part 2: Bonez MC]
I like to move it, move it, krieg' schon nichts mehr mit
Mein Glas auf den Selecter, besser spiel den nächsten Hit
Zack in die 90er, wie mit 'ner Zeitmaschine
Ich mach' den Roboter, verziehe keine Miene
Dance, ey, wer nicht tanzt, ist nicht mein Freund
Schande über euch und nimm die Hand von meinem Joint
Ich bin zwar groß, doch wie Napoleon ein King
Komm, wir steppen auf die Fläche, kleine Choreo, kein Ding
Die Backen wackeln, ich bin paralysiert
Braune Augen wie ein Reh und einen Arsch, dass man stirbt
Bauchnabel gepierct, ihre Haut ist tätowiert
Selecta gibt uns Kartel und der Raum hier explodiert

[Hook: Trettmann]
Ich heb' mein Glas auf den Selecta

[Part 3: RAF Camora]
Selecter spielt nur besteste Ware
Nicht dasselbe wie die letzten zehn Jahre
Er wirft die Songs, so als wär's 'ne Granate
Danach pull-up, pull-up, etliche Male
Gib mir ein pull-up, pull-up, ich nehme die Pulle, Pulle
Spiel was von Future, kein'n Bock auf alte Schule
Sie tanzen wie auf YouTube, warten, dass ich gucke
Ich grüße sie mit ­„Kuku“, klär' sie in 'ner Minute
Der Abend wird teuer, Haarspray und Feuer
Der Besitzer von dem Laden schiebt total Paranoia
Nimm das Mic, bisschen hosten
Komm und mach 'n Foto mit dem Ghøst, du kannst es posten, ey

[Hook: Trettmann]
Ich heb' mein Glas auf den Selecta

Ich nehm' 'n Zug von meinem Vaporizer
Zieh' nochmal und schwebe weiter
Hab' vergessen, wann ich je so high war
Ohne Tabak, ohne Paper, Alter
Ich nehm' 'n Zug von meinem Vaporizer
Zieh' nochmal und schwebe weiter
Hab' vergessen, wann ich je so high war
Bullen raffen's nicht und gehen weiter

[Part 1: Bonez MC]
THC im ICE, gutes Zeug im Flugzeug
Noch ist Platz im Cinemaxx, wenn du mit deiner Crew rollst
Critical und OG-Kush, ständig mit den Rude-Boys
Bis zu fünfzig Gramm am Tag, wenn es bei uns gut läuft
Super high auf Stufe drei, optimier' auf Stufe vier
Nie ohne mein'n Vaporizer, weil er ist so gut zu mir
Kein Taser, keine Knarre, du denkst, ich trag' 'ne Waffe
Aber zucke nur durchs Viertel mit Ersatzakku am Gürtel
Weniger Schadstoff, weil einfach mehr Geschmack
Auf weißen Nikes lauf' ich high durch meine Stadt
Rauche nur pur, rund um die Uhr
Und jeder kann es riechen, aber keiner, der es rafft
Ich mach' mein'n Vapo an und sag' der Welt „Tschüss!“
Er ist mein Freund, gibt mir grünes Licht
Montag bis Freitag mein Gegengift
Kein andres Leben, niemals für mich

Gönn' mir noch was von dem silbernen Haze
Oder 'nen Ast hawaiianischen Schnee
In meinem Kopf der ganze Cirque du Soleil
Scarlett Johansson hängt am Trapez
Ein Hoch auf das Pax-Life, Hombre, ich leb's
Steig' auf wie Bill Gates, höher als Emirates
I cherish the day, sing' Duett mit Sade
Treff Howard Marks, er fragt mich, „Wie geht's?“
Hm, bester Stoff, höchster Grad in der Kammer
Vape mit Hotgirls, heißer als der Sommer
Sie spielen Fanger, tanzen Bogle zu Rihanna
Singen *na-na-na-na-na-na-na*
Mach' meinen Vapo an, sag' der Welt „Tschüss“
Er ist mein Freund, gibt mir grünes Licht
Montag zu Freitag, greif' zum Gegengift
Kein andres Leben, Bruder, nein, nicht für mich

2016, smoke wie'n Roboter
Mundstück aus Chrom in der Bocca
Weiß sind die Zähne, clean meine Lunge
Vaporisiert ist der Dschungel, ah
2016, smoke wie'n Roboter
Dope aus Marokko, Koks aus Bogotá
All meine Sorten im Glas fermentiert
RAF, Bonez, Tretti vaporisiert, ah

Mein erstes Auto, ich bin stolz
Die Zähne gold, die Kette Holz
Und immer noch kein Konto, doch was soll's

Es gibt nichts zu bereuen
Seh uns zu, wie wir rollen
Wir tun, was wir wollen

Nein, rein gar nichts zu bereuen

Wie Keith Murray I get lifted
Rauch' deiner Frau den Spliff weg
Lila Scheine in mei'm Hipbag
Du fährst nur Trittbrett
Sonne geht auf, über zweihundert Sachen
Keiner mehr vor uns, hinter uns Schatten
Genießen all das, was wir früher nie hatten
Lassen uns überraschen
Es hört nicht auf, Hombre
Wir hab'n 'nen Lauf, Hombre
Es hört nicht auf, Hombre
Denn wir hab'n 'nen Lauf, Hombre

Lass die Reifen quietschen
Fenster auf, pump' 187
Ey, von mir aus kann alles so bleiben
Das Herb so gut, gönn' mir noch einen
Switzerland, Südseite Alpen
Kick back, relax' unter Palmen
Egal, wie viele Meilen
Hater werden's nie peilen
Schau' nach oben, deut' die Zeichen
Mein Song im Radio, alle weinen

[Hook: Trettmann]
Es gibt nichts zu bereuen

Du hast heut was vor, Baby
Uns gehört der Abend
Wir sind wieder in der Stadt und
Roll'n durch deine Straßen
Wir holen dich ab
Schwing dich in den Wagen
Mach die Nacht zum Tag, yay
Morgen kannst du schlafen

[Part 1: Raf Camora]
Es reichen die ersten Blicke
Ich schrieb dir meine Nummer und ein Herz aufs Ticket
Du standest beim Konzert in der Mitte
So begann das erste Kapitel, ey
Rendezvous in Amsterdam, Zimmer 206 im Fünf-Sterne-Hotel
Ich wusste schon von Anfang an: es war mehr als nur Sex, du warst mehr als ein Fan
Mein Bargeld in der Tasche würde reichen für 'n Kleinbus
Drum egal, was wir wollen, wir hol'n es gleich und
Mit dir konnt' ich immer lachen wie mit mein' Jungs
Bis es wieder hieß, ich muss los, die Zeit ruft, ey
Frag nicht, wann wir uns denn wiedersehen, bin bald wieder auf Tour im Norden
Nimm dir nichts vor, wenn ich komme, das volle Programm bis zum nächsten Morgen

[Hook: Trettmann]
Du hast heut was vor, Baby
Uns gehört der Abend
Wir sind wieder in der Stadt und
Roll'n durch deine Straßen
Wir holen dich ab
Schwing dich in den Wagen
Mach die Nacht zum Tag, yay!
Morgen kannst du schlafen

[Part 2: Bonez MC]
Du und ich, wir sehen uns immer nur einmal im Jahr in deiner Stadt auf meiner Tour
Wir hab'n uns im Hotel getroffen, weil ich dich so gerne mochte, kauft' ich dir paar Schuhe
Du bist nicht wie die andern, weil du weißt, ich komm' zurück, und darum lässt du mich in Ruhe
Denn man trifft sich wieder, selbe Stelle vor der Bühne -wann? Nächstes Jahr auf Tour!
Komm, wir fahr'n in meiner Limo deine Straßen entlang
Ein paar Cocktails und Kino, unser Abendprogramm
Komm, wir verballern mein Gage zusammen
Fünf Gramm Hamburger Gras in den Blunt
Sag mir wieder, wie gut blasen du kannst
Ich schlafe wie ein Stein mit dei'm Arsch in der Hand (ratzfatz)

[Hook: Trettmann]
Du hast heut was vor, Baby
Uns gehört der Abend
Wir sind wieder in der Stadt und

[Part 3: Trettmann]
Man müsste mich schon umbringen oder wegsperren, ist Liebe ein Verbrechen?
Denk immer noch an dich, auch wenn's 'ne Weile her ist, hab' dich nie vergessen
Deine Stimme tut so gut, ich muss dich wiedersehen, los, komm, lass ma' treffen
Und genau dort weitermachen, wo wir damals aufgehört haben, das wär' am besten
Weißt du noch, beim letzten Mal, wir haben uns kurz angeschaut, wussten was wir vorhaben
Du hast mich mit zu dir genommen und mir dein Tattoo gezeigt, du in deinen Jordans
Wir hab'n kein Auge zugemacht, in den Pausen Spliffs geraucht bis zum nächsten Morgen
Ich hoffe, du erinnerst dich, denn heute wird's genauso bis zum nächsten Morgen

[Hook: Trettmann]

[Producertag]
Kitschkrieg

[Part 1: Trettmann]
Wach' auf am Morgen, greif' zu mei'm Logo-Shirt
Doppel XL, so als wär' ich Larry Bird
Fühl' mich so göttlich in schneeweißem Cotton
Nie wieder jahrelang dieselben Klamotten
Bin mein eigener Designer, scheiß auf alle Trends
Bastel' mein'n Fans ein Shirt aus Hater-Comments
Feier' BBK, JME, Skeptas kleinen Bruder
Mach' Mula mit dem Merch, nicht mit weißem Puder
DIY, zehnmal Kitschkrieg, fünfmal Trettman HiFi
Falte die Kartons, Autogrammkarten anbei
Kleb' alles zu und pack's ins Duffle Bag
Ich geh' zur Post und schick' alles in die Welt
Brauch' kein Prada, Gucci, Tommy Hilfiger
Seh' gern genauso aus wie die Crew, meine Hitta
Reblog schicke Styles auf Tumblr oder Twitter
Doch eigner Kram ist schicker

[Hook: Trettmann]
Bester Zwirn, schönste Farben, alles taugt
Der Stoff fühlt sich so gut an auf meiner Haut
Meine eigne Marke, alles andere ist out
Shirts, die ich trage, die Crowd trägt sie auch
Cap ins Gesicht, schlag' den Kragen auf
Bin kein Model, Hombre, nein, doch seh' überragend heh
Meine eigne Marke, alles andere ist out
Shirts, die ich trage, die Crowd trägt sie auch

[Part 2: Bonez MC]
Dreifarbige Snapbacks, Logo drauf gestickt
Und die neuen Hoodies mit dem Kroko sind der Shit
Check mal unsern Onlineshop, wir hab'n alles da
Coole Bauchtasche, kein Merchandise, noch ein Accessoire
Dicka, überfrische T-Shirts und seit neustem auch für Frauen
Mit 187-Etikett, das Outfit ist ein Traum
Mein Stoff, der jedem steht, kommt in edler Qualität
Nur solang der Vorrat reicht, gleich ist es zu spät
So viele Designer, aber keiner, der es bringt
Weil die Billigware stinkt, komm zu 187 Ink
Unsre neue Kollektion ist wieder farbiger, sympathischer
Die Meinung von mei'm Grafiker und ich sag', „Alles klar, Dicka!“
Komm, füll die Regale auf, mein Bruder macht das Lager
Und ich brauch' keine Berater, ich bin Lagerfeld sein Vater
Wir machen jetzt Karriere, werden Merch-Millionäre
Ein Imperium, das ich vererbe, wenn ich sterbe

[Hook: Trettmann]
Bester Zwirn, schönste Farben, alles taugt
Der Stoff fühlt sich so gut an auf meiner Haut
Meine eigne Marke, alles andere ist out
Shirts, die ich trage, die Crowd trägt sie auch
Cap ins Gesicht, schlag' den Kragen auf
Bin kein Model, Hombre, nein, doch seh' überragend heh
Meine eigne Marke, alles andere ist out
Shirts, die ich trage—

[Part 3: RAF Camora]
Sind deine Shirts kein CØRBO, Djunge, hol sie dir, Bruder
Top Produktion biologisch
Guck mal, du machst ein Euro Gewinn, doch bist modisch 'n Loser
Der Zwirn kommt aus Tokio wie Cros in Shibuya
Die Brands und Motive sind mehr alt als fresh
Fick den H&M-Standard aus Bangladesh
Weißer Rabe frisch gebrandet auf der schwarzen Cap
Meine Couch beult sich aus von den Stapeln Cash
Besuch' die Druckerei Camora, er observiert
Designer immer top, per Photoshop programmiert
R.A. Ragucci, klarer Vorteil wie'n Designer zu heißen
Fuck high fashion, ich will mir die Scheiße nicht leisten
Meine Crowd ist wie ich, halb Mensch, halb Roboter
Deine trotz 50-Cent-Shirts ängstliche Opfer
Zerlege jede Kollektion in Einzelteile
Corbo-apparel.com, hab' meine eigene Seite, ah

[Hook: Trettmann]
Bester Zwirn, schönste Farben, alles taugt
Der Stoff fühlt sich so gut an auf meiner Haut
Meine eigne Marke, alles andere ist out

[Intro]
Boogie Down Productions will always get paid
We'll take the wackest song and make it better
Remember to let us into your skin
Cause then you'll begin, to master
Rhymin' rhymin' rhymin'

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Criminal minded, you've been blinded
Looking for a style like mine you can't find it
They are the audience, I am the lyricist
Sometimes the suckers on the side gotta hear this
Page, a rage, and I'm not in a cage
Free as a bird to fly up out on stage
Ain't here for no fronting just to say a little something
You suckers don't like me cause you're all about nothing
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My all-around performance gets better and better
My English grammar comes down like a hammer
You need a style, I need to pull your file
I don't beg favors, you're kissing other people's [ass]
I write and produce myself just as fast
Keep my hair like this, got no time for Jheri curls
Attracting only women, got no time for little girls

[Bridge]
Cause girls look so good but their brain is not ready
I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman cause her mind is so steady
So here we go

[Verse 2]
I'm not a musical maniac or b-boy fanatic
I simply made use of what was upstairs in the attic
I've listened to these MC's back when I was a kid
But I bust more shots than they ever did
I mean this is not the best of KRS, it's just a section
But how many times must I point you in the right direction
You need protection when I'm on the mic
Because my mouth is like a 9 millimeter windpipe
You're a king, I'm a teacher
You're a b-boy, I'm a scholar
If this was a class, well it would go right under drama
See kings lose crowns but teachers stay intelligent
Talking big words on the mic but still irrelevant
Especially when you're not college material
Wake up every morning to your Lucky Charms cereal
DJ Scott La Rock has a college degree
Blastmaster KRS writes poetry
I won't go deeper in the subject cause that gets me bored
It's a shame to know some MC's on the mic are fraud
Saying styles like this to create a diss
But if you listen, who you dissing?
I am a musician
Rapping on the mic like this to me is fine
Cause if I really want to battle I will put out a nine
You can see that Scott La Rock and I are mentally binded
In other words we're both Criminal Minded

[Verse 3]
We're not promoting violence, we're just having some fun
He's Scott La Rock, I'm KRS-One
Never off-beat cause it don't make sense
Grab the microphone, relaxed and not tense
You waited, debated, and now you activated
A musical genius that could not be duplicated
See I have the formula for rocking the house
If you cannot rock a party do not open your mouth
It's that simple, no phony cosmetics for your pimple
Take another look because the gear is not wrinkled
The K, the R, the S, the O, the N, the E
Say a rhyme for 87 not no 1983
Well versed, to rehearse, in my rhymes I might curse
Originality is first but the suckers get worse
Allow me to include I have a very stable mood
Poetic education of a high altitude
I'm not an MC, so listen, call me poet or musician
A genius when it comes to making music with ambition
I'm cool, collected with the rhyme I directed
Don't wanna be elected as the king of a record
Just respected by others as the man with the solution
An artist of the 80's came and left his contribution
On wax, relax, there's 24 tracks
After years of rocking parties now I picked up the knack
Because everything that flows from out my larynx
Takes years of experience and bottles of Beck's
I cannot seem to recollect the time I didn't have sex
Is it real or is it Memorex?
I'm living in a city known as New York State
Sucker MC's gotta wait while I translate
I hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads
People with ambition and straight up musicians
Although our lives have been so uprooted
I haven't included, you can all get zooted
So take each letter of the KRS-One
Means Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
You look at me and laugh, but this is your class
It's an all-out discussion of the suckers I be crushing
So now you are awakened to the music I be making
Never duplicated, and also highly cultivated
Don't get frustrated cause nothing has been traded
Only activated, it came out very complicated
Not separated, from my DJ
You see my voice is now faded
I'll see you folks around the way

Criminal minded (Repeat x4)



[Verse 1]
I don't think you understand
That what you're doing is not so cool
You think it's funny to mess with my mind
Don't you
You know I like you so you just tease me
You give me just enough to hang on and on
When you're just wasting my time

[Hook]
You're simply wasting my time
So quit wasting my time

[Bridge 1]
Do you hear me when I say
Oo oo oo oooh

[Verse 2]
So let me ask you something
Do you think I'm pretty or don't you
Do you wanna get with me or not and now...
Or are you just wasting my time

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And what have you got to say
Well things have got to change
See this just isn't right
I don't wanna have to fight
And I think I better go
Cause this ain't working out anymore
And I'm sorry, sorry, sorry

[Bridge 2]
Understand
That what you did was
Just not so cool, baby
You're just not that cool



[Bow Wow] (Talking)

Twenty thousand square feet, see that’s a private estate
Helicopter pad for when I make them private escapes
So when it’s time to get that money nigga, I’m never late
I’m still the prince of the O-town

Hopping out different whips

[Hook]

Until I come
Until I come in
Don't stop, don't stop now
Just keep on goin'
Until I come
Until I come in

[Verse 1]
Playing hard to get when we're together
Hard to get there on your own
When will you ever come to conscience
I'll let you be alone
You never had it better
Than when I was with you, baby
'Scomeback to earth
Let's drink some tea and smoke some herb

[Chorus]
Don't stop, don't stop now
Just keep on goin'
Until I come
Until I come in
Don't stop, don't stop now
Just keep on goin'
Until I come
Until I come in

[Verse 2]
Now I know it takes three balls to juggle
Fifty cents of humour's worth
When and how did I become my mother
Am I getting on your nerves?
Lets just not talk about it
And fill the blanks with space
Go to the park later
Get some ice cream

[Chorus]
Don't stop, don't stop now
Just keep on goin'
Until I come
Until I come in
Don't...
Don't
Just keep on goin'
Just keep on goin'

Don't stop

Just keep on goin'
Until I come
Until I come in
Stop



Last year, my Latin professor caught me tucking my copy of Marcel Proust’s Swann’s Way into my backpack as class started, remarking, ‘Nobody reads Proust for fun.’ What, then, should we think of the Rap Genius-crowned Proust of rap? Since his early-career mixtape surge and first two studio albums, Lupe Fiasco was in the running for Least Fun Person of the 2010s, and on Tetsuo & Youth, we hear a man freeing himself of whatever self-imposed burdens turned him into a recurring BigGhost punch line

After a quick instrumental introduction, the all-too-familiar frenetic piano and angelic vocals of Cortex’s ‘Chanson D’un Jour D’hiver’ emerged, a sure-fire sample for success if any in hip-hop. From here, Lupe never ceases to make every word effortless, necessary, what could only come from the knowledge that this is your last monument from one of rap’s strangest major-label eras. It is a triumphant victory lap, but not one that was crafted as such. No, this was Lupe Fiasco looking to make an album worthy of a victory lap

What many rappers fail to understand is that beats are not just vehicles to disguise lyricism, they’re musical representations of what your lyrics are conveying. For Lupe’s producers, they delivered. From the aforementioned Cortex sample to the triumphant violins on “Prisoner 1 & 2”, the trumpets and ethereal elongated synth notes of “Body Of Work” to “Little Death”’s bass grooves, the first half of the album alone gifts the ears with beats sure to be jacked for many-a freestyle mixtape. The dystopian warbles of the mammoth “Chopper” speaks as much to the confusing state of American double-standards as does the brutal hook, “Filet mignon with my food stamps / Car cosigned by my mama / Medical card from Obama / Background check for a chopper”. But this is a Lupe Fiasco album, and it succeeds only as far as his lyrics go. And my, do they go

In our exegesis of the first chapter of Lolita, we uncovered layers that contain metalayers ad infinitum. Tetsuo & Youth is no different. On the song “Madonna (And Other Mothers In The Hood)”, even a chance line contains multitudes; “And it’s hard when these niggas steal, mama” reminds me of the Jay Electronica line “You either build or destroy where you come from”, where both lines are transformed by the way one reads them and the cadence by which the rapper flows them. This is an album of feeling, of analyzing, but most of all, one of experiencing. Tetsuo & Youth works because of a synthesis rarely found on Lupe Fiasco’s last few works, one between astounding beats that never overstep his lyrics, but instead carry even the most obscure lines into chant-worthy happenings. You’ll return to Tetsuo & Youth because this is an album in every sense of the word, a journey undertaken by a man who spoke and rapped for others for so long, who finally found the joys of once again doing so for himself

[Verse 1]
I'm in the zone
Don't feel like staying home
Cuz for now i don't wanna be alone
I'm feeling like it's my day
There's no better time to party than a Friday
Pick out my clothes call my friends
Pop some dro, now let's begin

[Hook]
Wenting out getting out not staying in the house
Call my friends make some plans

'Cuz you'll never ever know when your time is up
So you've got to live it up

[Verse 2]
Now it's about 10 o'clock
Before I leave I'll have some Henny on the rocks
Pick out my fit you see, some fitted jeans

Grab my CD's so i can blast it through the streets
Pick up my homegirls a cop a touch
Get it twisted while we're on our way into the club

[Hook]
Wenting out getting out not staying in the house

Live your life with absolutely no regrets
No need for contemplating death
'Cuz you'll look back and miss everything that you have and
Party for the night, do what you gotta do
If you need some encouragement i ain't even mad at you
Do what's right and know that everything will be alright
It'll be alright
Celebrate life, celebrate hustling
Pop some dro' for all our money doubling
All my ladies that stick to the ruggedness
Smoke some dro' with cats that stay thugging it
It's our life we gon' live it up
Party all night till we see the sun coming up
Celebrate the weekend

[Hook]
Wenting out getting out not staying in the house

Get out the crib have some fun
Enjoy yourself live for once
'Cuz you'll never ever know when your time is up
So you've got to live it up

Niggas want me to busta rhymes, so ironic
It's Busta Rhymes, so iconic
Niggas can't fuck wit the kid, you know the logic
Bounce dookie should move, 'fore we make it a topic
I'm shitting on niggas to where I need a colonic
Or when I'm showing up and only collecting the profit
Sha, sha, sha, que sera is how I picks it up
Making niggas put holes in the wall is how I rip shit up
'Tron, a lil yak and some kush is how I mix it up
I love the way she gets down on her knees and how she licks it up
The way a nigga give you the shit and how he thinks it up

Clap off, clap on, bitch see we back on
Wall in the west wing, hang all my plaques on
I be blacking in this bitch 'til the whole track gone, King Kong
Got 'em bouncing off the walls, ping pong
Rolls Royce Wraith seats, I'm resting my back on
Bottles of 1942, getting my drank on
Funny how my mommy say she love my new rap song
How a nigga keep it fresh, Balmain slacks on
Now that's wrong, she ripping off her new black thong
Now she bugging, shorty, can't believe the dick that long
Collapse on the couch inside of my mansion
Wish y'all niggas could've really seen my reaction

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Now, there ain't no way that you could kill the beast dead
I got Middle East women and Middle East bread
I got oil well money in the desert playing golf
Dolce shorts, dashiki with a Louie Scarf
Chest cold, diamonds make a nigga wanna cough
In Dubai, 20 million on the villa loft
And then I step up in the club and then these other niggas mad as shit
The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic!

[Hook: Ron Browz]
La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo
Hili b'Allah, hey, hili bay yo

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Seven star hotels, Maybach, movie sick
Big bitches, knock-kneed camel-toed groupie shit
Women walk around while security on camelback
Club on fire now, niggas don't know how to act
Sittin' in casinos while I'm gamblin' with Arafat
Money long, watch me purchase pieces of the Almanac
Y'all already know, I got the streets buzzin'
While I make you bow down and make Salaat like a Muslim

[Hook: Ron Browz]
La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo
Hili b'Allah, hey, hili bay yo
We getting Arab money
We getting Arab money

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
See, now I take trips to Baghdad dummy
While I use stacked chips and count Arab money now
I don't need to get fresh, about to grow a beard duke
So much cake even the money look weird too
Domestic bread, and I'm broad, I'm tryna eat right
Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Al Saud
They respect the value of my worth in Maui, Malaysia
Iran and Iraq, Saudi Arabia!

[Hook: Ron Browz]
La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo

[Hook: Kokane]
Likes to go, eventual
Lead you home, come inside
Why you got your ass on your shoulders
Now, tryin' to spit at a bitch
I lead inside
Why you got your ass on your shoulders

[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah bitch put on an outfit, dazzle ya hair
Come in the club fit to take you home and frazzle the hair
Bitch understand I must have got a handle in here
Why you open up ya ass and let me travel in there
Create a scandal in there
Don't talk, let me pull it out to add another angle in there
Let me ride the back of yo ass like a camel in there
Pussy hot like she lit a fuckin' candle in there
Remember I was tryin' to get my drink in the slot
And you was same girl actin' all stinkin' the spot
It was funny how I thought I wasted breath on the broad
A friend couldn't find her cause shorty left with the God
And then I took her back to the crib, you can figure it out
I'm diggin' it out with the dick in her mouth
Get cha' homegirl to come start lickin' ya out
And swingin' about until I start kickin' em' out
Because ya...

[Hook: Kokane]

[Busta Rhymes]
I'm sayin' she fuck a nigga like she want the God to lay in a hearse
Makin' me curse, hope you relate to my verse
And what be makin' it worse
That they be the same bitches frontin' like they wasn't with it at first
Actin' too good for niggas with your ass on your shoulders
But now you'll be fuckin' a nigga till he fall in a coma
I remember how you acted in the front of ya friends
As I remember now you give me head in front of my Benz
So now I'm smackin' it up, while you backin' it up

Get cha' homegirl to come start lickin' ya out

Because ya...

I made a decision, despite all the things that we go thru
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed

Let me talk to you, when it feels
Like the sun ain't shining bright enough
It's like the devil's trying to work to give????
And though I'm blessed
I still gotta handle of things I go through
It's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you
Someone you know that knows you, and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to, and vent your frustration
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere
When you need 'em the most, are they really ever there?
See, every thing be all good when we be havin' fun
The difference is really needing a friend than having one
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve it
Look at hear, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell ya
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value
I got a clearer view, and being that
You're always here for me I'll be here for you

I made a decision, despite all the things that we go thru
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed

Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'
Even though we probably link up every now and then
With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend
Something that we allow that I don't even have to mention
Is whether or not you got me
That's something that I never question
Sometimes I feel that the people
That I love don't appreciate me
And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately
See you was here, when it started to haywire
You're still here, walkin with me going thru the fire
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too
On everything that I believe and I appreciate it you
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearin' me out
But I thank you for just bein' there and for hearin' me out
I got a clearer view, I thank
God that you're here for me and I'm here for you

I made a decision, despite all the things that we go thru
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed

I, look in your eye, and I see the pain in it
Life's a game, maybe the game did it
I know I changed, they say the fame did it
Life's changed, maybe the game did it
Two friends, now in two different places
And the mister catchin' planes, and you catching cases
Friendship, we never based it on position
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I would come to town and never get up, with you
Around then, things weren't so simple
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through
Outside chatter, messing with our mental
On the chase of???? trust, you can't forget to
It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to
No matter how far, just know that I'm with you

I made a decision, despite all the things that we go thru
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed

I made a decision



[Busta Rhymes]
Yo - me and my niggas and my clique be gettin mad cream
Ball in the club, now I'm drunk havin a bad dream
This muh'fucker tried to greet me with wealth
I never knew that I would see that day that I would meet the devil himself
This nigga was eagerly waitin to prove it
Astonishingly, already dancin to his own burial music
Well anyway, he plottin' to do it to me
In a certain kind of way, and started off directly poppin shit to me
While he spoke a couple of fires would spark
While he sat in the shadow talkin his shit we watched the sky gettin dark - he said

[Devil]
Well isn't you (?) where it hurts, I'll leave you in a rock sample
Straight up leakin in the back of a church
Then I ghost ya crib and haunt you like a ghost in your home
Leavin you old and decrepit like them ruins in Rome
Watch your body shrivel up and turn your ashes to smoke
Fuck your flesh don't get yo blood sucked, the blood of ya foes
I be that nigga that'll torture your spouse
And leave a thousand body bags like truth.com in front of your house

[Busta]
Got me buggin on a whole' nother level
Tell me how the FUCK a nigga really end up havin beef with the devil
Shit bugged the whole effect the nigga had on my dreamin
Body reactin mentally, goin to war with the demon
Semi-chaotic like a typical storm
So embellished in the dream a nigga felt it in the physical form
The dream got my nose runny and shit
Eyes watery, shorty watchin my body twitch funny and shit
Givin shorty sleepin with me the creeps
She buggin off how a nigga just sweatin and breathin so hard in his sleep
Determined to conquer this nigga so let it begin
Absolutely focused on killin the demon within
So now we fight in the name of my brethren
And every blow connect durin the fight you can hear the thunder roll into heaven
Inhale a deep breath of fresh air
The devil's presence blows a cold draft leavin a scent of death in the air
While my mind was reassemblin now
Simultaneous wifey watchin a nigga body tremblin now
Couldn't conquer me so now the devil wanted me dead
Stabbed a nigga with the same bone he ripped from his head
Yo it's funny how the devils'll test us
But it's only select, niggas blessed with somethin so miraculous and precious
Til I'm dead I'm always battlin through
You disbelieve then cut my main vein that all my blood be travelin through
Somebody got to die, settle the score
Because it's me or this nigga, I'm fighting to the death
I'm ready for WAR!!!!!!

(*devil laughing fades*)



[Hook: Stevie Wonder]
Been through the storm, through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
You see the luxuries in life, with the fortune and fame
Like them Cadillacs with sunroofs mayne
So many ways to make a dollar
Huh, sometimes I think about my father
You see my poppa was broke, and my momma was young
Tryin to blend in with them city folk
Every day landlord knockin down my do'
Wonderin where my next blessing is comin from

[Busta Rhymes]
My momma and poppa, moved to the U.S. as Jamaicans
Struggled to get visas and green cards through immigration
Though my pop was po', stayed away from crime and malice
Hard living gave him hard hands and callous
As a young'n, peep how much they loved each other's space
His hard hands rubbin against the pretty skin of my mother's face
Dig for treasure 'til his hands looked like hands of a junkie
So coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey
On the other hand, mommy was the type to work two jobs
Never enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed
Got older, developed ways of grippin the steel
Barely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal
Seek refuge in the alleged land of the free, lookin
Blendin in with city folk, down in Flatbush Brooklyn
Feel a little of my pain, follow and sing to it
Homey I seen it all, if you ain't knowin I been through it
In other words I

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Got a little older, late teens, me and my crew would huddle
On the corner late nights, plottin to escape struggle
Nights got cold and still would hustle in the same place
In front of Pancho Delis, now the freeze up on a nigga face
1987 Reaganomics ever curious
To visit other cities, out of town kick was serious
Guayanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on
Whatever slinger came back, quickly brought me right along
Nigga ran away from home
Doin different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on
Wreck is all for the good, gettin into shit
Like we innocent, actin older than we should
Walk around broke in the hood, watchin all the rich niggas
These younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggas
Thinkin 'bout my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin
To hell with just gettin by and economizin
It's kinda hard bein humble in the belly of struggle
Doin things that probably get you in trouble
That's why we stay up on the block, gettin money while we keepin it safe
In front of churchgoers keepin the faith
Mom and pop be worryin for they son
Despite they struggle and their honest livin look and see just what I become
A scavenger, in brute pursuit to be happy, another young'n that's wildin
Across the line until somebody tryin to cap me - ohhhh shit {*gunfire*}

[Outro: Stevie Wonder - singer slower with more ad libs]
I been through the storm
Through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
Woooooooooooooo-whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yeahhhhhhhhhhh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Street niggas, what up? Stack riches, no doubt
We got the block locked take another route

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes (Rah Digga)]

(Chorus)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes (Rah Digga)]
(Switch it up like Ak-Nel while you hit a dry spell
Cats like you get no reply on the Skytel)
Hate y'all (raps like Eminem hate Britney)
Bonafide (MC) who (fuckin' with me?)
Top niggas better give props nigga
('Fore you get dropped) fuck around and get your shit popped nigga
Flip-flop niggas, you could (really get your shit mopped)
Or left to lay up in a pit stop nigga

Shit'll have that) who could rock (the raw best award, nigga)
Look it up (cook it up) shook it up (book it up)

Now motherfuckin case closed

Spaz out because I motherfuckin say so
Before I blow this bitch like we down in Waco
Thick in cock diesel, that's the way we roll
Big truck shit, even my bitch whippin' the Range Rov'
We 'bout to skyrocket and THE WAY WE GO
The way the bitches lookin love THE WAY WE BLOW
Check it, we light shit up like Broadway yo
The crack-head rappers better just say no
Before I turn stupid and back the heat slow
Lay and wait for niggas in the back street yo
Weak flow, take your shit like I'm comin to Repo
Create a crowd scene and stack a bunch of people
We bustin through the doors, shootin through your peephole
The shoot that never miss is like shootin a free throw
All you niggas better go and..

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Call the ambulance, come and pick up your people
Call the ambulance, come and pick up your people

Call the ambulance, come and pick up your people
Call the ambulance, come and pick up your people
I'll put they body on the stretcher, carry they ass out
Call the ambulance

[Verse 2: Rampage]
Catch sixteen to remove your organs
H-2-O ridin round in same orbits
Notorious from New York to New Orleans
House come with the lake swimmin with dolphins
Fifty keys with large proportions
Caught a few niggas on money extortions
Niggas snitch, F.B.I. is hawkin
Call Johnny Cochran, yo this nigga is walkin
Shit, we got to close down the club
Me and my cousin Bust, we like Crockett and Tubbs
Pushin Lambo's, big chains and dubs
Lead the Flipmode security with snubs
Uppin club levels, hundred G's and up
And if them ducks rollin Bust I'm beatin it up
The streets ain't safe, yo we heatin it up
The party's on smash, now we tweakin it up
The bitches want this dick so they eatin it up

[Busta] Now all you bitches better go and..

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rampage]
Flipmode, we in heavy conjunction
We shut it down in every function
Beat you in yo' head until your brain malfunction
Yo Bust, call the label, tell 'em we in production
Pinky ring status so it's no discussion
Stop talkin shit, niggas dodgin and duckin
I'm cream cheese with the english muffin
I still got respect in the Flatbush junction, HEY

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Huh, it's like we shakin down a dude
We like a pack of dogs that come to take a nigga food
My niggas flip quicker than a fucking interlude
I beat niggas head and blood drippin through a tube
Peep bitch, I'm only here to change the fuckin mood
And freeze you niggas money like a nigga gettin sued
And leave you in the church watchin your body gettin viewed
Don't get it fucked up or even misconstrued
All you niggas better go and..

What the fuck is this?
While you pull up wit' a bunch of rentals
Sorry, but we don't give a fuck about your credentials
We back to reinstate the boom bap wit' the fundamentals
Then they act like they don't wanna move back
So when the gun's essential
Blat, hit a shot 'til they clap, so disrespectful
Calm down, the shit like this
What the fuck is wrong with your mental?
While I remind 'em who's the nicest
Sometimes these niggas' forgetful
I, so official, we makin' them actin' civil
These fickle niggas, we beat them until they're crippled
Fold their bitch-asses up and serve 'em just like a nickel crack
Then pin them down when I carve my initials in their back
Sing along with the whistle
While we constantly launching missiles
Want to debate who be nicest
Then niggas want to argue with you
What's the issue? Y'all already know the answer:
If I've been called I make them black up in this bitch
Then they kick a hole in the wall
Calm down, hahahahahaha

(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!

[Verse 2: Everlast]
Back it up, back it down, bought the four pound
Blow a hole in you dome like it was the ozone
Make you jump out your shoes, ill street blues
Pop pills, drink booze, with skills I paid dues
Hit you with the iron like Mackle boy
Spit fire when I rhyme till I smack a toy
I build, destroy, I bring pain, I bring joy
Tactics employed like Pretty Boy Floyd
Or Al Capone, international zone
Coaster my toaster in this holster home
But if it comes to the art, and it makes a spark
You're gonna find out the bite's much worse than the bark
Similar to a shark when I light up the dark
Put your body in park when I'm hitting my mark
The boys and the men all separate right there
And jump around, save PJ from the pair
Calm down

[Hook: Busta Rhymes + Sample]
Yo
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on-)
("Yo, chill, man—chill!")
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!

Turn my mic up
Turn my mic up

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Oh, my Lord! Lower the casket down (Down!)
Sprinkle the ash, or get your ass kicked, pow! (Pow!)
Frown while I shit on your crown, skip town (Town!)
Ground zero, Shapiro the king cash cow (Cow!)
Do I make 'em say "Wow!"? Strip! (Ow!)
Bow! I sit with the pound, Click, (Blow!) Blow!
Click, click, (Blow!) Click, (Blow!)
Stop traffic, dropping them classics, flip now
Bitches, I’m making them skip with thou
Art, you don’t really want start, when I growl
(Rawr, rawr, rawr!)
Let me come and mop up the knock offs
When I pop off and never stop, 'cause
When we do come through, you better lock doors (Pause!)
The wolves wanna eat, peep how they lock jaws
No need to cook up the coke, you see we cop raw
And if you ain’t had enough—
What, in the fat fishes of a phenomenal
Fahrvergnügen fuck, is going on?
Back with the B.A Baracus, callous bang, on another song
I’mma have these niggas nervous
And clipping they nails and dribbling
And witness them, nibble them, like sunflower seed shells
See these scales, got my weight up heavy, like three whales
And I shit on these males, 'til it's stinkin'
Fouler, than a weed smell, nigga, your tree fell
See how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming an email?
Talking I'm sick, I got them shook and I bang 'em at retail
Until they cripple, see I cook, like I’m slanging a weed sale
Until I triple bread, and whoop ‘em and drag 'em, like females (Sfu-ahe! Gasp!) Oh, see well, these niggas already know
The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details, the case is shut
Your bitch remind me of replacement butt
Kind of an ancient slut, it's going down
Like she was a basement fuck
Swell up this shit, like I’m sticking steaks in they gut
So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas, and attacking
Like apes in the cut, I’m waiting for the taking
While I break niggas neck, like a bracelet (fuck!)
It’s kinda like, me having a case in the truck
And drinking ‘til I’m blasted
Harassing and erase a nigga (WHAT!)
Keeping 'em open and blacking until I’m leaving ‘em stuck
And got ‘em happier, than a child in a park chasing a duck
While I’m chasing a buck
These funny niggas be chasing they luck
I be lacing them up, like boots
When I’m pushing they face in the mud—
(Ahgah!) Missiles I fling, while I spit live wire
‘Til this shit circling back around
With more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound
While I light up shit that'll cause a quick worship
And gather around, it's certain this shit'll splatter cliques
Painful and make ‘em scatter (Blink!)
Shameful, the way I shatter (Split!)
Shit apart, it doesn't matter (Rip!)
Your head up off your shoulders (With)
Bullets bigger, than a boulder
And they break ‘em and they know it's (Classic!)
And the way it’s going, you could easily get your (ass-kicked)
See, me and Shady together we’re crazy
Like baking a vomit and rabies cake, like a pastry bitch
(We that sick!) like I come from Haiti
I’m suggesting you pay me, don’t make me wanna spaz
(Al-la-la!) Like I’m a crazy Israeli (Bastards!)
While I bite the beat up, and I'm starting to heat up (Yack!)
I’m chopping your foot off
Now it’s mine, and I’m putting my feet up (Black!)
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And I’m hoping you protect your child
And I been blacking out so long
Niggas is asking if the hook had died, nah
But the beat is fried!

[Hook: Busta Rhymes + Sample]
Yo
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on-)
("Yo, chill, man—chill!")
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Apparently, there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick, so irate
With this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled? 'Cause I'm lit—narrow minded
But go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up, in Clive Davis's driveway
With his personal memoir, saying "He's bi!"
Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
Making him cry, "Rape!"—then arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade
"Yay! Yippee-Ki-Yay!", 'cause here I—
Wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
And should I take it as a sign
Maybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!)
I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave 'em the finger
To take the attention away
From my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing
The kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication, of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction, 'cause you fake imitations
Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen
Who raps nasally? Eyes hazely?
Rhymes crazily, but sounds like he may
Need some Flonase when he's speaking?
What kind of stupid question is that?
"Hey Mrs. Abraham Lincoln!
Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
How'd you think that play was this weekend?"
You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down faggot
See me on a ballot, I'm running for class clown
Rich Democrat bitch, so I'm just the candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
To have every campus, on a fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age? I am—eight!
So let's get smashed and wake up the next day
With the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids
Glass ashtray smashed
Champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
Shady for president ho, don't make me go take it back
To the days of old,with Sway & Tech radio
When I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show
Fuck you telling me, fools?
I was rippin' shop, raisin' hell up in Drew's
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down, like a sick pet
You're fucking with vets, dog, fucking internet bloggers
"I sit in front of my computer all day
And comment on everything, I'm an expert on everything, Everything sucks—play the next song!"
Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong
Son of God; I'm the S.O.G
Like a wet log, pores never get clogged
'Cause I'm so full of self-esteem, that I sweat fog
Yes, yes, y’all (Wah!)—steady on the left, y’all
Step off, 'fore you get stepped on
Soft? 'Bout as commercial as my fucking Lear jet
Jealousy’ll get you green as a Chia Pet
I can see that you’re visibly upset, dog
Alert, alert, girl—alert
Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt
So ("Jump around! Jump! Jump!")
Get that ass shaking ("Jump around! Jump!")
Came to hit you, with a fan favorite
But if you too fly for coach better get them arms
And freaking hands flailing and ("Jump!")
Like Van Halen and pray for a damn tailwind
More afraid of success, than I am of failure
So what does that tell ya?
That on a grand scale, I don’t give a fuck about nothing
Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
Before he ran straight into the damn railing

[Outro: Sample]
"Yo, chill, man—chill!"



[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Ai-ya-ya-yio...
Busta Rhymes ya gotsa be the sure shot
Flipmode ya gotsa be the sure shot
Aftermath ya gotsa be the sure shot
My live niggas y'know; who be the sure shot?
Live bitches y'know; who be the sure shot?
Shhhiiieeettt...

[Verse 1]
I'm back in ya soul just like a minister
I'm big like a movie, I'm on the screen and at the cinema
While I'm in the process of slowly gettin rid of ya
I'm bag a couple bitches, and then I throw 'em in my videa
Yeah, yeah, the God of the block
Y'know me killa had you spreadin' the spot wet and twist it like Olivia
Oh shit, flow so sicker than Chlamydia
We know you a slouch duke, we don't even consider ya
Boss nigga, see or hear me in ya area
The more niggas, the murders, the more the money, the more the merrier
Smash shit 'til everything become mass hysteria
Hungry for street shit, see I be takin care of ya check nigga
Fuck all the talk, homey I'm daring ya
The lead from the shot'll poison ya blood like malaria
Maybach Excelero exotic
Worm skin interior, my swagger to my bitch to my money
It's all superior

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
When we in the spot y'know that we sure to shine (to shine)
It's all so holy and so divine
Analyze niggas 'til we can read ya mind
Sometimes a real live nigga is hard to find
We like, "drugs overdose niggas every time"
(Cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby)
(Cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby)
We like, "drugs overdose niggas every time"
(Cocaina baby, cocaina baby)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm tired of tellin ya
Back on my bullshit, fuckin put a shell in ya
Gangster niggas respect it, salute me on the regular
When it comes to the street shit, define me as the emperor
Check it my nigga.. most of you muhfuckers amateur
I muster the nigga quick and damage any challenger
But now y'know, "Oh a nigga flow so spectacular"
Break niggas down and handle you muhfuckin characters
Captain of this shit but most of you niggas is passengers
I'm takin it back to the hood, like '87 Maximas
Yeah, yeah y'know who the truth, no need for askin the, same question again
To get the same answer bruh, fasten ya seatbelt
Bitches fuck wit the bachelor
Wit' money like a thousand coke deals from here to Panama
Strike like a brightness, a light.. I'm here to dazzle ya
Whole hood from the boroughs, to the niggas up in Attica
Soldiers in the streets, the Middle East, way down to Canada
When it comes to the block, y'know I'm the ambassador
Follow nobody's footsteps, but said it like a scavenger
Wanna talk money bitch!? Then holla at my manager
The way y'all niggas is trash, my crew'll get to blasting ya
Twelve shot clip, hollow tips, quick to plaster ya
All over the cement, spread ya like I'm mashing
Everything, Bus-a-Bus date... but check ya fuckin calendar!

[Hook]

[Outro: Marsha & Busta Rhymes]
So.. high..
Take me all the waaayyy, where you are (cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby)
I really want to beeee, take me now
Take us far awaayyy, to the skkkyyy (cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby)
I really want to beeee, so.. high



[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take more time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
That everything's gon' be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Yes, let me talk to you
See when it feels like the sun ain't shining bright enough
It's like the devil's trying to work to give an idol up
And though I'm blessed, I still got to handle the things I go through
It's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you
Someone you know that knows you and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to and vent your frustrations
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere
When you need them the most are they really ever there?
See, every thing be all good when we be having fun
The difference is really needing a friend than having one
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve them
Look at here, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell you
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value
I got a clearer view
And being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take my time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
That everything's gon' be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'
Even though we probably link up every now and then
With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend
Something I realize is that I don't even have to mention
Is whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question
Sometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me
And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately
See you was here, when it started to haywire
You're still here, walking with me going through the fire
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too
On everything that I believe and I appreciate you
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearing me out
But I thank you for just being there and for hearing me out
I got a clearer view
I thank God that you've been there for me, I'm here for you

[Hook: John Legend]
I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm gon' to take my time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
Everything's gon' be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed
I made a decision

[Verse 3: Common]
I look in your eye and I see the pain in it
Life's a game, maybe the game did it
I know I changed, they say the fame did it
Life has changed, maybe the game did it
Two friends, now in two different places
And the mister catching planes, and you catching cases
Friendship, we never based it on position
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I would come to town and never get up, with you
Around then, things weren't so simple
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through
Outside chatter, messing with our mental
On the chase of funds, trust, you can't forget to
It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to
No matter how far, just know that I'm with you

[John Legend & Jamie Foxx]
I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take my time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
That everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed
I made a decision...



[Intro: Akon (T.I.)]
When they tell you that you'll never get over (ha ha ha)
Just tell 'em they're number one (el capitan partner)
You're a champion (yeah, the Ali of my day, you know me)
Don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over!
(I can't hear ya, I'm way up here, what you say?)
Just tell 'em they're number one (it's over for who, numero uno partner)
You're a champion (ha ha ha, let's go Bust!)

[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
Now, there's, nothing you can do to stop a nigga from within
With the hunger of a lion I secure another win (hey!)
So passionate, you might even misinterpret it as arrogant
I'm going in (hey!)
I'mma make the world feel my pain
While I'm showing you my muscle and I hustle through the game
And even though they leave us in the hood like we ain't SHIT
We ain't got nothing but everything to gain
Look, even if a motherfucker try to pop me
I'm so blessed - do anything that you could do to stop me (Stop me)
Now I'm climbing up the ladder and I'm jumping at the top
You might wanna call me - Rocky
See there's more of us - Ugly
You don't really wanna war with us - Trust me
So glorious, that we from the bottom
Still we victorious - Hug me

[Hook: Akon (Busta Rhymes)]
I see it in your eyes, it ain't hard to tell
They're watching you (can't nobody ever stop what I'm doing)
They just telling you lies, they want you to fail
They're plotting on you (and they can never stop my movement!)
So, don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over
(You know exactly what to tell 'em!)
Just tell 'em they're number one (number one)
You're a champion!

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hey, see the websites lying trying to block my shine
Don't you know you never will stop my grind?
In a drop-top flying like I don't got time
Got everybody surprised that I won't drop dimes
What's on yo' mind? Best get me off it
At least quit lying if you must keep talking
Go on with the nonsense, best keep walking
Boy how you sue us, send the lawyers to the office
A lot of y'all got sprung like that shorty
Couple months off, I'll be right back shorty
With a brand new swag and a brand new .40
And a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it
Nation-wide news, nigga yeah you saw it
Shorty need a bodyguard for his bodyguard, don't he?
Tip falling off sound kinda odd, don't it?
Y'all hate to see me ball? Take it up with God homie

[Hook: Akon]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Any situation where you might get fed up
Gotta stay focused, homie keep your head up
It don't really matter what the next one is doing
Homie gotta handle your business and then you better step up
Live to the fullest for the dream you're pursuing
Ain't nothing in the work gon' really stop what you're doing (Oh!)
Go hard no matter what they be saying
Nigga don't quit cause you know we gotta keep it moving (Oh!)
Take a look and see yourself in me
Cause it's all about we (We)
Me and you securing a win together
So we could be the best that we could ever be (Oh!)
Stay up on your grind, be the first one to - Set it
People try to shut me down, I won't - Let it
I'm so stubborn for the success
You know my motto, don't stop, get it, get it!

[Hook: Akon]

[Akon]
Tell 'em they're number one [repeat to fade]



[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Doctor, yeah
I think we got some shit for 'em (FLIP-MODE!)
Yeah I'mma rub these sticks together
Check it, and start a bonfire

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
And if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our
Flipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us
Y'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Now I'm subtle, once I pick up my metal
Put my foot on the pedal, ridin' through every ghetto
Analyze the shit I'm seein' when I sip Amaretto
A lot of bitches on the strip, struttin' in they stilettos
Then they wave and say hello, when my Lambo' is yellow
Everything they got a jingle when they walk like ah-Jello
See the niggas on the corner and I never forget it
And I never regret it because I see how you get it
Now because of you niggas, I'm a hustler nigga
'Gnac guzzler nigga, rip your jugular nigga
In the night I become the type to love when it's dark
Cause when I pull up and park, is when I'm makin my mark
See the fact's that I'm tryin' to strive and capitalize in
Start to max-a-mimize and b-build a ent-ter-prise
And wh-while I'm stockin' this bread, keep ah-stockin' the lead
And leave a permanent dot, on the top of your head

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
And if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our
Flipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us
Y'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away

[Verse 2: Nas]
Ill Will, Flip-mooode!
I'm the Enigma, there is none harder, smarter
Martyr, Godfather, my entrance, your departure
Pardon Dre this beat is a monster, catchy
Like sleepin under open windows that's drafty
Then wakin' up my throat scratchy, that's how I spit it nasty
They short, a few inches North of a dwarf
My flow's Murciélago, ghostin' them narcos
Toastin' the ways of the original Pablos
Still a pyramid architect, mix liquors like a chemist
Killer lyricist, poetical tyrant
Sneaker store terrorist, Mt. Everest I climbed it
Heat is drawn, no creepin on me whenever I'm bent
My mind spray, my nine spray
And freak styles like 3000 Andre
To keep pilin, keep pushin them drops
Nas, runnin with hot Busta Bust, we don't stop

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
And if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our
Flipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us
Y'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Now I'm hot, and we runnin the block
Watch me run in your spot, fiends comin in flocks
Add a little cut to the coke when I'm cookin the pot
DRUGS, BITCH! I got what you want come and get what I got
Now I almost forgot, I come to close up your shop
I love to fold up a knot, love totin the Glock
Helps me feel safer when niggas try to scheme on my plot
Try to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot
See I will leave you to rot, only defendin my stock
Niggas know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not
Lose your life in the drop, while I harvest the crop
My hot shit; bust a cannon have you run in your socks
See we live on the edge, bang shit with a sledgehammer
Split up your head, kill a snitch for the feds
Let's go, for the streets I'm always spittin a gospel
Get Nas holdin a barrel size of elephant nostril

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
And if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our
Flipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us
Y'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away



[Busta Rhymes]
Let's get it goin

(Verse 1)
We bite the nigga straight outta jail, give me the money nigga
I'll smack you stupid, ain't nuttin funny nigga
I'll lay a nigga out and use they ass to shoot like a marble black floor
Bloody something like a hacksaw
And then we stash a couple gats in the bag because we at war
Pistol whip some of these niggas, leavin em wit cracked jaws
Battlin like we in costalon, niggas see you supposed to know
We extremely serious niggas
You see it's so marvelous how we just strap more, pack more
No chichi niggas allowed, just throw em out the back door
This lone menace got it wicked for the protenants
You niggas soft like limp dick and lead progenes
Blessin the younger thug wit shit to look forward to
The god is back, so niggas is quick and to fast forward you
Yo, this shit be straight energy
You've been fuckin wit Flip Mode, nigga, while I'm refreshin your memory

Everybody rise, everybody rise, everybody riiiiiiiiise

(Verse 2)
You see it's hectic, respect it
Blow up your deck until my cassette is ejected
How I will beat you just like your father, don't even bother
However nigga, whatever nigga, who wanna follow?
It gets coarse like the calice of a struggling black foot under privilege
I'm quick to stick you for your whole bank book
Bitches follow my bounce and follow my flow
Follow me now, follow me later, follow my glow
Ayyo, follow instructions and follow the pro
And to follow my magic, bitches wanna follow my doe
Keepin ya bouncing, got all my people singin the hook
Got bitches buggin like how niggas be wild in the brook
Look, we street niggas, while you live by the book
Funny nigga, ain't no need to shoot yourself in the foot
Fuck wit bitches that's gettin doe and they know how to cook
In every struggle, I always did whatever it took!
So all my niggas

Yeah! Our shit be always right
Every move you'll see how it's related

[Busta]
Genesis, Genesis, Genesis

[Hook]

[Busta]
Genesis, Genesis, Genesis

(Verse 1)
While we continuously stay sculpturin bombs
Love unconditional greetings with opening arms
And for my worthy niggas I'mma die tryin for y'all
With the blessing of an angel's tear cryin' for y'all
Back to the foundation, takin you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginnin and a brand new hunger
Starvin to where my skin was suffocatin my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decoratin my crib
Touch the love I got like you holdin my heart in my hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal
Never thought y'all meet a nigga that could be this real
Flipmode up in this bitch now let me make you aware
Too late for turnin back my nigga cause we takin it there

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Genesis, Genesis, Genesis
And leave!

(Verse 2)
And leave a mark until it's deep in the floor
Y'all niggas fucked up never should've let let me get my feet in the door
And then I step through, FUCK wipin my feet at the door
I be the deacon I'm beatin niggas and speakin the raw
Strictly raw shit is what niggas be seekin me for
Testin my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step.. for sure
Rep and make you wanna accept more
Niggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like somethin that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doin it, these mu'fuckas probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feelin of people like the comin of Jesus
While a lot of other niggas don't be tellin you nothin
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearin smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggas like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!
A whole new thang startin for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggas trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggas from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggas to my live niggas everywhere
Too late for turning back, we takin it there

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Busta Rhymes]
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Flip it, tip it, dip it, pimpin' (Yeah)
Get it, get it, get it, get it

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Dressed, ready to impress, fresh up in my Louis suit
Step up in the cub, bitches line up ready to salute
Let me squeeze your juicy fruit, Mamis call me Huey Newton
Dapper like a cracker that's an act to gettin' movie loot
Get on your mark and get set, ready, go
Funny, but these niggas already know
That we're knocking on microphones
Just hadn't already shitted on niggas, miraculous flow
Got niggas tryna reappear while the damage is low
That's an emphatical "No"
Slap him up, clap him up, bundle these niggas like packages
Wrap 'em in bandages slow
See a lot of bitches in they Humvee 4
Coward niggas comin' in and we be flingin' the door
Pause for a minute, then I peel a little slow
Black, then I throw the West up at every hoe
Why y'all other niggas money slow?
Peep game, 'cause my money come retarded though
This shit here be the anthem for all of my bitches
And every one of my gangsters, yo, gangsters, yo

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Missy Elliott]
Get it, get it, get it, get it

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
Pop to the pop drop, like a drop top
Errbody lookin' when I step up in the spot
See the way I rock? I'm hot, you not
Errbody wanna clock, man, get off my jock
Errbody know Misdemeanor don't stop
And my records don't flop, got the game on lock
Not tick tock, six carats in my watch
Now, kiss my ass, haters, keep watch
Get it, get it, money, money, I get it (Get it)
Hundred grand in the club, I'll spend it (Spend it)
You lose, you lose, and I'm winnin'
Y'all ain't doing nothing new, I been did it
Don't come at all or ya better come with it
Money in my bank be seven digits
See me buy bottles with no cash limit
Flow be tighter than skinny jeans fitted
There is no competition, I are the one, no competition
Lick a gyal, no competition
When mi come through, tell the fool "Better run"
Wanna battle me? Well, you a dum-dum
Not Kelly, but I give her motivation
My style you not takin', I'm Missy E, money makin'

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Busta Rhymes]
Get it, get it, get it, get it

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Y'all niggas already know what it is
Y'all niggas already know what I do
Every time we step up in the spot
Homie, I'ma take yo shine from you
Homie, you ain't got the slightest clue
Diamonds'll shine with the brightest blue
Niggas had to throw that money how we throw it
Funny, but they money on a diet, too
I ain't even knew him, why they try it, boo
'Cause I throw brass if a nigga tired
Broke nigga leave until they gone, gone, gone
Homie get a little inspired, too
Preach shit 'til another amp is smokin'
Spend til' I'm lookin' like a martian, floatin'
That motherfucker's lookin' at me all weird
Funny nigga, you ain't seen that God has spoken?
It's like they turnt the lights on, see the way we shine, bitch?
You spend 'til your bread gone, we spend like it's a crime, bitch
Homie, now throw that bread like you don't give a fuck
Shawty, go 'head, bend over, pick that money up

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Busta Rhymes]
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Flip it, tip it, dip it, pimpin' (Yeah)
Get it, get it, get it, get it

Money, cars, clothes, sexy broads, plenty more, go.. get you some

[Busta Rhymes]
I'm sayin who told y'all to let a muhfucker back on the block
With the bullshit, see y'all done fucked up now!
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now!
You gotta problem son? Imagine how the club sound
Look and see I'm ready to spark it
Soon as I zoom on my target, muhfucker better roll out the carpet
See the way I comin through, and how I kick in the door
Watch how I coffee grind like never before.. the way I wreck from the door
So immaculate, passionate, when I'm speakin
I'm preachin, all my niggas out in EVERY HOOD!
You tryin to compete? You better be INCREDIBLY GOOD!
Niggas you want heat? I figured you would!
That's I waste no time to give it to you niggas (this time)
And give you all the jewels in (this rhyme), and then I put it down to you all!
I can't get enough of it niggas, I gotta ex-plore (many)
All of my options, I gotta get me plenty more...

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
A lot of niggas shit sound dated
I'm like Shaq, franchise player just got traded
To the number one team in the league
See I ain't on J Records, I'm on DRE Records, Aftermath BITCH!
You need to learn cause you ain't knowin the half, BITCH!
And while I'm gone I'm puttin dough in the stash, BITCH!
So new and fresh I say it again
So what it do, don't test see I'mma blaze to the end
I'm comin through, so confess you niggas know who the kid
I'm like a newborn nigga, that's securing a win
(HOT!) So new and so current and they hate this
The streets'll classify me in another level of greatness
I'm here to fix up the game, I'm givin it a facelift
New and improved, watch the way I make the game shift!
Now watch me swing it out the ballpark
I come to shut it down, don't let the war start while I come to get the...

They say we make the greatest HITS
So who am I, to dis-AGREE?
I hear the streets callin, y'all was lookin for ME
Everybody, was lookin for one thing
You lookin for something, well I got the something
Now every single person that was lookin for something
Well let me give 'em what they askin fo' - HEY!
Let me give 'em what they askin fo' - HEY, HEY!

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey - what'chu tryin to know?
I got the sick Southside and it ain't no joke
Hot cookin, sittin pretty, shiny smokes
Up in the fine cuisine, sup a little wine with my folks
A bunch of filthy rich niggas that be grindin the most
Bunch of ace of spade models makin champagne toasts
And I got, Armani suits, sick wrists on glow
A nigga back, hittin harder than a 2x4
See them diamonds, yeah I bet'cha never seen 'em befo'
Drippin off a nigga 'til the stones'll fall on the flo'
I'm throwin, money down the room to please myself
I'm into self-preservation so I freeze myself
See I'm so, dipped fresh I wanna squeeze myself
And do it so big sometimes I can't believe myself
No matter how hard a nigga greed my wealth
See you can front if you want, the game need my help
Now let's GO~!

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey - how you ain't gon' choke
When you see five mills hangin off my throat?
We don't know about the drugs, but you know mines coke
Couple Venezuelan bitches chillin on my boat
Now now now, a lot of niggas ridin on my coat
But I don't worry cause you know the difference is mines dope
E'rytime the hood's eatin nigga they find hope
Ain't nuttin change same birdie hangin off my rope
Now listen - I got the 50 if you all want smoke
Just put your lips up to your fingers if you takin a toke
You see I gladly share the weed just never leave me the roach
When I get with bitches in the building they be catchin the ghost
I'm sayin, go 'head and roam girl and giggle around me
Break your shit, the shit it start to wiggle around me
So, swaggnificent the shit won't stop
Just got the crib fit with airplane lights on top
Now let's GO~!

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey - how you all gon' sleep
When a nigga like the groove but beepin on my creep
So serious, when you walk up on my street
The Violator hood niggas busy parkin my fleet
Of vehicles from East Europe I can hardly repeat
The names of, shit is strange but it's hard to defeat
How we do it and we kill 'em 'til there ain't nuttin left
I finish niggas e'rytime because we do it to death
Now let's GO~!

[Hook]

{*repeat "HEY" to fade*}



[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Old dro bottles, and blow, blowin' from both zones
Layin' in them Tahoes we own the projo's
Three for tenement we in the lobby with the big
(da dun dun dun) Don't move cause I'm a representative
Live for the street, ask, you die in the war
'member that -- blast that three atcha -- hide in the wall
We gangsta, republicans with them big things, big rings
Get your head shot off, daddy you don't believe chains
Loose cameras, big hammers, Station Wagon, blue Phantoms
Smokin' the block up, y'all witness the zoo gamblers
We ain't takin' no shorts, its just the early 80's
That made me, now I sit paid and then maybe
Nothing but my Lords and raps, these bags of dope
Under the mattress and I clack like a slave key
Wash your squad up, I roll double refuse to rock
Closed up my door up and murked you on the job (aww)

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Gettin' money like back in the days
Niggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games
Slayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up
In unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas
Streched that coke and see it come back triple
When we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine
Strategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans
And George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
We got guns tucked in our waistlines with rags hangin' from our back pockets
Miraculous money, nigga, can't stop it
Sherlock Holme' Kangols
Medallions so big, attach strings you could turn 'em into banjos
Phenomenal profiting, drug money
Scram rapper, my 100EX golden like a honey graham cracker
Sidewinda, niggas tryna' infiltrate, blind-side a nigga
Hit you with the 8, we in the club
Dumbin' out, drunk in fronta the airbrush
Backdrop, ones out, fi'-dollas for picture with the guns out
Juggle for a couple days, close shop
Then continue to bubble until the strip hotter than a microwave
Don't stop, travel on my spare time
And keep niggas wit us to push our shit like George Jefferson hairline
No frill, niggas better go chill
'Fore this gun go up in your nose like coke sniffin' up your nose-stril

[Hook]
Gettin' money like back in the days
Niggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games
Slayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up
In unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas
Streched that coke and see it come back triple
When we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine
Strategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans
And George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Ay yo, saluteme kid, coop me in the red room booth
And eatin' Fruit Loops it's all for the loot boo
Designated hammer that'll lay ya up scrambling
Blant ninjas get 'em more popped up, and start blowin' niggas magnums up
Caught me in the mix wit some rich soldiers, that reaction
Is a key action, black sent forty doja's up
We huddle in big plans, my big mans and them
Slick as the shit breaks from outtas you, rip dip, then quakes them

[Busta Rhymes]
See I was always good at science, in the class I was dope
Ask 'em for the chemistry temperature now I'm cookin' the coke up
Used to sit and watch them older niggas for hours
And did acknowledge to how cold water quickly harden the powder
Took your turn into somethin big to acredit (uhh)
But ya needs connect shit up from South America
Money calculations, told B.I.G. I sit up on it still
Holdin old hundred dollar bills, wit small faces

[Hook]
Gettin' money like back in the days
Niggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games
Slayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up
In unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas
Streched that coke and see it come back triple
When we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine
Strategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans
And George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine



Here we go now, yea
C'mon, yea, check it

[Verse One]
I said my solo jump off been boomin since nine-six
My solo jump off been boomin since nine-six
Hittin trippin the circuit breaker, flickin the light switch
The kid like is he known for givin you wild hits
I keep my name on the way on top of the now list
Bangin on every level, droppin the now shit
It's like the feelin after watchin a couple of (?) flick
And once you hear the kid, you'll be knowin the sound sick
Spaz in the club, watchin the crowd flip
That's when I knew the crown was up for whoever the crown fit
Nowadays while I go bag me a fine bitch
Bitch watchin my pocket, seein we wild rich
Shorty hopin we smellin nothin like foul fish
While you swingin ass at the devil, claimin you righteous
A lot of haters I'm knowin you like this
While you floss unnecessarily, sippin on wild Crist'

[Hook]
I say LADIES, my MERCEDES
Hold fo' in the back, two if you fat
Feel it all in your gut, your neck and your back
When you step up in the club I know you know how to act
Hey SOLDIERS, get your floss on
Va-let in the lot, park the Yukon
Shorty shakin her waist, and rippin her thong
Now all my people are muggin and singin the song, I'm sayin

[Verse Two]
Shit still boomin in two-thousand and three
My shit still boomin in two-thousand and three
And we don't give a fuck about who you claimin to be
My jewels blind bitches where they ain't able to see
These fools try to talk just a little much to a G
They say the wrong shit, they head just might end upside of a tree
Clear my thoughts just a little, pass me a cup of tea
Takin different constant boats, from the land to the sea
I got my paper see, I ain't doin nuttin for free
Unless it's for the hood, it might cost you a small fee
Niggas all in the street, whylin whippin the V
Clever from New York to Chicago back to the D
Check it, take it back like when I was flippin a ki
Bonin chicks, holdin titties like they was Pamela Lee
You know I mastered the art and got it down to a tee
And keep it goin add enough spice, we holdin the recipe
Big paper we makin, all of my crew agree
Stack more and bust up a bottle of Hennessy
In case you niggas ain't even knowin my pedigree
Invested in resorts for the niggas who go and ski
If you ain't know the streets is belongin to me
I get my people from the hood and then take 'em all on a spree shoppin
While you niggas is busy coppin the pleas
We busy blowin frontin like you ain't knowin my stee'

[Hook]

Yea, snap yo' fingers, c'mon
{*heavy breathing*}
Here we go now, yea
C'mon



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
This shit sound like... One, two o'clock in the mornin' with the full moon out
Niggas in they trucks, creepin'
With a fresh box of ecstasy pills for these bitches

[Verse 1]
Yeah, team select, please collect, Gs connect
Thieves, nigga, direct the trees to the SmokeFest
Wanna take a toke? (Yes!)
The newest zone I'm in
I'm like Smithsonian, nigga, fuck it, call me Napoleon
Wave the torch, cut the head off the Leviathan
The terminology I'm rhymin' in cause a frenzy up in Ireland
Hit ya, I'm gon' get ya
And drop the bomb scripture at your barmitzvah
Yo, map shit out, blast through the speakers
With a wifebeater on, Bushe below, a new pair of sneakers
Street niggas hang on the sidewalk
That's where I learned my fly talk, pimp strut, and how to skywalk
Moderatin' how we establish the whole Conglomerate
The way we honor it, you'll never conquer it
See how we wreck has a global effect on even Polish people
Young and restless down to the old and feeble
Peep them, Czechoslovakian to Yugoslavian niggas
Be all into my bounce so don't be botherin', niggas
So NOW you should feel the whole cathedralish bounce
Put one in your stomach leave you in a fetalish crouch, nigga
My vernacular is spectacular
Strategic plans'll have you lookin wacker than a postal office massacre
Is that so? Make moves just like a fatso
Bounce in a minivan Astro after my gat (Blow!)

[Hook]
Ayo, get up, get out, get dough
(Ha, get dough, nigga)
Roll up, light up, and smoke that 'dro
(Smoke 'dro now)
Bitch, shake yo' hips and bounce real slow
Niggas, rep yo' hood, I'm with that
All my niggas
(All my niggas)
If you with me
(If you with me)
Yeah, I see you
(Yeah)
Holla
(Throw yo' guns in the motherfuckin air, c'mon!)
All my bitches, if you're with me
(Yeah, all my bitches where you at now)
Yeah, I see you
(You know I see y'all)
Holla
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
My whole entire mind state deeper—
Than astronomy and mathematics like Galileo
Smash you niggas like mashed potato
Back when niggas used to rock Ballys and Clarks
I used to watch, little niggas shouldn't hustle nickel crack in the park
Barrels spray the brighter flame in the dark
Blood-spill stain on the street, that's how niggas be leavin' they mark
Fuckin' with diplomats who love Bailey's
Monopolize and quickly get other money fuckin' with Israelis
So solid how we be symbolic
To a handful of niggas that be all schemin' on the same wallet
Them type niggas that be conspirin' and kidnappin'
Shit happens! Gun clap for you in the gift wrappin'
You should follow how the style switch up
Like a group of religious niggas schemin' to kill they archbishop
You big, pussy nigga, actin' all hard
Call me atheist, because I don't believe in you, God
It's like a grand feast, celebratin' the bounce of the century
I tote the recipe quick for any type of discrepancy
Busta Rhymes, the great renaissance artist and architect
Like how a Filippo Brunelleschi portrait is so hard to get
We got the obscure shit for the street
Nevertheless, we split your head and your chest, now rock to the beat
Yo, we got the obscure shit for the street
Nevertheless, we split your head and your chest, now rock to the beat

[Hook]
Ayo, get up, get out, get dough
(Ha)
Roll up, light up, and smoke that 'dro
(Get dough, smoke 'dro, muh'fuckers!)
Bitch, shake yo' hips and bounce real slow
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
Niggas, rep yo' hood, I'm with that
All my niggas
(Yeah, all my niggas)
If you with me
(If you with me, c'mon!)
Yeah, I see you
(Yeah, know I see y'all)
Holla
(Throw yo' motherfuckin' guns in the sky, c'mon!)
All my bitches, if you're with me
(All my bitches where you at, yaknow I see y'all)
Yeah, I see you
(Yeah! Yeah!)
Holla
(Holla at me, now, c'mon!)

[Outro]
Yeah
Busta Rhymes, cookin' up a little brown stew 'n' chicken
Dr. Dre, niggas
Yeah

[Skit: Wife-in-law]
Yeah, I understand that you're not happy, but that's your wife, and I'm your mistress, so you gotta go back home. But before you do, let me swallow you. Let me lick you in all the right places. I want you to cum all over me, and when you do, I'll bathe you. And then we'll get out the tub, and we'll fuck, and I'll lick your ass, and I'll braid your hair, and you can fuck me anyway you please. We can do almost anything, but once we're finished, and you're happy here, you have to go back home to your wife. But don't you ever forget that I'm your wife in law...

Capitalizing off on the music that be we be keepin coming
Have you niggas really spazing and blackend out in their stomach (Hey bebe)
There's no mistakin you know we makin you bounce
Takin the unforsaken approach the way we be takin out
Scrapin these niggas and breakin their pockets to chase them out
Suddenly call your bitches to see just how they just makin out
Fuck it, we kick the bucket and to continue to stake them out (Ha)
And in back of the crib is where we will be makin out
Puting some shit together make it so you could all attend
Welcoming you and my nigga so we can break your pocket again (Oh Oh)
Niggas flossin and tossin their drinks like they all in the place
And leave the niggas the (?) until they catch one all up in their face (Huh)
Y'all know we'll spray y'all niggas and know we gonna wet ya
And rep for my niggas cause we comin to get ya
I said...

[Busta Rhymes]
See how I'm drillin 'em baby?
It's Bus-a-Bus back bitch, I'm killin 'em crazy
We off the Relaxic, I'm spillin the gravy
Got every club packed thick, creating a frenzy
To be the latest greatest for all you niggas from gazing
Bugatti off white tan, interior pastry
See my swagger sharp like that, these niggas amaze me
As a matter a fact just salute me and praise me
Enough of that

[Missy Elliott]
We be up in the club, niggas sportin them minks
Tipsy in the club, nigga buyin 'em drinks
Walk around lookin like our shit don't stink
Ice by my neck so bright, watch 'em blink

[Busta Rhymes]
Okay, now I got me a clear view
I like it when you get up and I'm lovin ya hairdo
The way you cross ya legs, ass spread in the chair you
The way ya clothes skimpy, so it's easy to tear through
Appreciate my presence, while I shine wit' a barrel
I came up wit' cut diamonds, obscure in a rare blue
Shorty ain't checkin for you, step to the way I do
Super senile, I ain't the one to compare to
Now she was sayin...

[Hook Two: Missy Elliott]
See the ass? Touch me right there
Wanna touch my nookie baby? Touch me right there
Is that Dr. Dre baby? Touch me right there

[Busta Rhymes]
Bounce back, brand new on the scene what?
Took a little minute, I'm back with the re-up
Switched it up a little bit, back with a clean cut
Shorty's lost her head, see all the koochies I cream up
I love the way she in all over the girls when I'm teaming up
It's gettin hotter in this bitch, windows are steaming up
Amazed by the pinky, neck, and wrist be gleaming up
How I dominate the scene, how a nigga be cleaning up
I see you liking everything, you see me and you
You frowning on your girl, like you ain't willing to share boo
The hotel ain't far, meet me there and if you
Ya girl looking like she wit' it, she can come/cum get it too
You get impatient Ma, show you just how the kid move
I'm bangin in the truck, and let her watch in the rearview
See we don't really care about the niggas who came through
Over there cause over here, see I'mma show ya how we do
So check it baby...

[Hook One]

[Outro: Busta Rhymes + Missy]
See it don't matter what ya doin over there
See we gets it poppin, that's how we do it over here
That's if we toss bottles, that's how we do it over here
Check it, floss models, that's how we do it over here
Listen, rare throttles, that's how we do it over here
Check it, ice collars, that's how we do it over here nigga
See it don't matter what ya doin over there
See we gets it poppin, that's how we do it over here (over here)



[Intro: Busta]
It's too late to turn back now nigga
Getcha money getcha money (two times)
Hey I'm bout to act up in a wondertrip on their ass

[Hook: T-Pain]
You should already know when I walk in the door
That it ain't no use in frontin' on me

And if you feel me put your hands up
And come and sing the hustler's anthem with me
Lalalala Yeah Lalalala Keep hustlin dog Keep hustlin dog

[Busta Rhymes]
What it do, what it do all day
Come through and get it jumpin'
Throwin' money away
It don't matter if you're hustlin' a bundle of yay
Or you got a 9 to 5
Let the champagne spray
Boom click a little don of the red rose
Two chicks on my arm when I step okay
Gillette razor sharp
You know the boy don't play
BC ten drop me in Sandro pey
Let the money machine roll on
We been needin' a nigga like you in the street so long
Everytime you drops yakkin'

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Kiddie bangin' at random

Tryin' to hustle
Cop a plane

You hustle up on the block
Some niggas hustle at random

As long as you can go and muscle a grip
Whether you shinin' from a grind
Or you hustle legit
Either way get money nigga
Turn on the switches

[Verse 1: Spliff Star]
We been together for a few years, shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road, hardly ever home
Always busy this busy that can't talk on the phone
I know you aggrevated, walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short, how longer can you tolerate it
Listen ma I'm just motivated, I do this for us
Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now

[Verse 2: Baby Sham]
Hey yo to really be honest
You stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express the words
How much the kid loves ya
I'mma stand as a man never above ya
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you
And that ill shit about it
We gon' sex every day
But when we sex we tease
In a passionate way

Those little elaborate ways
Got the god feelin' released
To relax for the day

Of stress on ya head

And always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me

[Verse 4: Rah Digga]
We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from looseys and buses to fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back (oh yeah)
Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats (boy)
We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older

[Hook: Busta Rhymes, Mariah Carey]
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you (give it to me)
I know what you want
You know I got it

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yes you know I'll die for you
And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you

[Verser 6: Mariah Carey]
I will climb a mountain high aha
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me
This is where your love is supposed to be

[Verse 7 : Rampage]
I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me
Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats ya ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world you never leave me
Fall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things ya do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter you'll never do me greasy

[Hook: Busta Rhymes, Mariah Carey]
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you

You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me

Cause that's my chick.. and she the shit

[Hook One] + [Hook Two]

And if I have to skip town, she hold a stash for a nigga

But you know I love the way my bitch be holdin it down

[Hook One] + [Hook Two]



We're live in five, four, three, two, one!

Welcome everybody, you are "live in the den"
With big tigger hangin' out today with one of my friends

Whattup, okay if you ain't know it be one of the best of all time
Busta bust for short, for some better know me bust' rhymes
(what's good?) maintainin' (same here, just smashin')
(how the fam?) they all good my nigga, thanks for askin'
You and yours?

We all blessed, things ain't too bad
Still dealin' with last year's sudden loss of my dad
(man, my condolences) thanks dawg, let's begin
Ain't seen you in a sec, busta what you been up to since then?

Stayin' healthy and keepin' it movin' while I just be showin'
These other niggas how to do it while I'm constantly growin'
I've been learnin' a lot, and still earnin' a lot of money crazy
Doin' my thing and securin' a win for all my babies

Aight, well it's clear in this new year you've been busy
But how you been dealin' with the drama of the loss of your man izzy?

It's been one of the most traumatic times and I'll never forget it
I'm survivin', thus bein' a punchin' bag for those affected
It's somethin' that I accepted, it was hard to understand
The way things happen, but in the end I guess it's god's plan

Word, heard you beefin' with five-oh, couple cases on rotation
And on top of that, bust' rhymes is now on probation?

Yeah, and I thank judge stevens and we was happy to see
That he ain't send me up north cause I got a family to feed

Changed your image up last year, cut the dreads down low
And also, gave the appearance of some major muscles
Now on the low streets been talkin' like it usually do
Busta bust, help us out, the public needs to know

Just for the record the reason a nigga cut off the dread
I had to shed, tired of carryin' weight on my head
Secondly, it's all good when niggas talk, well they need to back it up
Only needles I use is when I tat-tat-tat it up

Uhh, some people sayin' you changed, even your flipmode fam (uh-huh)
I heard the word's came safe from rah digga and baby sham (right)
Said you (passed the courvoisier) to pick up a gun
Said you more concerned about bein' hard than havin' fun

Yo, wow tig', I see you takin' it there; you got your arsenal, huh?
I think I know where you got that from, that vibe article bruh
The press'll turn your family against each other for 'fetti, to sell a book
Besides we all talked already and we good

Wowwww, that's what's up, be clear it's goin down
And if you wanna holla at bust call us up right now
Phone lines is open, what y'all, wanna discuss?
What's good caller, you "live in the den" with big tig' and bust
(hey tig'!) what's good ma? (enjoyin' the show)
(but there's somethin' about busta I've been dyin' to know)
Well holla at him

Hey busta (what's good ma?)
I've been a fan since way back when you dropped "woo-hah"
(woo-hah!!) yeah, that was my joint
Every album since then always been on point
(thank you) videos and big shows is hardcore
So why you think your albums haven't sold more?

Well baby, the nature of the business is unstable
Especially when your project ain't properly promoted by your label
E'ry album I put out gold or platinum, just a second
Check the hardware on my walls is major, just for the record

Read about you in a book or two
Now tell me bust, please discuss, were they all lies or some of it true?

Well I read about you in a couple of books too son
But I don't even know, tell me which book you readin' from

Aight, next caller

Hey busta, heard about you on miss jones
(why you bringin' up old shit? you need to leave that alone)
So I'm sayin', is it true what she said?
Did you jump right out from between her legs and start fryin' eggs?

I can't remember exactly but I used to ride to her hood
And pick her up all hours a night, thought the pussy was good
'bout fifteen years ago, shit
I can't imagine she'd remember that a nigga made a mean egg sandwich

I seen a couple websites try to put you on blast (uh-huh)
With your relationship with homegirl with the real fat ass

Who? you talkin' 'bout deelishis? yeah her body is vicious
She like trouble; thus we only friends, y'all made us a couple

How do you deal with the gossip, rumors and lies
And feelin' like each and every move you make is analyzed?

Yo, it's all good, you see the blessing is a gift and a curse
To be in a position I am, shit could be worse

I know my time's runnin' short so let me get to this thought
I'm sure you wanna thank your fans for all of their support

Absolutely, see y'all are why I shine like the sun
Big up to all my peeps who been ridin' with me since day one
It's why I walk the streets with pride, you niggas know how I shit it
It's why I rep it thorough for all the fans who stay committed

Busta, now you've been gettin' it in since way back when
So what you say to critics sayin' you can't do it again?

See I ain't gotta say shit to 'em, I'm off to somethin' else
Nigga check my rã©sumã©, bitch it speak for itself
It's why I always do what I do, and I big up my chest
God put his hands on me, you could see that I'm blessed
And I'm grateful

Aight! it's time to go
But I thank y'all for tunin' on in to the "live in the den" show

And if you don't know, now you know
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Holla busta [both men ad libbing]
(yes, yes, yes) [ad libbing]
(yes, yes, yes) [laughing]
That's what's up man, holla (ha ha ha, you crazy nigga)



[LaToiya Williams] + (Busta)
I-iiii-iiiih, I never thought
Thaaaaaaat I, could fiiiind (excuse me miss)
Someone, so special (can I have a word wit'chu baby)

[Busta Rhymes]
Miss can I get a second to speak and quietly mention
That I am so into who you are, can I get your attention
My observations of you creates conversations for you
And if you got a little time, I got the patience for you
Okay? Good, you givin me the time to talk?
While I figure it out and sort what I'm tryin to say, let's walk
Just tryin to keep it gutter, respectfully I won't stutter
Don't you agree, we look better when we walk with each other?
I've seen you many times, yes I've encountered many dimes
I'm feelin somethin special with us, it's just one of the many signs
I think that we have to look forward to our go-through
Any war with you regardless what it is I'm tryin to score with you
Sometimes I think and wonder especially through rain and thunder
If I'd ever find the one to ride when I'm on top or under
Until we reach the end, ma with love as I be your friend
Oh; here you can take my number, I hope we can speak again

[Hook One: LaToiya Williams]
No matter how mister, you know that I'll die wit'cha
Until the end of life, lay down on the ground wit'cha
I'll give my life to you; I hope it all comes true
Ready to start for you, I give all my heart to you
And when together I hope we never fall apart sugar
Now that it feels so good; our thoughts are understood

[Busta Rhymes]
I'd like to learn from ya, but I'm 'bout to turn from ya
It's been about a week and I ain't even heard from ya
Is it somethin at all or did I just bump in and fall
And even though you did I see how you was reluctant to call
But it's nothin to crawl before we walk (OOH) listen
And it's nothin to stall before we talk - look
To tell the truth I'm happy I found you and that I can be around you
And thus I'm diggin you, I ain't just tryin to pound you
I'm only tryin to crown you and wife you and wedding gown you
Regardless what I'm with, shorty seem like she always down to
Just spend a little time and then CLICK, you know that kind of chemistry
The recipe to then SIP, and a little bit of wine
Mami, I like your conduct, light the fireworks and bombs up
The type of chick I wanna talk about when I call my moms up
Until the love is empty I credit the one who sent me
The most BEAUTIFULLEST woman and she ridin with me

[Hook Two: LaToiya Williams]
(I'll do it all) I'll do it all wit'cha, go through any door wit'cha
It doesn't matter I will, go against the law wit'cha
Just know you live through me; your love is all I need
If you ain't know you make me, no one's ever shown you baby
To tell the truth {?} you've got me goin crazy
Your love so real to me; and that's all that I, can see

[LaToiya Williams]
This is a thing I wanna feel forever, and I ain't goin nowhere
Cause you mean so much to me
No matter how my people try to doubt ya, I know the truth about ya
It doesn't matter to me
Baby I love you and I always told ya, I'm always here to hold ya
Cause you do so much for me
No matter how they try they can't deceive us, nothin can come between us
Cause you mean so much to me

[Busta Rhymes]
Listen; trust me and I will trust you, I ain't into tryin to fuss boo
Deeper than any lust, I'm only tryin to mindfuck you
That's probably why and maybe I can nickname you my baby
Now that you made me a man you're officially now my lady
Despite the stormy weather I cherish your love forever
And nourish everything we have 'til we grow old together
I'll never trick you, mislead or try to be shaky wit'chu
I only wanna make all the rest of my babies wit'chu

[Hook One] w/ ad libs + [Hook Two] w/ ad libs



[Intro: Busta Rhymes + Eminem]
Yeah! Guess who it is!
Ayo, Dre, I think they in trouble
Whoo!
Scott Storch, why you have to do it like this to 'em?!
Feels like a new day!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Listen, now every time I come
And I hit you niggas with shit regardless
You get retarded and then niggas ain't got a clue
On how the fuck I do what I do and say what I say
And spit what I spit you ain't never even gotta question who
‘Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that can ever come
And spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin' zoo
Then I come and I spit c-crazy sh-sh-sh-shit
And m-m-m-make n-n-niggas do exactly what I want 'em to
From my point of view, instead of trying to step up
You still trying to play catch up
And keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggas panic and freakin' get schizophrenic
And let they emotions out
And I doubt they can ever test my crew
Take a second, check it, I reckon my records are better than
Whatever record you recorded, that's why your shit is through
You fuckin idiot, I don't think you get it
I'm one of the greatest ever, period, every syllable is true

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't blind
And if you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll…

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Shit on a mic and do do, my doo-doo, you do not have a fightin' chance to move you, you were covered in my poo-poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid do-do-do-do-do-do g-g-g-goobers are glued to you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do, do you?
So just sit back and watch somethin'
You just gon have an a-chew
You just made me sneeze, I'm allergic to beats like these
Please excuse me, my allergies are actin' up; thanks a lot, Scott
You're probably wonderin' why there's thunder
And everyone is runnin' and duckin' up
Under everything up on the block
‘Cause Busta Bus and Flipmode just tip toed into the club
Then with Shady quietly trying not to start up a riot with Doc
But since we all been spotted
We might as well have a party
So gather 'round everybody, come on, let's get our drink on
And you ain't got to do nothin' special for this occasion
Just reach in the closet, put something on, and get to the club

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't blind
And if you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll…

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas
You bunch of bumblin' fools
Who got me rumblin' dudes all way down the block
Keep on stumblin' and jumblin' over their words and vowels
Throw in the towel, see you niggas is on the clock
And you runnin' out of time, see, I'm tired of all y'all
M-m-m-mumblin-m-m-mumblin', n-n-nigga I got it locked
Every single time you put my shit in your CD player
And turn up the volume
You bang your head, because your shit is not
I continue with crumblin' niggas and tumblin' niggas
You struggle while I humble a nigga with the Glock
Then I watch you while I'll keep on fumblin'
While I got you tr-tr-tremblin'
Before one of my niggas bust your head with a rock
Before I start to do another thing
Then to make you crown me the king
With such a butter swing, nigga, follow the flock
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds to summer bling
While I'm climbing and fuck her
Then tell you bitch to get off my jock

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't blind
And if you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll…



[Intro: Mike Epps]
Yeah, they call me P-Shake, I'm a number runner
And I just wanna let you know I'm getting that Arab Money
I'm getting that Chinese money
I'm getting that motherfucking British Columbia money
Nigga basically what I'm saying, your dollar ain't shit!
You feel me? And bullshit ain't nothing but chewed up grass
And that's a big black ball that come out of a cow's ass
So the next time you see that annointed bitch you know
Bend her, spin her, and go up in her, and let her know
Bitch, there is no dinner
These are the reasons and these are the numbers that I got for ya
And it's 13.. 20.. 27.. 38
25, 27, 13, 20, 27th, 38's
Doo doo do do dooooooo

[Hook 2X: Mike Epps]
I'm a go and get my *25* over on *27*
Be back in *13* minutes or even *20*
Be back with *27* niggas with them *38's*
Doo doo do do dooooooo

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
See there was this situation with a couple niggas I was peeping
The way they was moving analyzing the shit they was doing in the club Grilling and screwing they faces up
Front like they chilling and moved a couple paces up, playing me close
But I'm saying we most...ly be in a spot
Celebrating something and probably making a toast
Party till we probably shaking the coast
And hardly ever start a problem unless you gotta
I'm sayin we supposed to be enjoying ourself nigga
Cause we entrepreneurs and gwop connoisseurs employing ourself nigga
Exploiting my wealth with the company I'm keeping
Until a hater came and got to annointing himself to be
The one to come in it, and had a couple dudes to support him
Acting all extra like he had the thing on him
Then after we finish beating on him, now he know we ain't playing
That's when he walked away saying

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Shit is really bug to me how some of these niggas they be coming
And setting theyself up till you hit them and getting theyself up
In these altercations they don't really be needing
Until it's too late, then they realize that a body part is bleeding
Instead of being out and enjoying the people
They be acting all tough, yapping and bluffing instead of being peaceful
These partially thugs be spreading like cancer
Fronting like gangsters until you bust they head now they looking like dancers
While they leaning and they rocking with after
You could've avoided *BEEF!* The shit is annoying, *CHIEF*
Cause now you got the bouncer stopping the door, killing
Nobody else is getting in cause we mopping the floor with you
Instead you could have came to party and BS and deaded the fronting
Bag you a chick, while you sipping on something
But instead you chose to do something that made us lump your shit up
For playing, now what the fuck is he saying?

[Hook]

[Outro: Mike Epps]
Who did it?
Which one of y'all niggas hit me in my motherfuckin..
Where my earring at? Where my keys?
Why y'all them niggas hit me in my motherfuckin jaw like that?
Where my keys at? Where my shoe?
I can't find my shoe, you hit me in the jaw nigga?
Is that the one? Nah, whassup though - how you doin?
Which one of y'all niggas hit me in my jaw man?
How y'all conceal it? Somebody go call my girl
Somebody hit me in my jaw
I got Medicade nigga that's alright
Y'all hit me in my motherfuckin jaw like that
I tell y'all, y'all pussy, don't feel it
Nigga I got a brother that's a Crip
Nigga I got another brother that's a Blood
We gon' tear this motherfucker up y'all niggas hit
Y'all done hit the wrong nigga now!!
Y'all hit the wrong nigga!!
Y'all gon' sit there and let.. I'mma sue this club!
I'm suin this muh'fuckin club cause y'all security guards
Sit there and let them niggas jump on me like that!
Bitch-ass...

[Hook]



[Busta Rhymes]
You know, my homey Treach from Naughty By Nature once said
If you ain't from the ghetto, don't come to the fucking ghetto
But I'mma let one of our most immaculate tour guides
Take us all through the ghetto - my nigga Rick James!

[Rick James - sampled from "Ghetto Life"] + (backup singers)
When I was a young boy, growing up in the ghetto!
Hanging out on corners, singing with the fellas
Looking for the cute chicks, trying to find me big fun
Looking for some trouble, or anyone who'll give me some
I was young and crazy! (In the ghetto)
Didn't know what my life would be (In the ghetto)
I was dumb and oh so lazy (In the ghetto)
Something had a spell on me (In the ghetto)
You all know what I'm talking about (Talking about ghetto life)
(Talking about ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singing about (Talking about ghetto life)
Ghetto life (Talking about ghetto life)

[Busta Rhymes]
(In the ghetto) Sure we be taking them chances
While we search for the answers we be smoking them cancer sticks
Police provoking motherfuckers we dancing
And we be dodging them bullets they be popping off at us, shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood until somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good, so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry - hey nigga we playing for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it, we will take if we want it
See niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle until we sicker with the shine
In the struggle, thus our money come quicker doing crime
I see the way we rep the hood, gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto, but you can't take it from me
Gotta love it

[Hook: Rick James] + (backup singers)
(Talkin about ghetto life)
Ghetto life (Talking about ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singing about (Talkin about ghetto life)
Ghetto life (Talking about ghetto life)

[Busta Rhymes]
(In the ghetto) That's where we get into that street shit
Hustle hard, try to get money quick (In the ghetto)
That's where I got my name from
I learned to get money and I got all my game from (In the ghetto)
That's where you eat with a bunch of the wolves
And get to hustling as hard as you could (In the ghetto)
Until your cake stacking shit'll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood (In the ghetto)
With them burnout cellys
Talk crazy, sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And then piss in elevators 'til the lobby all smelly (In the ghetto)
That's where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics
Ain't nothing like the hood nigga, I don't care
You surviving in the ghetto you can make it anywhere
Gotta love it

[Hook]

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
To my East coast niggas - rep your ghetto
West coast niggas - rep your ghetto
Midwest niggas - rep your ghetto
Down South niggas - rep your ghetto
To my East coast niggas - rep your ghetto
West coast niggas - rep your ghetto
Midwest niggas - rep your ghetto
To my Dirty South niggas - rep your ghetto

[Busta Rhymes]
(In the ghetto) Even though they act rude
You'll always find a good chick to hold a brick for they dude
Behind the bullshit, me and my clique on the move
We honor the code of the street, and live by the rules (In the ghetto)
Is where, all of the hood's at
Find the most crooks and they sell the most drugs at
Where you find beautiful women and rugrats
And some of the most powerful people, I love that!
Come mon

[Outro: Rick James] + (backup singers)
(Talking about ghetto life)
You all know what I'm talking about (Talking about ghetto life)
(Talkin about ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singing about (Talking about ghetto life)
Ghetto life (Talking about ghetto life)
(In the ghetto)

"Never mind who you thought I was, I'm Rick James BITCH!" {*applause*}
"Cocaine is a hell of a drug"



(Phone rings twice, then picked up)

No question. Lets get straight to it

[Clive Davis]
Well Busta Rhymes
It's been a long time since you've had a good talking to
And the last time I gave you my blessing
I told ya, you was gonna encounter a lot of niggas and bitches
Tryin' to get into your shit
Well, you've come a long ways
Since me, the bad ass Dolemite paid you a visit
And even up to this point
You ain't seen shit yet
From what I understand
You done built you a brand new home
So this time around
Before you welcome these motherfuckers in yo shit
Make sure they know the rules
Rule Number 1:
Busta Rhymes is your name
And breaking motherfuckers down
Is your game
Rule Number 2:
As you continue to give it to 'em raw
Before they come into your house
Make sure they wipe they feet
At the motherfuckin door
Rule Number 3:
Before these niggas misconceive you as a pranksta
Make sure these motherfuckers respect your gangsta
Now moving right along
As you enter this new place in your growth
Like I told you before:
Keep slappin' dick in the mouth of these bitches
That don't wanna act right
And put a hot one in any motherfucker
That tries to get in the way of this power move shit right here
Alright Busta, enough with this shit talkin
Let's welcome these motherfuckers into THE Genesis
Alright baby
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go



(Intro)
Daddy can I sing a song please?
Thank you

(Verse)
Hush other rappers don't you cry
Flipmode is back and you all gon' die
Lotta ya'll niggas really think its all good
That live a lot safer 'cause you moved out the hood
Its too late for you to try to call a truce
We targeting you niggas like a snipre on the loose
Better watch your head
And watch how you talk
Watch where you sleep
Watch where you walk
Always be aware of the choice you make
Every turning point, every route you take
The crazy shit I feel every time I have the the thought
I yell (?) since the dawning of New York
Now we're seeing shit we never thought we'd see before
If you ain't realize, It Ain't Safe No More
If you ain't realize, It Ain't Safe No More
If you ain't realize, It Ain't Safe No More
Hehehe
(Gunshots/Chaos)

(Outro: Busta Rhymes)
Fuck this shit, uh
Fuck
Yea, unfortunately for a lotta you motherfuckers
We bout to run up in your shit
And give it to you in a way you might not be prepared to deal with
But it is what it is
And it ain't motherfucking safe no more!



The Surgeon General.. of the Flipmode Squad..
Has determined.. that the sounds you about to hear..
Can be devestatin.. to your ear.. to your mind..
To your body.. to your souuuuuuuuuuuuuullll!

[Hook: Flipmode + Meka]
You better, pack up your bags, better get out of town
Cause when the God come you know he gon' be puttin it down
Everything we do be blowin, better get on the ground
It ain't safe no more, it ain't safe no more (nigga)
He keeps it wicked by creatin the sound
That make the people wanna spaz 'til they give him the crown
Fuck around you'll turn up missin just to never be found
It ain't safe no more, it ain't safe no more (nigga)

[Verse One]
Bodies'll turn up missin, I promise you need to listen
Abolish the need for bitchin, I polish and shine and glisten
Demolishin while I'm whistlin, astonished while you're witnessed
Hardest to smash another artist son, regardless if it is
A nigga who think he the greatest son I'll lock him in the fridge
And hang him from both of his ankles when we drop him from the bridge
Blockin your paper really stoppin that dude from gettin his
Poppin the safe and splurgin, havin the crew up in the crib
Block 'til these niggas havin 'em rockin gargle with a bib
Shittin and fartin, spittin and vomitin all in the crib
Fallin into shock from the bullets we shot up in they ribs
Hot up the block and blew up the spot and got up out the mix
Tried it a couple stops and spotted the Squad up in they whips
Plotted and then I signed on the dotted line and made a wish
Return us even the hardest makin you garbage niggas sit
The smartest now you a target only the heartless niggas win

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
You can't believe can you, I'm callin my dog Nathaniel
And ballin with all my mans you'll be blowin and all will hand you
Accordingly or disorderly bullets are sure to bang you
Considerably my 9 milli hit you at any angle
Shootin, shootin, shootin - high, low, verticle or horizontal
And if you were makin plans I do think you gon' have to cancel
Sorry I had to ask you, save it I have to blast you
Takin a chance to laugh from you makin the masses gas you
So now you thinkin that you tough and that we can't get at you
Change up your mind and leave you stiffer than a massive statue
Tired of talkin need to use all your precautionary measures
Washin off the blood haulin the water force of steady weather
You can handle it or you can't, it be only gettin better
Like a candle, we burn your chandles and make you feel the pressure
Cockin it back, articulatin the flow just like a lecture
Break it down and rebuildin the flow, now peep the architecture

[Hook]

It ain't safe.. in the current state.. of our democracy
Terrorism.. motherfuckers bombin New York.. shit is crazy
It ain't safe no more!
All these rappin niggas goin at other rappin niggas heads
Shit is crazy! But most importantly..
The most unsafe thing.. is that.. niggas ain't seein, the God comin
Watch where you walk!

Yeah I know
A lot of you niggas don't plan on the day when you'd have to see me
You see - I'm that nigga that you should really be afraid of
I dig graves for niggas like you
We gon' get more acquainted at a time when you least expect it

[Hook 2X: female singer]
Do you ever think (do you ever think)
What life would be (what life would be)
Where you will go (where will you go)
After you die (after you die)

[Death] You fucked up nigga!

[Busta Rhymes]
You know that when that time comes and nobody is checkin
And everything you had is gone in the split of a second
That's when it starts hittin the fan and it gets real in this bitch
Just face the fact your shit's a wrap and you gotta deal with the shit
Despite I talk about it, I ain't makin fun of them niggas
I give thanks cause I've been blessed and I ain't one of them niggas
Can't imagine how difficult it is, I know you suspect
That shit around you is lookin dumb, it's gettin hard to accept it
Alone in the mirror, you look at yourself and you smile
Disregarding the fact your running's been done for a while
Refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child
Continue frontin, like it's nothin while you live in denial
While all your people around you start to leave you in the same place
You overexert the little you have left to save face
You tryin to hide your expression from lookin worried
On what to do when your career is buried

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Niggas ain't GIVIN a fuck about your flows no more
You ain't the star you were, fuckin the same hoes no more
Promoters ain't payin and bookin you for shows no more
You ain't whippin the Range, you ain't whippin a Rolls no more
Reality starts to settle in, you're sweatin every wake up
You're broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to Jacob
You run around and you front like you're still on fire
But nobody believes you; and now you live as a liar
You're onnly lyin to yourself cause it's evident in the proof
As your world continues to crumble, come to terms with the truth
You're still holdin on to them days when everything was about you
But niggas don't even remember you enough to just shout you
I remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully
The problem was you didn't know when to bow out gracefully
Once told, never burn out, it's best to fade away
Preserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day
People see you and it's bugged that you mean nothin
You doin shit and front to prove to people you mean somethin
It happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in
You step to the door of the club and see that you ain't gettin in
Forgettin you a man first, chasin the fame
Got to remember, morals and principles, reppin your name proper
But most niggas don't, and they whole life hurried
What do you do when your career is buried

[Hook]

Okay
I told you we was gonna get more acquainted
At a time when you least expect it nigga
I'm here to lay you to rest once and for all [coughing]
You've been dead a long time but you refuse to accept that shit
But it's okay [coughing]
Nigga shut the FUCK UP AND GET IN THE BOX NIGGA! (WAIT!! Please!)
It was custom built for all niggas like you [lid closes]
You just don't wanna accept when it's time to hang it up
(Stop! BITCH!) See you in the afterlife nigga (Wait! HELP!!!)
WHEVER THE FUCK THAT IS!! (SOMEBODY HELP!!)
(I CAN'T BREATHE, NIGGA!)
(OPEN THIS SHIT NIGGA!)
(OPEN THIS SHIT!! [knocking])
(OPEN THIS SHIT!! [knocking])
[Incoherent scream]
(SOMEBODY HELP!! HEY!!)
(OPEN THIS SHIT MOTHERFUCKER WHAT YOU DOIN)
(OPEN IT!)

Girl your skin tone pretty and you love top wear Vickey
Sport Gucci and Gabbana when you love the world is sticky
Got a, crib in the city with a cherry eight fifty
We could cruise down the avenue and shop till you dizzy
Throw some karats in your pinky have your neck and wrist blingy
I could bless you with it all boo but never say gimme
We can, pop yellow bottles push whips in all models
Vroom vroom on the Calisport instead of Gucci goggles

Hit me up later we can go somewhere and kick it boo
The name is Spliff baby I'll make you man hate me
Cause my shit's steak and gravy plus my pipe gettin crazy baby

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Incase you ain't know and incase you ain't heard
And if you want us to set it just give me the word

[Bridge: Busta Rhymes]
I say come on if your ready, we wylin all night

Busy dodgin a nigga because she wanna ride, come on if ya....

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
All ready we come to muscle y'all women

Strip, yell or purr her off show me that butter soft
Open wide ma swallow when I let it off, yo

Incase you ain't know and incase you ain't heard

Spit that venom; pretty thick bitches walk by
If you let 'em pussy printin through they denim
Take her for a ride 'round the block, let her enjoy the whip
Drop her off, let her walk the strip
Ain't it funny how nature work?
Make bitches wanna bounce on a nigga 'til they make it hurt, c'mon

[Hook]
Shake yo' shit until you make it hurt
Throw yo' pussy 'til you make it hurt

Drastic measures I´m spreadin' like a rash bitch
Class is in session you ´bout to get yo´ ass kicked
Emperor of every roundtable of the house

It's Flipmode baby, yea, come on
We bout to cause a riot nigga

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Got a lot of niggas rollin' with ya holla
Cause you know we ripped it hotter than them other niggas
Spot a nigga gettin dollars not another nigga
Can do it the way that we cocked and shot another nigga
Think he deserved the way he was boppin with a cherry copper
Glitter blood fella send a cop to get 'em
It's funny the way the iron just to drop you quicker
Why I hit y'all with the fire, think I got a winner
Stackin a crib with a chick that make a proper dinner
Black in the range with tint, and chrome aqua spinnin'
Parked right next to the Benz with a soap opera and the TV
Up in the dash co-starrin a opera singer
That be the type of bullshit I be on and stay hot
I stop whippin' a Bentley to whip a Mercedes Maeboch
And keep runnin' around the street like my name was Mel Patch nigga
Come through your hood and take your whole block, come on
And while we give it to ya

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
While with me (Come on)
My niggas stack money to the sky with me (Come on)
My niggas in the place need to riot with me (Come on)
And set the whole fire with me (Come on)
All of my ladies in the beauty salon look bomb put yo shit on
And wait up in the line for me (Come on)
You come all in the party lookin' fine for me (Come on)
Holdin 'Gnac spill a little red wine for me

[Bridge: Busta Rhymes] 9x
Let's cause a riot
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo (Come on)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
It's bout to get a little bit betta, start to get a little cheddar
Pack a big beretta
Check a nigga resume doin' a alphabet-ah
Go order and brandish the metal hid into ya leather
No matter or whether or not you wearin' a vest
So you got your hand on the cannon I got a bigger plan for ya
Call up my mans for ya, now watch you vanish
Makin' you family ask for ya
You think you family pay a couple of grand for ya?
Like you afraid to hold a mac, like you were made to hold a gat
We made a hole and quikly dug out all the sand for ya
The heat'll be makin' you put it on the glass shorty
Wiggle somethin' and get to showin' a little ass for me (Bling!)
Now lets get on and open smokin' and blast for thee
Niggas will really want it and fill the capacity
You muthafuckin' know it has to be
The way we touch it y'all niggas knowin exactly who the master be
And while we give it to ya

[Hook : Busta Rhymes]
While with me (Come on)
My niggas stack money to the sky with me (Come on)
My niggas in the place need to riot with me (Come on)
And set the whole fire with me (Come on)
All of my ladies in the Beauty Salon look bomb put yo shit on
And wait up in the line for me (Come on)
You come all in the party lookin' fine for me (Come on)
Holdin' Yach spill a little red wine for me

[Bridge: Busta Rhymes] 9x
Let's cause a riot
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo (Come on)



[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
As we go way beyond sky's the limit, and you know who we are
We shootin for the moon and land on the starrrrrrrrrrrrrs
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars
We 'bout to do it real big like outta this world and we takin it far
Shootin for the moon and land on the starrrrrrrrrrrrrs
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us

[Busta Rhymes]
Now don't you think this shit's outrageous?
At this point if you don't see I'm one of the greatest
I play the long time up in the league with the majors
In every history book they add a couple more pages
Like - about the way I take 'em through stages
On different levels, peep the way it read on the gauges
Regardless I'mma love 'em, I don't care how they hate us
No matter how they try, see they could never replace us
Like - mommy always said beware of the dangers
Embrace genuine love, be careful of strangers
Cause when you are the best they try to weaken and change us
They don't recognize at first but always do when you're famous
Like - I live my life bold and courageous
And invest my time and always calculatin my wages
And let me lead the march, they'll probably start to parade us
Because you know that I'm comin to SAVE US

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
I spread my wings takin off properly
I laugh at muh'fuckers that'll think they can top me
I laugh harder cause somebody said that they dropped me
When I'm flyin through the sky now how the hell they gon' stop me
Like - most of the time it's good to be patient
Now I'm back with the crack, sorry for keepin you waitin
Prepare the food right for the street and season the steak and
Grab a champagne glass and put it up, we celebratin
Like - and tell me who you tryin to race with (who?)
If you ain't notice nigga I be ridin a spaceship
I'm light years ahead and way beyond all the fake shit
I gotta stay away from trash because I probably'll break shit
Like - I know it's kinda hard to believe this (why?)
The way I always come back and return with the heat bitch
This shit ain't a secret, son it's hard to defeat this
Risin out the ashes, flyin like a PHOENIX

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
See now you see I'm back in the zone, B
And it feels good to be home with Sylvia Rhone see
Back to smash on the planet, niggas know I'm the only
One to be back with the authentic to smash all the phonies
Like - we mostly do the thing that you can't teach
And then send 'em a rhyme into that bullshit you can't reach
Then I give you shit that make the hood wanna bang in the street
And state my word is bond, I live out what I SPEAK nigga!

[Hook]



Yeah.. back by popular demand, it's about to get Godly
Yeah.. hold it now! AOWWW!
C'mon, c'mon (c'mon).. yeah
Huh.. c'mon, c'mon (c'mon).. yeah
Huh!

[Busta Rhymes]
Bear witness on the way we stay cuttin 'em down
In two-thousand-two, shuttin 'em down
Have you sippin on it 'til you start suckin it down
I hope you know that we ain't FUCKIN around
Niggas you betta BELIEVE when you see me the shit be double trouble
I overLOAD and take this SHIT to another level
I shut it down, sho' nuff, pack ya bags
Let me work, make it hurt, cause I'm next wreck
Lay flat nigga hit the deck, or face big DISrespect
In addition the SHIT we wreck
Firework flow, spit and make a BIG effect
Bang it in the truck until ya whole SHIT eject, c'mon
Stop nigga, close ya shop
SCUD missile launched fire burn quick, every SHIT we drop
From the GROUND with another sound yes we put it down
And always BOOM and pound, so we shut 'em down

[Hook: Busta Rhymes] + (Pete Rock)
I shut 'em down (shut 'em down, shut shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (sh-sh, sh-sh, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (shut 'em down, shut shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (shut 'em, sh-shut, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (shut 'em down, shut-sh-shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (sh-sh, sh-sh, shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (shut 'em down, shut shut shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (shut 'em down, shut shut 'em down)

[Busta Rhymes]
Hah!
One two three four five six seven eight nine
Comin THROUGH, betta tuck in ya shine
Once ya lookin for the HEAT, if ya seek it will find
I had these devils watchin me sayin these sneakers is mine!
Now hold up - we drop the bomb first then get under ya mom's skirt
To get her frenzied like a motherfuckin rock concert
While you're busy and tryin to FIGURE what the God's worth
I'll malfunction your plans 'til the motherfuckin sound work
Now I'mma CUSS when I BUST ya ass
And leave 'em stiff when I hit 'em like a MUSTARD gas
Steam fire when I puff, then I flick the ash
You wack and I had enough, put your shit in the trash
Now you know we got the shit in the smash
Wild until you slip and you crash, y'know we keep the SHIT in the stash
From the GROUND when we come around, yes we put it down
And always BOOM AND POUND, when we shut 'em down

[Hook] - w/ minor variations

[Intro to "Genesis"]
As we rockin you all to the future
Ahhh, we come to give you that
Operatin like we be official
Yeah, we come to multiply
And we're plannin the scheme for the long win
Yeah, our shit be always right
Every move you'll see how it's related..



[Hook: repeat 2X]
Listen; I am the sun, I am the sea
I am the land, I am the tree
I'm everything you want to be
Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D
Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D
Cause I be struttin' like a G.O.D

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Roll out the red carpet baby the god has come
No matter who you are or where you from
Check it I stay be repin the street and reppin the slum
And while you co-starrin' this movie I star is the one, listen
You never imagined that I would become one of the most incredible
Until when ever I'm done
Notice the god like meet you from when I was young
Blessed with such immaculate flow and a venomous tongue
How we keep you holla until you collapse on the lung
With the biggest followin' the nigga slackin a nun
Able to move a mountain of niggas havin then sprung
Just check out my women but how be havin then strung ass though
Like how the coke be havin them numb
Run up in the spot like I was holdin and clappin' the gun
Now I'm lose for y'all I'm bringin the proof to y'all
Ballin and speckin the truth to y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
The chorus is singin' the words that I fill in my gut
That's why I always step with a bop and walk with a strut
And I always rep for the block and we all for the bucks
And we always step in the spot and be all for the cut
Vallet block two parkin' spots all for the turck
Bounce to the world when I be tired and be gone for the month
And it's all for the slut flowin' like a force of the water
Keepin' it runin so were the niggas be at
Well they seein me commin'
Summers people keep it clapin' women just give me they lovin'
They way the streets be fillin' the kid they really be buggin'
Like I'm there dearly beloved my soldiers really be thuggin
Or how I really be slugging' the ball out the ball park
Keep them whilin' then ten minutes later then it's sawed off
Create a small spark then down to the levels to make the walls stark
Testin' the God I think he be needin' them all off

[Hook]

[Bridge: Busta Rhymes]
Listen
I keeps the hustle up in my vain
Cause it's all in my blood
Feel my pain
Feel my love
Feelin' niggas struggle till the other one

[Hook] - repeat 3X

Getin' to struttin' like the G.O.D
Listen

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I'm sayin' we comin' through when I'm blockin' the light
Niggas think they rockin' the crowd but ain't rockin' it right
Make the people shout to the sound and rock for the night
Cause I stay in the struggle ready rock for the fight
I stay whipin' the truck and leanin' and rock what I like
And quadruple my money more than the block of the white
We sayin' we bout china while we stopin' your rules(?)
How I be rockin' the diamonds like I'm dropin them jewels

[Hook]



[Intro: Busta]
Yeah, ay baby
Put your hand on my heart
Tell me if you ever felt a heartbeat like this, like this (like this)

[Hook: Jelly Roll]
Boom boom boom boom boom!
Is the sound that you hear from my heart beatin hard like a bass drum
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom!
As my blood starts to race through my veins, all I want is to be close to you
I like you in those boots, you know just what to do
Girl let me see those tattoos, I'm gon' ride with you
Right here's the perfect place, for me to kiss and fuck you
I can't wait to taste your, sugar!

[Busta Rhymes]
I wanna taste your body (yeah) I wanna taste your face
Wanna taste your breasts, taste below your waist (uh-huh)
{*slurps*} That's some of my many wishes
Fresh out the bubble bath girl, you taste so delicious
From when you leave to go to work and how you blow me kisses (yes!)
The way you come back to the crib and cook and wash the dishes (right)
It's kinda hard to fight it, once the fire is ignited
You feel my heartbeat baby? You got me so excited

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
I can't explain the feelin, it's such an amazin thing
You're like a prize possession (man) a gift to any king
(Aw shit girl) My wings, is only here to protect us (uh-huh)
No matter what we go through (no matter what) and how it might affect us
Tired of the lectures, a piece to tell me chill
But they don't really understand, what I'm tryin to build (I got you)
But I brush it off as nothin, baby let me tell you somethin (listen)
Every single time I see you my adrenaline be rushin

[Hook]

[Jelly Roll]
You're body's smokin' like a Newport, better yet a Backwood
You like it in the backseat cause baby girl you're that hood
I've never had it how you put it on me (on me)
The way you move is makin me horny (horny)
But I just wanna kiss ya, all over your body
Stretch you like Pilate's, baby let's get naughty
Doin how we do, fuckin all around the house
Started on the bed and ended up on the couch

[Busta Rhymes]
Damn, I touch you and you touch me, we get closer
And ya hold me like you're holdin on for dear life, boldly
And we go out on the balcony and let our bodies wrap up
And we fuck until the sun come up, housekeeping come and catch us
I don't care though, you takin it, I'm givin it and breakin
Everything up in the room like a tornado in the makin
And I'm lovin and embracin baby let me take you down
And while you give it to me let me give it back girl listen to the sound
As it goes

[Hook]



[Busta Rhymes - talking]

[Busta Rhymes]
Check out the technique
C'mon, spit flow and bag up the next freaks
Soldier wit a quicker ho that a live on the next street
Over playa then do this shit again next week
Gettin this paper, phat chicks up in the next Jeep
Probably listen closer if you let the check speak
I keep fire cause niggas respect heat
Look, I spit fire then come up the best beats
I said I pull the spot from here way down on South Beach major
Globalize, then blow down a South Beach ager
Check it, banana yellow G wagon for the whole saggin
Feel the fox mink draggin on the floor watch it
You really need to stop
Just copped the rob blueberry Lamborghini drop
C'mon, stay struntin with the mini bop
Niggas know when we step in the place, the whole city stop

[Hook - Busta Rhymes] (Meka)
Better tell 'em if they ain't know, put 'em on shorty

[Busta Rhymes]
This is a shake down (c'mon)
Weakin your whole shit ' til it break down (uh huh)
Speak to the whole clique 'til we take down dudes
Put the heat to 'em make them put the cake down dude (dude)
Scrape down food (food), niggas stay hungry 'til the shit is over
Spit and make the tape sound rude
Ha, niggas get screwed, see they ain't really worth not a thing
But only gettin on the stage to get booed
Kennedy loft hoes mackin at the top of the Trump Towers
Rockin fly Versace, cherry cloth robes (robes)
Like ghostface the most ready just for the glow
Showcase the most, them niggas sure to blow
No waste a time, you know we sure to grow
I'm sayin no place a mine, is for them corny hoes
C'mon, with all this paper and the shit we copin
We keepin it gully and know we always keep it poppin

[Hook]

[Break - Busta Rhymes & Meka]
Ha, get that money

Hands in the sky

Say take it off (YOU BETTER TAKE IT OFF)
Say take it off (TAKE IT OFF)
Say take it off (BETTER TAKE IT OFF)

[Busta Rhymes]
C'mon, ha, we hold a rock boy
The way we on fire call a nigga hot boy
Hot, we raise the level to we blow the spot boy
And watch the water boil and spill over the pot boy
Listen, I hope you know you need to stop boy

[Repeat 5x (Taste it, taste it, taste it)]
Here we go

Yeah, soldiers
We 'bout to line it up just right
Check it, watch how we do it

[Verse One]
Make way for the kid to come in girl
And let me rock cause I love the way you pop that (C'mon)
Every single time we come to drop that
A lot of freaky women react to a nigga hot track (Lets go)
Then we start to cook up the place
Women watching the nigga with the ready to do the (UGH!) look on their face
(C'mon)
Freak nasty, you know the way you do it all on the guard
And the way you love to speak nasty, another freak pass me (WOO!)
Floss on, in the club ain't even got the draws on
You messing with a nigga better, stop that shit mama
In other words you better watch that shit cause you got that shit
The way your ass sit up all on your back
Its like you need to go shop that, see niggas would cock that
And definitely won't waste it
And while you at it take a lick and just taste it (taste it, taste it, taste it)

[Hook]
B-b-baby tell me why tell me so
I'd like you to go high you tell me to go low
So I go low, taste the shit, taste it again I like it
Baby tell me why tell me so
I'd like you to go high you tell me to go low
So I go low, taste the shit, taste it again I like it

[Verse 2]
Pass the last courvoisier bottle down the at bar
See a chick that kinda look like a star
And I'm saying even though I wanna to take you home girl
I know its kinda late but you ain't got to come along girl {*echo*}
Wait a sec you know I know a song girl
Me and you and one of your other home girls {*echo*}
Let me put it down and we started to bone girl
The other had a heat "I thought ya'll be gettin' along girl?" {*echo*}
Just put the pep in your step, what's with all the emotional shit
You know we be swingin' a hep
Put it on me like I wouldn't recover
Saying two chicks that was beefin' and touching and feeling each other
Word to mother, now we having a ball
The way we knockin' as the sound of the bed head smackin' the wall
Baby I'm saying I lovin' how you rubbin'
And the way that you lace it and rush it when you gettin' ready to taste it
Baby I love it, the way you rub it
And the way you lace it and rush it when you gettin' ready to taste it

[Hook]

[Hook]
Girl I know you wanna

Ladies! If you want your man to get down and
(Taste it, taste it, taste it)
Just throw your hands in the air, fella's just make it do it too
(Taste it, taste it, taste it)
Now you can both do it

[Verse Three]
Shorty hit me all on the two-way
Tell me to meet her way in the back by the couches up inside the cheetah
Then I step up in the club keep it moving wit' my hand on my heater
Stay alert and never moving the sleeper
Even though this shit was way off the meter
Couldn't believe her
Shorty buggin' and giving me head in back of the speaker
Now check it, I love the way she step to it and how she's keepin' it basic
And always be ready to taste it

[Hook]

[Repeat till end (Haah! taste it, taste it, taste it)]

[Hook]
Now this is the tale of a murderer who comes from the caucus cliffs
(busta in background) happy Thanksgiving
He robbed and stole and killed for greed and packed us on slave ships
(busta in background) happy Thanksgiving
He took us off to stolen lands it seemed like hell for sure
(busta in background) happy Thanksgiving
With the crack and the guns, death and disease they called for you and your
(busta in background) happy Thanksgiving
No whips no brew no weed to smoke not a single luxury
If not for the bloodshed that it cost the struggle would be lost
(busta) say it again
The struggle would be lost
(busta) say it again
The struggle would be lost
(busta) say it again
The struggle would be lost
(busta) say it again
The struggle would be lost
(busta) say it again
The struggle would be lost

[Verse 1]
The struggle will be lost
If you continue to do the shit you be doin' with disloyalty nigga
Now that explains why in each ward you avoiding me nigga
Knowing now it takes nothing to be destroying a nigga
Conditioned with a mind to shit on your brother
Flossing with jewelry and whips just like a dick and still live with your mother
Copping shit that superceded your salary
Where is your loyalty to your own blood and taking care of your family
Funny how you sit and drink what you drink
Thinking the foulest shit and not even knowing why you think how you think
Must be the reason why we aren't aware
Because the devil know how guilty and filthy he is in all his affairs
Fucking with my mind when I was a youngster
Cause he know if we knew the truth we'd make his ass run from amongst us
That's why we thinking that it's better to ball
While the devil be sitting and watching plotting how to murder us all
Now this

[Hook ]

[Verse 2]
Hey yo
That's why I'm hustling harder
Now I'm in a huddle seeing the struggle in my mother and father
That's why my persona will come with such a karma to be getting this paper
Cause I ain't with the slavery labor
A lot of niggas in the hood probly relate to me greater
Than those that believe when they die they going to meet the creator that's crazy
How we become slaves
To mental death and power that comes with becoming even more of a dumber ass
The devil robbing you blind
Concealing the truth from niggas while we be struggling they murder the mind
The wickedness sneak on you quicker when they creep from behind
Continue to speak the truth 'til it weaken your spine
Now check it
The jewel I give you be the beat the beat for the time
You can't see it like you living on a street for the blind
Young whitty hustler niggas that stick with the grind
Fly cuisine food poisoned cause you eatin' the swine
I stay struggling and doin' for delf
Then I dig in my body deeper and do a little knowledge of self
They wonder why they catch a nigga on the weed sell
Better be careful what you saying on them e-mails
Now listen
They got your mind in a prison
You can do whatever you want but focus if you desire to listen
As I say it I hope you feelin' the wrath
Create a hammer to make a man that a beat you in the head with the math
Now this

[Hook]



[Busta Rhymes]
Roll wit a nigga, put on some roller skates (laughs)

All across the board wild they be bouncin my obstacle course now
Sparkle with a gloss pushin a force now
Now I get my wine and dine on, slide on
A dick of a nigga who bust in you to get his shine on

Don't get it twisted or we'll bring the most reliable (what!)
We bringin that shit that be so undeniable

[Hook: Mary]
Y'all wanna know who we with

Underground heat to the club we bring
And you know that we got this
And you know that we got this

[Busta]
(Hugh) Brand new, all the way down the line
From the new bounce the new money down to the newest shine
Wit the new blue nine though I had to bust it a few times
Watch these funny niggas and analyze all the true signs
In due time we will accumulate, illuminate
My click will fuck up the money you allowin your crew to make
Yeah, and while we step up in the hot spot
And fuck with these bitches until somebody start to bust shots
Niggas duck for a second make sure they ain't the ones got
To start the party against me (Ho) and yell blood clot!
Everything be goin on from chicks blowin kisses
Straight wildin out while these niggas surround these freak bitches
Once somebody else started bustin they heat vicious
I started holdin my toast, defendin all my street riches
Up in the club champagne up in the ice bucket
Now these niggas is wildin and throwin they drinks (Fuck it!)

[Hook]

[Mary]
Now don't get mad, cause what you had
Too bad it didn't last
And now we're back on this Busta track
And now the games on smash

[Busta]
Yeah, all my live niggas get yours
Floss heavy, all my bitches bounce on the floor
Check it, squads deep with niggas everybody on
Make the livest motherfuckers wanna bounce to my song
Check it, my niggas organize, analyze the teamwork
And how a bad shorty rockin that Rah Digga T-shirt
And keep it goin while you tag along, swing along
And see my niggas that be reppin while you sing along

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Busta and Mary ad lib]



[Hook: Mr. Porter]
They see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)
They so cold... I know... that they're out to get me
And all those people I call my friends, let it go
That's why I never call on y'all, to be around
Cause you see how this money can change everything

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Geah! See I done came a long way and now I got me a chauffeur
Keep my enemies close, keep my friends even closer
Muhfuckers that I grew around, thought I could rock wit 'em
Watch my cake so hard, they burn a hole in my pocket
I see 'em coming from afar because I been through so much shit
They plot a lot, hard or not, they see my dough come quick
Invested in my niggas, took the realtor route
Gambled on the wrong niggas, had to filter 'em out
Type of dudes that see my mother and they greet her respectful
Behind her back and see her son and try to give me a quick full
It's cool though, I fucks wit 'em even though I ain't wit it
That's why the gats be in the house whenever niggas come visit
Serve 'em drinks and welcome all to the law
For let ya drunk friend to show his true side until ya forced to cut him off
I seen it one too many times, your peeps be leaving you speechless
Sometimes having certain friends can end up being a weakness
See now my dogs turn to wolves and try to front me and surround me
Come up out they sheepskin and act all different around me

[Hook]
They see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)
They so cold... I know... that they're out to get me
And all those people I call my friends, let it go
That's why I never call on y'all, to be around
Cause you see how this money can change everything

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Listen! Sometimes I smoke a cigarette and then I think and I choke on
How niggas steal this funny style and I was struggling broke
Even though it don't surprise me, shit it's still kinda funny
When I ain't have, a nigga still would come and try to take from me
Instead of cutting my losses, being smart and just end shit
Niggas was trying to be loyal, just to maintain a friendship
In the wrong situation, plus there's always a sequel
I'm with the wrong muhfuckers, plus they 'pose to be people's
As I get more money, days get colder
I learned to realize that power only lies in the hands of the beholder
So then I start the heart-on-my-heart as I walk like a soldier
Moving so militant, you think I had a chip on my shoulder
Living by morals and principles mainly
Having heavy thoughts to a kill my brother every time them fuckers betray me
But now I'm winning with the strength of the nation
I promise that they not even foreseeing the size of the shit they'll be facing
I'm Aftermath now, shit's getting worse
Now when those same "friends" see me goin hard that shit be making 'em hurt

[Hook]
They see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)
They so cold... I know... that they're out to get me
And all those people I call my friends, let it go
That's why I never call on y'all, to be around
Cause you see how this money can change everything

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Instead they getting together with me so we both can get rich
When I'm outta town, these niggas busy tryna fuck with my bitch
Same niggas spend they money 'til the shit'll diminish
I hit 'em off and turn around and come right back when it finish
I said I'm tired of these niggas, that'll owe me so much shit
That they can't pay me back for, fuck all the dumb shit
Sometime we can't forgive whatever balances off
'Specially when niggas cross the line that niggas never should cross
Realized and thus I state the same shit, get the Range
The more money niggas get, shit around you will change
Even though niggas'll flip and say, "You the one changed"
Fuck you, they do that just to justify takin your shit from you
The more money I get, I get more dangerous stupid
Cause I been broke before, and I refuse to go back to it
And while I sweep these niggas up under the rug with a broom
If I never see these "friends" again, that shit'll be too soon
Shit is real like every wind in my breath
And that's on everything I love, BLOOD OF MY BLOOD! FLESH OF MY FLESH!

[Hook]
They see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)
They so cold... I know... that they're out to get me
And all those people I call my friends, let it go
That's why I never call on y'all, to be around
Cause you see how this money can change everything



[Busta Rhymes - talking]
Hey yo, yo ..
Yo, hey, yo, yo ..
Hey yo ..
Hey yo yo

[Hook # 1 - Male voice]
You don't know what you got until it's ..
They say you don't know what you got until it's gone
You don't know what you got until it's ..
They say you don't know what you got until it's gone

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey ya ya yo yo ya ya yo
It was the first sign, on the day of my birth I entered the earth blind
Vulnerable to everythin I would first find
Condition of bein' niggas having the worst mind
Becomin weak like we scavengers of the worst kind
From havin nothin to plot and makin the earth mine, makin the earth mine
That's kinda big aspirations for a nigga thats just kinda got on his first grind
But it's aight cause I'm blowin whole on my first shine
Kinda gas quicker than spaz ready to burst mine
And though it seems like obstacles come at the worst time
Goin from being successful to commitin the worst crimes
So quick like a bitch massagin ya whole dick
And bust a nut, and it's over sabotagin ya own shit
We always good when we get it and then abuse
Then regret it, cause as quick as we get it we fuckin lose it
That's what my mother used to tell me

[Hook # 2 - Busta Rhymes] (Male voice)
(You don't know what you got until it's ..)
See they ain't knowin though
(They say you don't know what you got until it's gone)
That's what my mother used to always tell me
(You don't know what you got until it's..)
Hey yo I peep that they ain't knowin though
(They say you don't know what you got until it's gone)
That's what my mother used to always tell me

[Busta Rhymes]
See in a flash they could take it from you like hocus pocus
So count your blessings and baby I hope you stay in focus
Wide awake like I'm drinkin them Capuccino Mochas
Takin on more stress and get to becomin smokers
HA, like the shit they setup just straight provoke us
And fall victim to the shit till it stifle and choke us
I promise you'll find the truth when you done diggin it out
Stop the shiverin nigga I think I just figured it out
You see we thug physically and mentally soft
Kept lyin to yourself, so that your worth and your value is lost
Sometime the feelin of the city is wrong
Why we appreciate 'em all now that 2Pac and Biggie is gone
Somehow I'm seein it clear
I would have rather this value them just as much when both them niggas is here
Yeah, we always good when we get it and then abuse it
Then regret it, cause as quick as we get it we fuckin lose it, listen

[Hook # 2]

[Busta Rhymes]
Extend your hand for the worried and bless 'em if they need you
Don't ever take life for granted and bite the hand that feeds you
Be cautious how you treat people and how the people feel you
Respect niggas or else the karma is coming to kill you
You got it good baby, just get your shit together
Before you lose it and it's over and gone forever
Dress for the stormy weather
Feel the songs, for everyone is personal like I was just writin myself a letter
A lot of niggas be wilin, callin a name
With disrespect, cashin and blightin, throwin salt in the game
I'm sayin, I'm dealin with logic I hope you ain't thinkin I'm rude
But stop ruin the greatest thing thats been given us food
Clothin and shelter when it's cold we be staying warm
Imagine if they just took the music and rap was gone
We always good when we get it and then abuse it
I won't let it cause it's precious and I ain't ready to lose it, listen

[Hook # 2] - 2X

You don't know what you got until it's ..
They say you don't know what you got until it's gone
(*long pause*)
You don't know what you got until it's gone



[Busta Rhymes]
Hey yo Swizz..
This shit sound like some shit
The streets wanna do the merengue to (yeah)
Or dance around a sombrero too, WHOO!!!
Yeah, another special from Flipmode Records
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah here we go!
Streets! Flipmode baby, yeah check it Busta Bus baby
Yeah, Rah Digga now, c'mon
Check it, huh

[Verse: Busta Rhymes]
If you ain't noticed yet I have come wit a throne
See I was gone for a minute but now I'm home
The way I touch it you can feel it in your bones
Fuck wit the kid cause I'm taking you into another zone
See it don't matter what you think or what you say
I always love for the street every single day
You better get down on your knees, you better pray
Cause goin' against the grain of this Squad
I promise you will pay! (WHOO!)
You see Flipmode is the team that I rep forever
Respecting the Code of Honor staying together
It's getting hot I think you should take off the sweater
Rattle and knock all of your troops who goin to get this cheddar
See when we come I'm wondering how they gon' manage
Show em mysteriously watch how they vanish
See when we finish just analyze all the damage
No matter who you are, we accept any and EVERY challenge (yeah)
Yeah yeah, I think we got 'em again this time
Flipmode c'mon!

[Hook - 1: Mynx] {*Busta Rhymes ad-libs*}
I think I - I think wanna say something like this (like this)
People denying that they feeling our shit
So we hit 'em with the really crazy flow (crazy flow)
To let 'em know that we be hitting it fa' sho
Time goes by, in your life
And we're still here together

[Verse: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you know that this is really not a game
The way I put it down you will remember the name
The way we change it up shit is never the same
And when I'm finished I promise I'll have you niggas feel ashamed
For giving the people shit they ain't really loving
It's funny to me but y'all niggas be buggin'
But it's aight because I will continue flooding the streets
With heat for the ladies and niggas who be thugging
And if you want it then bring shit wit open arms (spread love baby)
While I continuously give you niggas bombs
Assalam alaykom wa'alaykom salam
I'm in the abscence of confusion holding the world in my palms
I'm tired of telling you there ain't nothing greater
Swinging the torch and repping for Violator
So tell the DJ to go and turn up the fader
Putting it down for the streets regardless what you saying playa!
How many times am I gunna have to tell y'all?
Flipmode run these streets, c'mon!

[Hook - 2: Mynx] {*Busta Rhymes ad-libs*}
I wish I - I wish I had just a little more time (more time)
Instead I give you this and leave more on your mind (on your mind)
Me and Busta Bus be making crazy doe (crazy doe)
So you know that we be killing it fa' sho
Time goes by, in your life
And we're still here together
I will be here just to hold you down
We'll still be around
Cause we will rock forever

[Verse: Rah Digga]
Dirty reppin' the Squad, don't even get me started
Getting worldwide love keeping the street regardless
Ever since kindergarten, always been the sharpest
Doin' this for my fam cause home is where the heart is
Other crews could chill, all of y'all days are numbered
Bus got the Yellow Digga coming in the Navy Hummer
Start quality, guess I should thank my mother
"Bionic Woman" on the mic like I was Jamie Sommers
Now, I know that you don't wanna really take it there
Digga and Bus you know we make the perfect pair
We keep it gully wit a little latin flare, it's unfair
Oh well, how I still be spitting and keep everybody all up in the mix
It's only right that I shout my brother Swizz
Flipmode and we only making hits
It's like this, c'mon

[Bridge]
[Mynx:] Baby I say, what people say
We gon' keep it on lock from day to day
Let 'em know that we both are here to stay
So keep it hot baby, don't stop baby

While I'm on a yacht, overseas, doin' my nails

[Verse 3: Rah Digga]
Now he sittin' there lookin' stuck

If money ain't a thing, I'm sayin' let a bitch know

Now he hopin' on the jet, he ain't wastin' no time
Told me all expense paid anyplace I could find

I know it feels like I been gone for a minute
But I'm back, chinchilla ice on with a fitted
Everybody talk money, everybody gone with it
With that bowl of bread smaller than the arm of a midget (TURN IT UP!!)
And you know I'm doin' my thing, it's blue in the ring
If you had it like this, you probably do it the same
But you won't, cause you broke, all you do is complain

Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it
Turn it, leave it, stop, format it

[Verse 6: Papoose]
Five boroughs of death, you don't understand

Now I could make a tight fist and let it crumble ridiculous
Or I could smack the world with a New York Nemesis (TURN IT UP!!)
I got Staten Island on my pinky, Queens on my thumb, dude
The Bronx on my middle finger screamin' fuck you
Rock ice in Manhattan so there's the ring finger
You know I had to keep Brooklyn on the trigger finger

Full gear, Spookier. Aah Aah Aah!
I'm 'bout to scream at the top of my lungs
And I don't even know why
I'm screaming. Aah Aah Aah!
And I'm screamin' on the
Wrong part of the song
Bus, you did it again, lets turn it up more
Let's turn it up loud
Let 'em know we ain't playin'
And I don't even know
What the chorus is sayin'
(Touch It, Bring It, Babe)
Just give me the beat Bus, plus

Live nigga bully foot brassed up on rap shit now
Check it out now

VERSE 1:
Yeah, yeah, yeah re-lax that shit you talk
Before I sick my bitch on you that'll bounce with your dick on a fork
I'll bring a bigger storm to calm your clouds
I own a couple things; I even own a farm with cows
I own the moment when my niggas run deep through crowds
Like how a pregnant woman breast milk leek through her blouse
A lot of niggas like to wish on a star
Don't give a fuck who you are
I know some niggas that'll piss on your car
Now see, every time we step in a place
I give y'all niggas shit that put a foul look on your face
And rob ice like I was never more able
Don't drink coffee 'cos my diamond be cutting the glass on the table
Hey, I be the lost found tribe of "Jabas"
Bust niggas then I plant another bomb in your ass
And then I put my students all in a class
To clear my ruler ship
And make y'all niggas fucked up doin' the math

HOOK:
One time now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Turn my music up (C'MON)
Turn my music up (UHH)

CHORUS:
I know ya-wanna-get up-on it
Let me-show ya- how we do
Every-time we-drop that-shit you
Know we-put it-down for you (HEY, HEY)

VERSE 2:
How many times you gon' crush down somethin'
You need to change your name up, to Bus-A-Bus down somethin'
You fuckin' with the highest my nigga
Tryin' to fuck with the giants, might as well call me Goliath my nigga
C'mon, drop hot shit on the spot; sop it up with a mop
Before the hungry come and shop on your block
I know some niggas that'd love to blood suck you all
A thing of the past, because them niggas stuck you all
One shot bustin' the same bullet, struck you all
And when they bounce you hear voices screamin' "FUCK YOU ALL"
Gathered up about a thousand young ?box? who brawl
As decoys, in case they needed to duck you all
That's why you better move tight with your click
Niggas be thirsty and quick
Just to be off into the night with your shit
C'MON, we keep it street to give a damn who you are
Make niggas wile, and bitches spread, and put they hands on the car
Now let me frisk 'em, and shake they asses down to the floor
One dude wonderin', "What them niggas is poundin' me for?
What them niggas grillin'? What them niggas houndin' me for?"
Before the poundin', "What them niggas was surroundin' me for?"
Well let me tell you what the fuck we was surroundin' you for
We came to get you once but now I come to get you for more
And while they get and got, niggas drinkin' ten-dollar-henne a shot
Getting' drunk and wilin' out in the spot

HOOK:
What the fuck now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Turn my music up (C'MON)
Turn my music up (UHH)
Hot shit now (C'MON)
Street shit now (C'MON)
Truck volume (C'MON)

CHORUS x 2



[Intro: Busta Rhymes + (Redman)]
(Barking) Yeah (Turn me up some)
Fuck goin' on; yo Uncle Darren, what up brother
Yeah, yeah
Flipmode!
See we got a whole...
We got a gift-wrapped package for you motherfuckers
Yeah, yo, yo, yo, yeah
Bust it

[Verse 1]
I stay rippin' a nigga tracks so
Hotter than wax, yo, so tell me why you act so
Yo, I max 'cause I make a nigga black 'til its time to relax yo
Until you all collapse so, fuck it
It's hardly that the god is getting tired
You don't wanna say that
Can catch a cardiac relapse, nigga
What, the god is back so you don't want nuthin'
No matter how you react
Blows that black and blue your front and your back
Choose, whatever the route that you choose
Wounds so horrendous forensics will get to analyzing the bruise
Blows will never come in singular, they coming in twos
My crew be starting the ruckus once I give them the cues
To blast from the triggers that'll bust from all of my dudes
Be the shit that make you niggas run up out of your shoes
We make you back down, having the facts down
With all the noise you be making you can even see the shit on the news
Word up

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes + (Redman)]
So you don't know nuthin' about it
(Barking...Turn me up some)
Yo, the heat from of the street will burn you up some
Yo, the shit I'm sure to spit will hurt you up some
I'm sayin'
But you don't know nuthin' about it
(Barking...Turn me up some)
Yo, I drink a fifth of yack and hurl it up some
Yo, just bang it in the truck and turn it up some
I'm sayin'...

[Verse 2]
Now watch me get a nigga fast, like them bitches with no ass
You corny niggas low class
Yo, I flash on them then I go and smash
Couple hoes and then splash on them
Flicking a little ash on them
From the blunt we smoking, keep a chick choking
Got them open with flows
I suppose it make them soak in their clothes
Keep the shit that make 'em sniff and make em open they nose
Got them fucked up, stuck just like they striking a pose
Yo, we gaining weight, nah, it's just my pockets are swole
From keeping niggas whylin' while they driving smacking the pole
Ah, one, two, yeah, see, perhaps, while I hold me a stack
Hater niggas block, holding me back
Yo, you fool niggas plotting against the god best be holding a strap
'Cause how we coming through, you know it's a wrap
Move with a crew of guerrilla dudes who know when to clap
I blow some shit from off of the Earth or the face of the map
Yo, so take that
Once we give it to you, ain't no faking a jack
It's funny how you find your face in a trap
Little bitch nigga fronting like he ready to scrap
You better off acting pussy trying to give me a dap
Staying focused on fulfilling a dream
The way we spark up and spit a fire, the flame probably killing your team
Fuck it, so now we harbor helicopters, turn this shit up
If you and your peoples ain't hearing me proper
I'm sayin...

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes + (Redman)]
So you don't know nuthin' about it
(Barking...Turn me up some)
Yo, the heat from of the street will burn you up some
Yo, the shit I'm sure to spit will hurt you up some
I'm sayin'
But you don't know nuthin' about it
(Barking...Turn me up some)
Yo, I drink a fifth of yack and hurl it up some
Yo, just bang it in the truck and turn it up some
I'm sayin'...



Aiyyo Mega' gimme some of that barefoot jungle shit
And let me shake a leg nigga! (Megahertz)

Let's give it to 'em
Yo, let's give it to 'em
Yo, let's give it to 'em
Busta Bust, let's give it to 'em
Flipmode, let's give it to 'em

[Verse One]
Ever felt the fire burn like this (burn like this)
You shocked that I've returned like this

And earl like knowin I'm bonin your girl like this

Stack peso, big money know my small money
Probably bigger than your WHACK payroll

Hollerin and screamin this my shit! (RRAH!)
Count that in the amounts that amount to the ceiling
I know you love the way we bounce back nigga
Gimme my ounce back nigga, Flipmode back in the spot
You can run and go announce that nigga, c'mon

[Hook]

Get your big ass on the floor
You know we goin'..



(Busta Rhymes)
Yeah I though all y'all was goin'
Uh, Yeah, yeah, yeah

You mean now, now, now, yeah
We gonna sail in one of them big fat ocean liners on the street
Swim through this mutha fucka
Busta-Bus now, now, now

(Busta Rhymes)
Hop scotch I found a new bounce
Just rock back and fourth while my beat knock (Aurgh!)
Stop chips and cock Glocks wit' clips
Go sailing in hot ships and park big whips (oh!)
Getting' them whips and bounce outta town
Take trips ride slow through them hoods and park at the main strip
Baby girl gimme yo hand cock fast (c'mon!)
With a number in your hand, hot ass (hold up!)
Shorty actin' just like she had a hit (on me!)
Fuckin' while shorty's busy shakin' her shit (on me!)
Man stop, just let 'em flop watch girlfriend let alone cock block
Hot shit make a bitch wanna whine just like a reggae tune
Make y'all niggas wanna act and bust the AK boom!
Everyday create a may lay today is pay day mutha fucka you better make way!

(Hook)
It's your night go get your money
Get that dough bounce if ya want
And light that blunt smoke if you got to
Shake yo shit bounce if you have to
Flimode squad back in the spot

Yes yes y'all bounce we go what ya want

All my niggas, all my niggas
All my bitches!
C'mon!

(Busta Rhymes)
We stay spittin' on
See what we sittin on
Shittin' you see how my 20" be fittin' on nigga
A 100 dollar bill shorty number was written on
Hittin' shorty on the sink wit' the lights in the kitchen on
C'mon! move quiet with all the DL chicks
Who carry on Lincoln head up on my CL 6
Hit y'all wit' the shit split y'all
Chicks all on my whip hoping ya ass fit y'all
We suppose to reach most shit bang
Watch how niggas bounce in East Coast (Heaighh!)
Choke y'all provoke y'all
Killin' street everytime we distribute the coke all
Check it, see now a days we caught cribs
And caught big fat loss
Fuck big fat bitches that make cliques back off
The way we prove it to y'all
Is just bang niggas every time we do it to y'all

(Hook)

(Busta Rhymes)
Yeah
Straight black out shit fo show
Making you back yo mack out quick Aiyo (huh)

We puts it on and watch bitches getting' a getsy
Flimode up in this mutha fucka just for the record

(Hook)



{*harmonized ad libbing for 12 seconds*}

[Hook: DeMarco & Jelly Roll]
The way I rep the street and how a nigga killin every single second
They say I'm doin too muuuuuuuch
I try to step back just a little just to give niggas a chance
But as you've seen they really couldn't do muuuuuuuch
Even when I'm layin low I put it down for every city and every borough
I love to put the hood uuuuuuup
I disappear just for a minute and it's funny when the same people say
We hate the fact that you gone - SO NOW THE HOOD BE SAYIN!!
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh, we miss you, oh and we love what you doin sayin {*3X*}
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh, we miss youuuuu, ahh-ahh-ahh

[Busta Rhymes]
Jack, lemme, lemme show you niggas progress
Layin the law like I'm the head of Congress
Jewelry layin like a baby on they mom's breast
GUESS WHAT~?! I'm 'bout to drop another bomb - YES!! YES!!
Back with the crack, fiends get in line
Feds patrollin the strip, see it's election time
Mr. Rhymes thirsty to lock up every town bagged
Money heavy like we carryin babies in them brown bags
Like my brown Louis luggage, I'm in a brown suit
A rare Louis collection, pushin a brown Coupe
Paint job sick like a bitch leakin out brown douche
Hundred EX Phantom, suck in the brown pew
Banned, cigar man now look around you
People gather like they done finally found the truth
Every word so compellin; I'm burnin down the booth
Now if you niggas need proof LISTEN!!

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Check - all rise, niggas get it straight (ha)
I rep the hood, rain hail snow and earthquake (ha)
I'm past rattlin buildings, I make the earth shake (OH!)
And make the hood wanna rebel and start to hurt Jake (Jake)
Like how the pavement lay on every street
I turn savage and grow fangs when I'm on every beat
There's never been any problem! We harbor heavy heat
You niggas know that he got 'em, so listen when he speak
Go 'head niggas! Peep how I'm rollin up my sleeves on 'em
Boa constrictor flow I'm 'bout to put the squeeze on 'em
My money speak a different language, Lebonese on 'em
And turn it up another two thousand degrees on 'em
GET 'EM~! I dress bummy in Bugati, stupid
And drown cities when I give you that tsunami music
And watch my HOOD niggas spaz, peep the way I do it
Long as you know who be the greatest DON'T CONFUSE IT

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yah!! Busta Rhymes, come fi take over
Yah!! Watch you dance, or you a lead
Yah!! C'mon go... yah!! Aight... {*fades*}



[Hook: Ron Browz]
If two dollars gettin made, we want in
If a stock is gettin trade, we want in
A record gettin played, we want in
A message to the game, that we want in
Whoaaaaaaohhh, we want in
Whoaaaaaaohhh, this is a fair warning
Whoaaaaaaohhh, we want in
Whoaaaaaaohhh, this is a fair warning

[Busta Rhymes]
Ha, hey ma! Look your child's grown
And I built somethin, Flipmode is touchin down stone
Look you shouldn't have no fear
And now we bringin the streets back, look how it feel out here
Now y'all respect the hard work, but I don't care nigga
We all tryin to eat you better learn how to share
You see the moral of the story and from how it begins
Is I'm extortin this whole shit - nigga I want in~!

[Hook]

[Spliff Star]
Open up the blood clat door let me in
Before I let the barrel spin and fire off the pin
This is my block (block) this is my shop (shop)
Fuck a ex-cuse, give me mines off the top
What'chu waitin on? All my patience is gone
I ain't waitin on no man, I stick to the program
Keep the pockets bulky like the muscles on Conan, swollen
European cars I be rollin - Spliff!

[Hook]

[Show Money]
Geah niggas, this is your fair warning
I give one soo woo to the gang and they on it (soo woo)
Cause you know how I think, drugs and extortion
We tired of waitin nigga we want our portion
You know what we endorsin, more violence and more fortune
Watch how you play with them boys - use caution
It's {Money Roll} geah
And that whole motherfuckin Flipmode, don't cross them

[Hook]



[Hook: Busta - singing]
Branded... scorned is the one who raaaan
What do you do when your branded? And you know you're a man
Wherever you go, for the rest of your life
You must proooooove, you're a man

[Verse 1: Busta]
See now I'm back wit the force, read about the kid
From the front to the back of The Source
You see me back on the course
Scream on every beat untill my voice get crackled and horse
Front seat niggas never sit in the back wit a boss
Fuck the fact that it cost, the pricetag of the porche
Will cost ya life, have ya motha feel an immaculate loss
*Breath* But of course, come and speak to the best
And watch me spit a jewel sharper to carve the meat of your flesh
You lookin weak in the chest, you see the street is a test
Women on the stoop smokin holdin a seed to they breast
You see the street is a mess
Strugglin holdin a couple pounds of weed then the rest
Now I proceed to the rest of my niggas Keepin it fresh
Though we must stay on the grind I supersceded the stress
We always seem to finesse from the East to the West
You Know we w-w-we keep the teflon from the street to the vest
Kill that nigga slow like how you get defeated in chess
Got you under pressure--hairline receaded effects
Hot air niggas I only feel the heat from your breath
Rap niggas beef in they album probably needed the press
And as a man I never found the slightest need to impress
Another man because I'm proud and I believe that I'm blessed
But yo I always found the need to adress these weaker niggas
That speak to the street always keepin the people abreast
Now you've been branded...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Busta]
Higher science and I'm changin the crime in
Watch my son cuz you'd be fuckin wit the child of a Giant
Im in a place stuck between bein lovin and violent, *voice switch*
Becomin more of a threat when I move subtle and silent
Then set it off to be the only one to quiet the riot
My destiny's the only thing between the sky and the pilot
Relate, it's like bustin a 3-8
Be late, I be takin most of the brick leavin a pile outta shape
I never quit watchin these niggas try to hide they mistake
Takin a shit watchin they body floatin by in the lake
Make it quick you weak niggas better try to escape
And create the quickest way to reach the fire escape
Snitch niggas always quick to go and lie on a tape
But it's o-k cuz Super Hero niggas die wit a cape
It's so great to watch them finally break, stand aside from the fake
Street niggas gotta slide for the take//
Bein broke and not bein able to buy me a steak
Stackin my paper so see now I can buy an estate
So I rely on the love and I reply to the hate
So much pain in the struggle my whole body'll ache...come on...
From the gates, so awake that was the plan of my fate
Now I'm straight...got me my OWN knife and fork on my plate
Wanna scorch a debate, wait...do me a favor nigga jus REMEMBER
The date...cuz you been...

[Hook]



Yeah.. Flipmode.. Violator..
Neptunes nigga
What you want nigga, yeah
What you want bitches
Keep it goin, c'mon

[Verse 1]
C'mon - who be the father to this?
Bounce right here niggas be followin this
Modelin bitches be frontin and be swallowin this
Carry on and yellin, screamin, be hollerin this
Flipmode co-signed to be the sponsor for this
What? To conquer this you need to march on for this
What? Ha, bitches just shake it and wiggle
And start to bake and just giggle
And then get naked a little and shit
Sweat drippin off they face and they nipple and shit
Niggas wildin til they be all tired and crippled and shit
Yeah you buggin on how we be doin it to ya
Hit y'all niggas with shit just like bullets was travelin through ya
Now, from right to left with a capital F
So we gon' keep this shit hot to death and we stoppin your breath
Drinkin and buggin and fuckin with them hoes again
But it's nothin cuz y'all niggas KNOW we 'bout to blow again

[Verse 3]

Go 'head and crash your whip in the fuckin wall
It's cool, niggas.. we gets busy

[Verse One]
Fo' sho', spit rogue, get mo' bout to kick in the door
Dick sore, split whores 'til they shit on the floor
Clique more sick from when you use to see us before
Shit, kill a nigga quick, niggas know my rapport
Keep workers on the strip that be ready for war
Brick I flip a little quicker if they shit in the store
Rip, maybe 'til they drop, and they shit in they drawers
Shit crazy when I pop, and I'm grippin the four
Thick bitches in the spot, watch 'em strip for the sport
Spit vicious for the block, yeah we swingin a torch
Stick niggas for they shit, thank 'em for they support
Quick nigga, better quit snitchin down at the court
Check track a little slick and try to go on my Forbes
Cause we stackin like we rich, and we holdin the fort
This time, we had to bring it, guess what we brought
The hottest shit to bang from L.A. to the streets of New York

[Hook]
All my people, get drunk, get high - WHATTUP?
Get money, get rich, get fly - WHATTUP?
Get stupid, get busy, get live - WHATTUP?
Jump all in your whip, turn the key and drive - WHATTUP?
Make a mill' yeah we gon' make about five - WHATTUP?
We speak the truth and we ain't talkin no jive - WHATTUP?
I'm speakin to the streets and everybody's widdit - WHATTUP?
Once again you know we only come to get it - WHATTUP?

[Verse Two]
AOWWWWWWW!! Ha, I stay wicked now I'm back on the strip
Like I went on a vacation and I'm back from my trip
Nuff radio rotation like I'm sailin a ship
Or when the team circle the block, busy trailin my clique
Truck packed fulla niggas with the strap and the whip
Get the gat out of the stash, put it back on my hip
Gat butt you in the face, split and fatten your lip
Blood hit the floor louder than the clap when it drip
I credit your name with bullets, read the back of the script
My victim's initials engraved on the back of the clip
Chicks love the way we roll, how the movement is thick
So official like my name's on the back of your bitch
Pay triple for the name on the back of the stitch
Name like the whole city now I'm changin the pitch
Kick back kinda crazy when I'm holdin the fifth
Think you nicer than the God, shit is only a myth
Grab ahold of the masses, I was born with a gift
Niggas be runnin they trap, throw 'em over the cliff
Thinkin and drinkin the Guinness, busy holdin the spliff
Flippin and shittin on niggas 'til we old and we stiff
I don't even drive whips, throw the shit on the lift
12 hours, one worker do the whole of the shift
I do the thing to make you open your mouth
And give you shit to bang the Midwest and the rest of the South

[Hook]



[Verse One]
I hope you ready to march niggas
Hup two three four
Back with the gangsta of rap, retort
I hope somebody quickly call up a doctor go get a medic
Cause somebody 'bout get it, find the nearest exit
Oh shit nigga
Goin' insane muthafucka
'Bout to rupture ya cell membrane shit
The propane bitch

Type of shit that ya can't contain
I fill'em with octane
Light another fire nigga
'Til I'm high killa
Ignite another flame
Ah sorry I dig his talent well tie ya little lame, look
Okay, it don't matter cause I'm the one to blame

[Hook]
Ooh, ooh and I like it, I like it

The fire gon' burn, I'm shifting the climate, quiet
And if you wan' test what I'm on bitch

I mentioned that I'm back to cause the riot (got drugs)
And I come to supply it
Hu, hu you niggas on a diet
You can't stop it
When I drop, ya know, ya can't deny it
My home, boy, you know that I'm a cook and I'mma fry it
While I'm counting this money and I hide it
I'm taking it back puttin' ya hands where my eyes can see
You get to puttin' yo eyes on me
Look how I drop shit

Everybody gather around and get ya to singin' the hook

Yeah, wife in law, my bitch for the triflin' whore
Type of bitch to make a nigga get the right things for
Bitch sexy, and beautiful, and gangsta, and golden
Love to fuck a nigga till the pussy dry and swollen
My lil' bitch had a figure like a wine glass
Slim bitch stackin like a muhfucker with a fine ass
Word to mother; bitch nasty like me
Love to fuck a nigga in places where people could see
The bitch send a chill like cold freezin a nigga
The way she holdin and bitin and suckin and squeezin a nigga
Down and dirty bitch never dick teasin a nigga
Got her own paper and focused on pleasin a nigga
She ain't out for gettin a nigga or fuckin my life
She only wanna fuck a nigga while he fuckin his wife
There was nuttin she couldn't achieve
In the mornin bitch was across the street waitin for wifey to leave
Called me on the cell while the wife was runnin a bath
She can't wait for me to fuck her, till I cum in her ass
Just a long-time chick I used to fuck from the past
She love to out-fuck a nigga, see how long I could last
It be nice the way she always let me dig in her rib
The bitch fuck a nigga like she wanna move in my crib
Bitch I always knew ya ass was a star
In the daytime, whippin the droptop, givin me head in my car

[Hook - Jaheim]
When a woman needs love, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin that you don't
Cuz she will fool around, just like you do
Ohh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin that she won't

[Busta Rhymes]
C'mere bitch and place ya pussy right where it belong
And put me in the mood to fuck just like a Jodeci song
I love the little freaky shit you be approachin me on
Dick all in ya mouth, you know what type of shit I be on
The way the pussy lock feel like we about to be stuck
All outside busy, givin me the balcony fuck
Hold on get up off of me quick
Bitch grab the X.O. and suck the Hennessey up off of my dick
So quick, so fast, bitch'll come out her skirt
Fuck a nigga till it hurt, while the wifey at work
The bitch'll even call her girl so I can fuck with her friend
And fall asleep to wake up and start fuckin again
Straigh nasty little bitch no horsin around
The bitch even want me to fuck her when she walkin around
Hold up, it's kinda ill how we be workin the caper
She ain't only good for pussy, she be givin me paper
Wife-in-law, my bitch be always keepin it raw
Always slidin out before the wifey walk in the door
They way she fuck me on straight for the night
Wifey still ain't make it home, I wonder if she workin late for tonight
Wifey actin funny style but I ain't fuckin with that
She ain't call the crib so I wonder where wifey was at
Hmmm.. shit kinda had me buggin before
But now I laugh because wifey had a husband-in-law

[Hook] 2x

Heh... Heh...



[Busta Rhymes]
Look, it's been a long time, I shouldn'ta left you
But now I came back to step through
Think of how many weak dudes you heard boo
Time's up, sorry I let you
Listen to them, you see I'm back with a gem
And you knowin that I'mma always keep it hot 'til the end
And again and again, that's how we

[Estelle]
Make the world go round
Round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah go round

[Busta Rhymes]
Ay, AY! Just feel my presence
Better than ever, back with a vengeance
Ah hey, slide on baby just ride on
I give ya, e'rything people rely on
My nigga, the heat that meat gets fried on
Still'll, drop shit to murder the club
Call it a killa, stand up with my back on the wall
And let her throw her ass, that's what a thug do
Put it down, rep how we rep, niggas know we ball
If you ain't know we bought out the club too
Baby girl get it - let's swing it
Right back to the crib then I hit it, she love the way I spit it
Huh! See when I come they love how I'm movin it
They worship the kid and the way I'm really doin it
Shit, make baby girl moist
I'm steppin in the club, valet the Rolls Royce

[Hook: Estelle]
Filthy talkin, bottle poppin
Disco rockin, park, go party
I feel life, money and Cashmere
These things, make the world go round
Round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah go round

[Busta Rhymes]
Now what the hell are you lookin for?
Watch how a nigga bring the ceilin to the floor
See the way I do and get a little raw now
Break somethin, see the way we kickin in the door now
When I come see a Range and a Porsche now
Do what I say, women to the floor now
More is what I'm comin to get
World tours now, nigga charter the jet
Got, women sweatin and they ready and they willin I
Come to the telly and they steady doin the diddy bop
Hit you with it, sh-sh-sh-sh-shorty gettin really hot
Pretty with it, the way a bitch can make the city stop
Whyle all night, mami know the routine
Style so right - and I'm creatin a new scene
Bass seem to make mami come and put it on ya
While I give it to ya cause you know I'm back to DO IT for ya!

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
And away we go - off to the next spot
First 5 is a little club kinda hot
First on the scene, see the blunt fire spark
Snatch shorty, take her to the corner where it's dark
Now, shorty breathin all heavy, hands all on me
Then she turn around and try to put her ass on me
I ain't payin no mind
'til I seen her crew waitin on the Soul Train line
Now, shorty workin hard tryin to get with me
Wanna take me to the bathroom tryin to give me quickie
But - I ain't trickin on 'em like my name Tricky
When they smell my cologne they wanna try to give me hickie
Like kissin and huggin and suckin on my wrist full of diamonds
Move slow, I'll tuck your little chick in my pocket
Type of shit I do all day
Like the last broad to the show stay, okay?

[Hook]



Yea.. aiyyo Uncle Pat, turn up the beat just a lil' more for me bruh
Yea.. {*imitating the beat*}
This sound like Frankenstein's baby, yea

[Verse One]
Busta Rhymes! You know we live and in color (color)
Shit butter hot, but just a little mo' gutter (gutter)
Smash shit regularly, word to my mother
Show love for the bitches and put it down for my brudda (brudda)
Hot butter funk make it rain, close the shutter - violate
Catch it from one of my bitches, boxcutter (cutter)
Ahh, articulate! Feels so great
That I can bless my niggas with shit they appreciate ('ciate)
No jive y'all niggas can take a nosedive
Shit so live bitches wanna give me a high five (five)
UNGHHH! Fuck it, it is a must we hold grands
Get with the program and fuck bitches who love to hold (hands)
Foul shit, way out of order
Fuck shit up leave bitches hot and sweaty drippin buckets of water (water)
Disorderly conduct, will erupt
When the live shit come on niggas do what they wanna (wanna)
Aight bitches, now show yo' asses

[Hook]
The shit we droppin be sure to get y'all movin (get the fuck up)
We keep it poppin, feel how gangsta the loop is (we keep it boppin)
(we keep it gangsta muh'fucka)
And it ain't no stoppin the way that we gon' do this
Now what you want me to say? Say you ain't fuckin with me-ahhhhhhh
(what the fuck, c'mon)

[Verse Two]
Huh, you see I got so much new hot shit stored
Got you givin me an award, floored a couple on the come up
Stretched a few, put 'em flat on they back
And laid 'em stiffer than a board, the way I make my niggas applaud
My price tag, just to show up the shit
Might be somethin you can't afford
Make you say the Lord is my shepherd, how we astonish
Move forward on novice niggas like Cedric Ceballos with a hot song
Now niggas know we rock on, cock-strong
All y'all niggas is straight popcorn, AHH!
Talk the trash, comin forth get past lie duke
Pass shorty with the big horse ass (ASS)
Now ain't no stoppin how we comin full blast
Mix the fire with gas, that's how we put it on smash (smash)
No lie, never deny - so hot we cook the shit well done
Just like a deep fish fry; UNNNGHH, snap crackle and pop
What we drop and how we keep shit comin
How we maneuver so fly (fly), so high is where we gon' take it
Controllin the land, controllin the sea
Now we control the whole sky; perhaps make niggas collapse
Make bitches shake they shit to the floor
And feel the soul up in my raps and your face is the gutter we slap
Make you crash all in your whip when you drive
I hope your seatbelt's strapped, aight niggas! Now throw yo' hands up..

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, this sound like.. the music to Frankenberry or some shit
The fuckin.. groovy ghoulies and friends or somethin {*laughing*}



[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah
It's funny how the game change, right?
Hehe
Shit feel all different
Y'all niggas complainin' left and right about how the game feel all fucked up
Niggas only been talkin' like that since we been sittin' out the game, I think the game need us, Kamaal
Let's talk to them niggas
Huh!

[Verse 1: Q-Tip + Busta Rhymes]
So many nights were spent ponderin' (Ha)
Wonderin' how we gon' come again (Hmm)
My golden rule is not to focus on the fame game (Uh)
In retrospect (Ha), the game ain't the same, mane (The same mane)
Their heart and soul is divided (Ooh!)
They ramshack the music, no control up inside it
Now, look at this; it's all stretched out and nasty (Uh huh)
But—(What, what?) lettin' money pass me? (Wooh)
I doubt that, and niggas from the bottom know (Uh huh)
Pumpin' hard, wind, sleet, hail, rain, or snow (Uh huh)
So (So), you got to get your gate right (Right)
No matter what (Uh), you got to treat your weight right (C'mon, uh huh)
On the block if you focused on greed then (What, what?)
Nine out of ten times you be bleedin'
The analogy is clear to all of my peers
I'm a muh'fuckin' vet, don't mean to disrespect, 'cause I—

[Hook: Sample + Q-Tip + Chauncey Black + Busta Rhymes]
"I write rhymes, I write checks"

Ayo, what happened?

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, I ain't bringin' they names up (Wooh!)
These niggas sound trash, straight foulin' the game up (Ha)
Need to change up (Change up), sound so trash (Ooh)
When I see 'em feel like breakin' they frame up (Ha)
DuPont registry (Ha), talkin' 'bout somebody else cars (Ooh)
Muh'fuckers better step up your bars (Ha)
Instead of frontin' in the game like niggas really are stars
Like we ain't seein' through the bullshit, we know who you are (C'mon)
I'm like a blessing to the game when your shit sound dated
I force niggas to improve, you should be happy I made it (Ha)
Here to rep the game fully, change my style like the weather
Givin' you niggas new shit to make the game feel better
I'm sayin, I cook in the kitchen and we make the thoughts connect
You forced to humble yourself, give me my big respect (Ha)
You hurtin' the game when your shit sound off, yaknow
A legend in this shit that's why I move like a boss, yaknow (Ha)
You better be tight, 'cause you can get tossed, fo' sho' (Ha)
You niggas know whassup, I come correct with money long 'cause I—

[Hook: Sample + Busta Rhymes + Chauncey Black + Q-Tip]

Yup, these niggas in the game don't sound the same
Ayo, what happened?
They ain't got it in 'em to make a classic
Ayo, what happened?
These niggas can't hold the torch, so why pass it?
(Yo)

[Verse 3: Q-Tip + Busta Rhymes]
Oh, my God, they'll (Uh) come ridin' around
Some (Uh) old dream and they (Uh) can't get down
They (Uh) lookin' around outside of themselves
And they (Huh!) sayin' things that ain't really themselves
And they (Ha) keep fuckin' regurgitatin' the same script (Huh)
Same hoes, same blow, same Glock clip (Ha)
Same drug strip (Uh), what the fuck is this? (Uh)
C'mon, y'all, raise the bar on this body shit (Huh!)
You sound stagnant, need to progress and grow (Uh huh)
Upgrade your punchlines, finesse the flow (Uh huh)
Get your concepts and lyrics together, ayo (Uh huh)
Then drop the bomb shit to step up the pressure, y'know? (Huh!)
I'm tired of niggas complainin' how the game changed (Ha)
You niggas should step up your game, cause you sound strange (Ha)
That's why you ain't sellin' no records, check the SoundScan
(Uh huh)
In this rap shit I command respect, muh'fucker cause I—

[Hook: Sample + Busta Rhymes + Chauncey Black + Q-Tip]
"I write rhymes, I write checks"

Ayo, these niggas in the game don't sound the same
Yup, these niggas in the game don't sound the same

[Outro: Q-Tip + Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, these niggas in the game don't sound the same
Bust', these niggas in the game don't sound the same
Ayo, what happened?
They ain't got it in 'em to make a classic
Ayo, what happened?
These niggas can't hold the torch, so why pass it?

[Hook]
This is it, what
Luchini pouring from the sky
Let's get rich, what
The jiggy vines and sugar dimes
Can't quit, what
Now pop the cork and steam the Vega and get lit
What, what, what

[Geechi Suede]
Introducing phantom of the dark, walk through my heaven
With levitation from reefers, drenching divas in E7
Showboating with Rugers, flash vines, Belafonte vigor
Let's skate for what this worth as we confiscate your figures

[Sonny Cheeba]
Casanova Brown levitating jiggy in dashikis
A la hotta car, fifty-four, chasing diamond runners
Headed ice bound, the big chilla diamond convention
Harlem Buck Strut, freezing world heist, Hollywood
Madame Butterfly, let me in your house of pleasure
From the knuckle swat, shadowboxers catching black-eyed blues

[Geechi Suede]
I play the thief, what
Sensations at the Mardi Gras be screaming Chee-ba
Fulfilling pleasures in my castles, blow the smoke out
The Garcia Vega substitutes when the Dutch is gone
The Lo don't stop, give me shouts
It's the seasoned sautéers, soufflérs for swerving on corners
We magnets to moolah, living with Charlie's Angels on this
No smiling we're sliding, that gets you caught up in the octa
Or deaded for moving, it's just like that as we proceed

[Sonny Cheeba]
Saturday night special better take it light, you Jah Jah
You're a Capitan, quest to the coast of Key Largo
Wire the chain gang, keep your ears out for Roy Ayers
Sip the Fontainebleau, house of bamboo paradise

[Hook x2]

[Sonny Cheeba]
Fallen pharaohs courtesy of Black Caesar, the convincer
Silky days, satin nights, taking flight, Donald Goines
Sweet sensation Spanish flying with the lady Scarface
Bottoms up sunshine, Love Potion No. 9

[Geechi Suede]
And we hailing from the Magic City
Transcending Suede-a on your aura
Found 'chini in London, relaxation in Bora Bora
Got notion to bring it, sing it, never been my function
Stoning, robbing, we heisting merchandise and gunning
Love it, leave it, but bless the war chief for his bison
Get it, got it, the Lo will forever be nice and

[Sonny Cheeba]
Yeah, the Sonny Cheeba he be sipping Amaret-tah
The Geechie Grace, yes he be sipping Amaret-tah
We float the tri-state draped in the satin vines
This Coolie Hijack packed from the sugar shack
Then what we do after we sip the Amaret-tah
We start the Harlem River Quiver, dig it sweet daddy
Sharpen the crimson blade, High Sierra serenade
Anatomy for seduction be this ebony junction

[Geechi Suede]
As we exit the place with grace
Drizzy Amaret-tah, the bursting of clouds, it pours
Everything seems better on flats, with love we move
Only in the mist, it's Lo, it's life and we can't get enough of this

[Hook]

[Sonny Cheeba]
Yeah, the Sonny Cheeba he be sipping Amaret-tah
The Geechy Grace, yes he be sipping Amaret-tah
The Joe Chink he be sipping Amaret-tah
The Chaquita, yeah G be sippin Amaret-tah
We got Asti Spumante with Amaret-tah
And then my man Ill Will sip Amaret-tah
And then my man Cab in the sight sipping that
We slide through the Tri-State with the hi-hat
And then I float side-to-side in my Coolie High
And then I do something with this Spanish Fly, yeah
And then I float down south with the Boogie Flats
And then I slide up in between the ziggy butt-ocks
And all of that yeah



[Verse 1: Céline Dion]
No mountains too high, for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah
No rivers too wide, for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray

[Pre-Chorus]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see

[Chorus: Céline Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
I saw the teardrops, and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It doesn't have to be this way, let me show you a better day

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep up safe and warm
And I know we will survive

[Bridge]
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near
Don't you dare give up the fight
Just put your trust beyond the sky

[Chorus] [x2]



[Intro: Ubiquitous] (x2)
You heard about it but,  couldn't  believe it
That they would kill a man, just for breathin'
And you were thinking fat chance there's a reason
Until you hear the BLAT BLAT then you see it

[Verse 1: Ubiquitous]
Well okay now they thinking that the gunplay
Was just an isolated thing from the one place
I tell 'em hell naw keep a celly cell on
And follow Philando, Alton and Delrawn
Out in Dallas they were caught up in the onslaught
Had a couple cop ducking from the pop pop
Body drop it was looking like he on top
Then they killed that motherfucker with the bomb bot
Now we cooking up the beef and the grill hot
You ain't heard about the deal with the Chilcot
It's a jagged little pill and the pill caught
In your throat and you wonder when it will stop
Greenpeace on the beach for the whale watch
Innocent still sittin' in a cell block
Got you wishin' on a tail of the Hale-Bopp
Lookin' for the gold ticket in the mailbox
Got a broke down livin' in my locale
Killa city block business you ain't know about
Donald Trump on a ticket we don't know how
Everybody lined up hopin' that their vote count
Maybe for their kids sake, how do you dictate
The real winner when they runnin' in a fixed race
Either which way, whoever you pick paid off by the rich motherfuckers in a big way
Gridlock on the government of this day, and everybody in the senate on a sick day
Lawmakers all caught up in the red tape, I read about it and I'm feeling like a headcase
Now they sayin' that I might've made a mistake, and I probably shoulda put it on a mixtape
Instead I put it on my name is on a list tape
And if they kill me then my baby mama gets paid FUCK Y'ALL

[Hook]
We can pretend we don't see it like our lids, locked
Look the government is all caught up in grid, lock
Read about it and you wonder when will it, stop
Gotta get mine before I got caught up and get, got
Grid, lock
Look the government is all caught up in grid, lock
Read about it and you wonder when will it, stop
Gotta get mine before I get caught up and get, got

[Verse 2: Godemis]
Everybody so uneducated on the problem, I don't think I'll live to see the day that people solve it
Killin' unarmed individuals in cold blood, now if that ain't murder what the fuck am I to call it?
They don't even give a shit and everybody saw it, why would  they, when they running around lawless
Acting like a ghetto celebrity, when they floss it, worst kept secret everybody who lost it
What's the repercussion for puttin' bodies in coffins
When you got a family member running for office
Moving in the circle of real killers and bosses, who the one to lose and they never take any losses
Anybody be gone yes pardon me but your honor, I don't want to be conned, and I don't want to be conquered
I don't want to be caged, and I don't want to be master
I don't want to be instrumental in a disaster
Murdering them and after, gathering all the data
I can see what the media thinking don't really matter
People do what they gotta do to make a move up the ladder
Sticking whoever long as their pockets are getting fatter
Mama's are getting madder, daddy don't give a damn
If people are in the street dedicating the jam, I'm looking at mother nature hollering no ma'am
Killing the little piggy literally going ham
And the fat cats acting like they know best
Live a carefree life feeling no stress
Will they ever pay for it never know I guess
But they don't give a shit about a protest
I said the fat cats acting like they know best
Live a carefree life feeling no stress
Will they ever pay for it never know I guess
But they don't give a shit about a protest

[Hook]
We can pretend we don't see it like our lids, locked
Look the government is all caught up in grid, lock
Read about it and you wonder when will it, stop
Gotta get mine before I got caught up and get, got
Grid, lock
Look the government is all caught up in grid, lock
Read about it and you wonder when will it, stop
Gotta get mine before I get caught up and get, got

[Outro]
Grid, lock
Gotta get mine before I get caught up and- (Gunshots and screaming)



[Hook: Stevie Stone & Ubiquitous]
She told me that she new to the city
She got a couple friends, not many
Where the lime and the Sprite and the Henny?
Wanna smoke lil' mama? Got plenty like
Pick a strain, whatever you want you can get
Indica, Sativa, never rolling plain jane
I know some people if you wanna drive 50
We ain't gonna cop any cause lil' mama got plenty

[Verse 1: Ubiquitous]
So many strains, nothing but flame, puffing the dro
One for the brain, one for the body, one for the soul
Running with Strange, keeping the party under control
Up, up away flying, how far are we gonna go?
Smoke team in the building
Godemis, what the deal is?
Wrek and Nonms coming with Bernz, Felix we're filming
County boy got the liquor
Casa was on a fader
Stevie came with the greenery, mixing multiple flavors
Whatever you want, homie
Tell me when to say when
How 'bout you and your friends come get with me and my friends
And keep it real with me, girl, I don't want to pretend
Like this is a new thing, cause really this' what it's been like
(Yeah!)

[Hook: Stevie Stone & Ubiquitous]
She told me that she new to the city
She got a couple friends, not many
Where the lime and the Sprite and the Henny?
Wanna smoke lil' mama? Got plenty like..
Pick a strain, whatever you want you can get
Indica, Sativa, never rolling plain jane
I know some people if you wanna drive 50
We ain't gonna cop any cause lil' mama got plenty

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Over the top, coming and going
They ain't ho-ing, goody-goody pooty tang you ain't even knowing
Handle the biat, bad little biat
B, I ain't slangin' the D alright? You should do the D-I-Y
Well, leave it up to me, I'll try
Tight Levi's and knee-highs that leave us dry

Pass it around, we taking tokes in a cypher
Been smoking since I was 2, so that mean I'm a life-er
Nothing I'm saying's true, that don't mean I don't like her
I mean Mary Jane's cool, that don't mean I'm gonna wife her
But she told me

[Hook: Stevie Stone & Ubiquitous]
She told me that she new to the city
She got a couple friends, not many
Where the lime and the Sprite and the Henny?
Wanna smoke lil' mama? Got plenty like..
Pick a strain, whatever you want you can get
Indica, Sativa, never rolling plain jane
I know some people if you wanna drive 50
We ain't gonna cop any cause lil' mama got plenty

[Verse 3: Godemis]
Way too wavy, radio don't play me
I don't mind y'all praying but it ain't gon' save me
I was going crazy then I bounced right back
Now I'm porno hard and Y'all can sit on that
Tell that lil' bitch I got money, ain't nothing funny
And regardless of the internet rumors I'm not a dummy
She bust it over for money, me Godi without a penny
We blowing that Strange mullah, who knew I was getting plenty?
Got the Sprite in the Henny, a right to be holding semi-
Automatic weapons, if and you [?]
Said she new to the city, we helpin' her live it up
There really ain't nothing to it, just let her know when to duck like
Fuck!

[Hook: Stevie Stone & Ubiquitous]
She told me that she new to the city
She got a couple friends, not many
Where the lime and the Sprite and the Henny?
Wanna smoke lil' mama? Got plenty like..
Pick a strain, whatever you want you can get
Indica, Sativa, never rolling plain jane
I know some people if you wanna drive 50
We ain't gonna cop any cause lil' mama got plenty

[Intro]
Yep, igh! igh! igh!

[Verse]
I got suspended, ooohh you got suspended
For chiefin' a hunnid blunts, 14,400 minutes
Fans all in the stands, they hands for Mr. Bennett
That racket over the net, ooohh give me my tennis
Shoes, give me a minute, ooohh I can't be tardy
My class is already started, they told my mom I'm retarded
But that 10Day done in one night, Honda from a Hyundai
No tassel in the spring, but after summer I'm alumni
They took my nigga one night, and I was standing right there
An inch away from Heaven, a million songs from right here
A step away from South by, a swing away from Cali
A hook away from verses, I'm a dad away from rapping
So at the school they arrested him
Back seat, squad car, nestled in
Shouts to the bitch nigga Heselton
Wit' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'
Finna see the 10Day Pestilence
So far, so good, so special and
No stars, good jobs, or excellents
And I'm still so fucking non-echelon
Ooohh you got suspended, ooohh you not gon' finish
Ooohh you look familiar, ooohh you look like Kenneth
Damn they gon' resent it, ooohh you representin'
A class of bad kids, 14,400 minutes, ahhh!

[Outro]
IGH! IGH! IGH! IGH! IGH! IGH! IGH! IGH! (Ayy)

[Verse]
22 Offs...
I'm off the nog, I'm off the Loko
I'm off that local, I'm on that global
I often had dreams of being locked in my momma's Volvo
Watching the garage burn down, I'm off the codo
I'm off the top, I'm off some pot, I'm off Ciroc
I'm off a lot, they gave me 10 Days off
That's an awful lot, I was off campus, but the officer
Told the office, that he saw me from the parking lot
But it's all good, I'm off that
I'm just finna off his ass, off of the Ave while rocking all black
Dip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot
Just to make sure that I don't get caught
Buying hella bug spray, making sure I get off
They told me go on and rock it, I told them that it's lift off
How all my homies get caught, picked off by a dick cop
Why you allowing hiccups, why you just didn't slip off?
And now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square
Having a white cop beat me while he offers me squares
You gon' torture me yeah? Well that's awfully fair
All for nothing, tryna tweak me like you offering years
Bitch I ain't scared, I'm already here
Tell ya partners and ya friends, the next coffin is theirs
Guess what bitch, I'm from internal affairs
Looking for crooked cops, to tweak so I can offer 'em years
Have me tweaking, like I'm all full of fear... alright, I'm tweaking

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

[Outro]
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
Rain, rain don't go away







[Intro: Ha Ha Davis]
Come on, big fella, you drunk, big fella
Two sips and now you wanna trip, big fella
You not a drinker, I can see it all in your leg, big fella
You wobbly, big fella, you finna fall
Sit down, you drunk, big fella

[Chorus: Knox Fortune]
All night, I been drinking all night

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Everybody outside, everybody outside
When I pull up outside, all night, no
Everybody high five, everybody wanna smile
Everybody wanna lie, that's nice, no
Oh, now you wanna chill, oh, now you wanna build
Oh, now you got the bill, that's cool though
Oh, now you got the gas, oh, now you wanna laugh
Oh, now you need a cab, that's true though
All you do is talk, I ain't got shit to say
Can't no one get in my car, I don't even valet
Long discussions, oh, you my cousin?
No you wasn't, you just wanna ride
You just wanna talk about politics, Chicago shit and rocket ships
(You just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna)
Shut up! Start dancing, ho

[Chorus: Knox Fortune]
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You just went and spilt fries in the seat
It's fried on the seat, come ride on the seat, ay
Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat
Now she jog in the streets, say
I don't trust no one faking like a fan, asking for a pic
You should use your phone, call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money
So back up, back up, I need space
Now, I need you to slow down, it's not a race
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now
Shut up! Start dancing, ho

[Chorus: Knox Fortune]
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay

And we back, and we back, na, na, na

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
This ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh, igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
Y'all know wha' mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the Word
This is the sheep that ain't like what it herd
This is officially first
This is the third

[Hook: Kanye West]
This is the bom bom bom
Bom bom bom
Bom bom bom
Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
This is the bom bom bom
Bom bom bom
Bom bom bom
Music all we got, got, got
So we might as well give it all we got

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothing away
Cause at the end of the day

[Hook: Kanye West]
Music is all we got
Music is all we got
Isn't this all we got?
So we might as well give it all we got
Music is all we got
Music is all we got

[Outro: Kanye West + Chicago Children's Choir]
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it

We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it

[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Angels, na, na, na, na

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

[Hook: Saba]
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded

[Post-Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels
I got angels

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke

[Hook: Saba & Chance The Rapper]
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded
Wap the bam (na, na, na, na)
I got angels
(I got angels) I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded
Na, na, na, na

They was talking "woo woo, this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded

[Post-Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels
I got, I got angels

[Outro: Vocals]
Na, na
Na, na
I got, I got



[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
I speak of promised lands
Soil as soft as momma's hands
Running water, standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold
Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label
Pro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public
He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must’ve missed the come up, I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I made it through, made it through, made it through
And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you
You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming (Coming, coming, coming)
So are you ready?
Are you ready?

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign, BJ The Chicago Kid, Anderson .Paak, Raury, Nico Segal, Lolah Brown & Chance The Rapper (HaHa Davis)]
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?

[Verse 1]
Here’s a tab of acid for your ear
You’re the plastic, I’m the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan’s Lab is adamantly here
No assignments, book of rhyming and I’m drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I’m the don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I’m a kamikaze and I’m a kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non kamasutral
You niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling I’m a neutral
But I’ma let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor
Metamorphoses and I’ma fuckin animorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele & Danny Whorf
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hand’s son, breaking walls like Samson
But I’ma throw a tantrum 'til I’m on every Samsung
Sanyo and handheld and handgun
Please put ya lighter’s up 'til life is up and light it up
And slice a cut, the night is young, it’s nice enough
The nicest blunt, the nicest stuff
My niggas out here trapping a lot
I know you think you on, hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.4’s for 15, yeah my nigga, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies though, choking on a doobie though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled, remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man
Brrang dang to Lil' B and bang a-rang to Peter Pan
IGH! Nigga
I burned, I, I bu-, I bu-, I burned
I burned, I, I, I burned
Br-br-br, hahahah

[Hook]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells now, nigga
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells now, now now now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells now, IGH!
I burned too many brain cells down
Down down down down down

[Verse 2]
Light a joint, or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
Ain’t no questions hit it vividly and pass me
Don’t answer about your problems
Or your issues or your Ashleys
It’s a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite
Rims, Henny, and reminisce, nostalgia and M&M's
Cinnamon tone women and feminine’s getting intimate
All broads is frivolous, homies could get they dividends
Is he illiterate, literal syndicate
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger affiliate
Sick twisted prick, sick sadistic
Son of a biscuit, man fuck this shit
IGH! I burned too many brain cells down
I burned, I burned, hahah
I burned too many brain cells down
Burned too many brain cells down, sing it with me

[Hook]
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Burned too many brain cells down, no no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells now, nigga
I burned too many brain cells down
Burned too many brain cells down
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells now, fuck 'em
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
I burned too many brain cells down



[Intro]
If this is my last shh- my last shit
Uhh, it definitely be mad important
Ey man, that sound like a Prince song

[Hook]
Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth

[Verse 1]
Somebody pray for the god, oh lord
I wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit
Rappin' trappin' trippin' 'cid
And sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin
Shoulda died - yelling YOLO was a lie
And you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
You and I look just alike
And I'm afraid that this one right here
Might be last time that I write a song
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang
But I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ain’t tryna go out at all
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last chance joint gotta be a dance joint
From an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint
Old school for my own old man joint

[Hook]
Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken

Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth

[Bridge]
This part right here, right now
Right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car
I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit
I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit
I hope you love all of my shit (IGH)

[Verse 2]
Why toss my filter when she saving my life?
The same shit that kills us, always feels so right
That's why I pray to the dealer
God know who he be
Truth be told he juiced me
Introduced me to the lucy leaf
Oh oh oh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter
Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier
Lies, Levis on fire
Flyer on the wall I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night
In the sky I get higher, higher

[Hook]
Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth

[Bridge]
This part right here, right now
Right here, this part my shit

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!

[Chorus 1 (Extended): Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Okie dokie, alkie, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling "fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)

[Chorus 1 (Extended): Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, check mate, check me take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain dead, take a tug and then pass

[Bridge]
I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 3: Twista]
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter - juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the new principle, sometimes I'mma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'mma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 1 (Extended): Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse: D.R.A.M. & Elle Varner]
You are very special
You're special too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you
You are very special
You're special too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you



Intro: Slum Village & (Chance The Rapper)
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick (On the mic like it's a dick)
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit (The shit)
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
What's good good? And what's good evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And why's God's phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot
I got a lot off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
Ya kna wha mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you
Buck buck bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News!"
Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass

[Hook: Chance The Rapper & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Right? IGH
I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but
My hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe

[Bridge]
Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demons ass

[Verse 3: Saba]
Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block under arms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas
Hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us we tryna get lucky
Doper than Lucky
You're ending happy that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating shit come hot
But y'all still love me ugh
How father time a deadbeat
Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, IGH

[Hook: Chance The Rapper & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right

[Intro]
Ken: Well I should have you hooked up next week

Chance: It's all good or whatever, I can wait 'til my birthday. I uh-

Ken: No, no, no, no. I told ya, I know you need it now, so next week I promise you I'll have you hooked up, ok?

Chance: Oh, alright. I just wanted to say thank you for everything. For the computer, the T-Shirts, and all the other stuff

Ken: You know, Chance. Let me tell you something. You know, I could never be more proud of anything in my life, you know, than I am of you and what you've done. Chance, you have done remarkable and wondrous things, so you don't have to tell me thank you for anything. I'm supposed to do this, that stuff for you anyway, and ya know, just keep doing what you're doing. I am very, very proud of you. Just keep doing what you're doing, ok?

Chance: Thank you, love you

Ken: Alright, son. Love you too, take care

Chance: Bye bye
Thanks for coming guys

[Verse 1]
'Member sittin' in class the first time listening to Dilla
Everything's good
Rubbin' on yo chin, sippin gin, Margiela brand chinchilla
Everything's good
My manager backpack packed with packs of cigarillos
And some fruit snacks, And some killer's
Phone numbers on speed dial call them save monkey guerillas
Everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodbyes
I ain't really that bad at leaving
I ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin'
Runnin through purses even persons leave em hurtin' bleedin
I ain't really help the helpless
I used to be worse than worthless
Now I'm worth hooks and verses
I'm good like books in churches
Harolds and Hooks and Churches
Everything's Good
See my name when you google search it
Use a card when I make a purchase
Everything's Good
But I knew it was fly when I was just a caterpillar
That I'd make it even if I never make a milla,
When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'
And everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodnight, I ain't really that bad at sleepin
With bad bitches, put them aside, I used to be thirsty creeping
Now I'm out working evenings birthdays even Tuesdays Wednesdays Thursdays weekends, rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events
Damn it feel good to be a gangsta
And it feel good for me to thank you
Put money back in your bank account
Off of songs I barely could think up,
Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up
Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound
I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo
Thanks Justin, lending them pencils
Mr. Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto
The time I beat Chris on Nintendo
Nanana hey hey, good intro,
Remember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thriller
Remember the first time you heard this through and thought, "damn that's that nigga."
Everything's good

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Turn the radio up and we can have a good time
Got me feeling like J.J. on Good Times
Back when Thelma had that ass, off the fam good
My sister said she likes my raps cause it sounds good
Told me not to cut corners, use to cut quarters
Sitting in the room, on the phone, cooking up orders
Till my pops popped me off, that was family matters
Used to watch him in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams
Now I'm rollin', iPhone Stolen
Mama whip with 5 of my guys, 4 holdin'
Trying to live our lives like our lives are so golden
Got big shoes to fill like try go bowling
Til we strike out, we just hoping we don't strike out
4th quarter, how you gon go and take Mike out?
Summertime Chi, I had to pull the bike out
Riding getting nice cause it's nice out

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Let's land in the land where the Famo stay
Grind all day til the fam okay
It still warm my heart to hear my grandma pray
For the fam of my friends when my mans go away (x2)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Don't wake up, don't wake up, don't wake up too fast
Don't make up your mind, you should flake on that class
Sing all you want, just don't Drake on they ass
Shore you got drive, don't turn fake on they ass
Good morning, good raps, good morrow, good luck
Tonight you could blow, tomorrow you suck
Bizarro, my carro, I borrowed from Chuck
A new SLR and Ferrarro deluxe
No money for the meter when I'm parkin' em
Gassed than a bitch no car with him
Market him, tell him that he's buzzing like a game of operation with Parkinsons
Young kid rappers, kidnappers
Young whipper snapper that will whip past ya
Will get at you, come get at you
Wanna break ya off, Come Kit-Kat you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sulaiman]
Now the team work make the dream work
Go ahead and send an application if you need work
If it need hurt, then I'mma bring hurt
How you finna see the clouds if you never seen dirt
Now you finna play it loud, listen how it's goin down
Didn't know the name before bet you niggas know it now
Chi-City niggy, made a 50 out a penny
Got some titties at the cribby and the Savemoney with me and we going in
Going all out for them hoes again
Now I'm fin to bring the fucking flow and bend it back
And show it's more to this than rap
Love my parents for supporting cause they know I'm finna crack
Know my niggas got my back, got some niggas selling packs
But I'm tryin' to get em cheese so I can get em out the trap
Now my figures getting fat, a lot of hoes be tryin' to jack
But I got her on my lap, All she do is make it clap

[Hook x 4]



[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Dang, dang, dang - skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal
He looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bob that back
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Young Rascal Flatts - young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds
Sang a song, oh you don't know? What?
Well, I still bang with you
Hang with you, sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like:

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bob that back

This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Niggas please be focused - that Bino, you know this
He rep the home of Sosas, you know I'm from that Zone 6
You know I rep that Stone shit, you know your hood is so clit
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit
I'mma be that - CG busy gettin', where the weed at?
Bought your girl some new kneepads
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
My stars, egad, she said: "this my favorite song"
"Hold my purse" - now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Your mom won't play it in the car 'cause it's got cursing in it
Your boy like: "I'm the one who showed you," he want his percentage
'Cause you were like: "this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it?"
Two-step - white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughing?
'Cause you Harlem Shake
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap, we killed the track
You had your chance, and 'Bino too

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Childish Gambino]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bob that back
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
And we back, and we back, and we back

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
They ain't teaching taxes in school
It don't even matter, I was acting a fool
But who would think the raps would turn into racks?
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you
Scars on my head, I'm the boy who lived
The boy love playing when the boy too sick
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help
I've been lying to my body can't rely on myself oh no
Last year got addicted to Xans
Started forgetting my name and started missing my chance
L.A. for four months, end up leaving right back
I'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat
I felt hogtied ever since my dog died
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride
I know he up there he just sit and he wait
I'll be racing up the stairs I'mma get to the gate singing

[Bridge: Eryn Allen Kane]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

[Hook: T-Pain]
Oh! All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Oh I'm gonna finish mine, yeah
All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Gonna finish mine, yeah-eah

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Hey! Gimme the water, gimme the water, I need the kind from Space Jam
Get this money, get this budget, KOK to day camp
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
I've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends
I got to pray I got to pray, like Hammer after “2 Legit”
I got the power I could poke Lucifer with crucifix
I cannot scrap the stupid shit, I stand up like I'm Ludacris
I know some folks that talk so much you'd think they drive an Uber whip
Damn, queen said, "Why we in a queen bed?"
I said, "It's yours, don't worry little bean head"
I'm just here to catch my breath, I got a world tattoo
She said, "Cool, just bring me some food"

[Hook: T-Pain]
Oh! All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Oh I'm gonna finish mine, yeah
All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Gonna finish mine, yeah-eah

[Bridge: Eryn Allen Kane]

Part 2: Drown

[Intro: Eryn Allen Kane]
The water may be deeper than it's ever been

[Verse 1: Noname]
Lord rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers, so when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away, to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She likes her Jesus mountain high
So He can watch her lonely child, I know my God
I know my God seen His breaks and His edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days He prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love

[Chorus: Choir]
Never, never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown

[Verse 2: Choir & Kirk Franklin]
Never, never, never! (Chance, let me in, come onin)
This thirst in my soul (There's a thirst in my soul, it tell me)
Where else can I go? (where?) But you (come on)
I may cry a river (I may cry a thousand tears)
But you take each drop and you wash (you wash me new)
Me new (people sing)
This water is deep (yes, yes and I need you to)
Jesus rescue me (come on, save me, I need you to)
Take me to your mountain (hallelujah)
So someday Chicago will be free (someday we'll all be free)
Be free (say!)

[Chorus: Choir]
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown

Nigga, fuck this whole school and everything you tahm 'bout
Don't ask me for no I.D., bitch I fucking signed out
Bitch I've been suspended, bitch I've been on timeout
Waking up in grind mode and sleeping in a grindhouse
So please don't hit my line 'bout the party trying to find out
What time that shit going to start
Or when it end, or who gone come out
Or if I walked the stage
I've been on stage since I could rhyme out
Shows and shows and tapes
Of trying to get my fucking lines out
So please don't take my BIC out, my book out, my pick out
My hair, my fucking big mouth, you dick head you dipped out
Of class and now you shit out of luck, who fucking slick now
And with them rhymes you written down
I hope you get a mix down
With a diss track from Ms. Rownd
And my dick sack in this bitch mouth
Give a five-hive to my teacher face
And my principal that fist pound

Dude yo' ass been drinking? Or you just wasn't thinking?
I'll hit you with that 6-piece: bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink!
I hear you're pockets jingling
It's calling me like "ring, ring!"
I'll choke you with your bling bling
Then run faster than Tink Tink
And all these goofies mad though
Like, "Why he such a asshole?"
And I ain't even mad yo, I'll stab you with a screwdriver
That shit ain't even rhyme nigga
I'm fucked up out my mind nigga
I stay right off the '9 nigga
That's where they try an' find a nigga
Feeling froggy? Better timid up
Harsh feelings gone, put 'em in a blunt
Cause niggas don't wanna get bended up
Stay talking but don’t send it up
Used to send it up for my skinner lunch
Save money niggas really won't spend a buck
Gimme that cash, that ben what up
Pockets keep that denim bruh like ahh

Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, I'm good
(We back and we back and we back)

(And we back and we back and we back and we back)
Even better than I was the last time

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Rap just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'mma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds zan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggy back on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job
And I'm good

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid, Peter Cottontale, Lili K., & Kiara Lanier]

So good...

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Work, work, work, work, bang nigga, bang
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird; pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn’t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some "x" on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say "The Rapper"
Magical word (poof), please say 'Kadabra
Replay the replays; Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom, bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck a niggas fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album, I ain't even fucking done
I'm good! IGH!

IGH!
Nana naaaaa
Yup
Wooooh, ah!
Nanana

[Verse 1]
Young black boy, how he got the labels scared?
A&R's like, "Chano, you ain't playin' fair!
You gon' set a bad example for the average bear
You a Yogi, you should idle while in child's position"
I be like, naw, these my sons, this prenatal care
I'mma show em how to make it here and make it fair
Take it there, they could kill me and I ain't gon' care
You is just an ankle weight, lighter than some angel cake
Sweeter than some maple syrup, easier than Ableton
Make a plate and make a player
Make em play it
Just don't count your sheep before they hatch
You chickens 'fore your eggs
Eat your dinner 'fore you say your prayer

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Young tactician, just got my taxes finished
Beat the tortoise by a hair in an '04 Ford Taurus
On a spare with a wax finish
There's a lot of metaphors, you just lack vision
You just bad business
UH!
All your shit been lower case
Lower class, lower key
I'm the only minor minority in priority
Sippin' gin and tonic while I plot upon authority
Author of my horoscope, feeling like the oracle
Ain't no rules, nigga
IGH!

[Hook]
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch

[Interlude]
The first is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit a Spotify to qualify a spot on His side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis, the book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak, edify
Electrify the enemy like Hedwig till he petrified
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide, 79th, 79th
I don't believe in science, I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs, color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom
Hosanna Santa invoked and woke up slaves from Southampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, exalt, glorify, descend upon the earth with swords
And fortify the borders where your shortage lie
I used to hide from God, ducked down in the slums like "shhh"

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
I was lost in the jungle like Simba
After the death of Mufasa, no hog, no meerkat
Hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages
But never got no hear back, or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark to gently, gently
Row my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach
My petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud
Couldn't even let my light shine
But you was always there
When I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height we wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalted Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal, it's tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley
For every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations
With a foot on water and a foot on land?
Who was the angel that rode a Harley
From the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber
And put the true name of the Lord in it?
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scriptures
And gave us the pictures of false messiahs, it was all a lie
Mystery babylon, tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground



[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin' in mud
Rolling in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing a Xan
Is hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up
It ain't nothing better than fallin' in love
IGH!

[Hook]
I've seen it come back, back, back and forth
You hit the nail right on top of the head
I know you've seen it all before
But when it looks you in the eyes, it ain't nothin' you could say but "that's love"
That's love
That's love
That's love
Say that's love, ooh ooh
That's lo-o-ove
That's love
That's love, that's love, that's love
I LOVE you! (Love you)
I LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)
I LOVE you! (Love you)
I LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)
I LOVE you! (Love you)
I LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)
I LOVE you! (Love you)
I LOVE you! (Lo-o-ove!)
I LOVE you!
That's love
That's loooo-o-o-ove, that's love
Say that's love, ooh, ooh, that's love
That's love, that's love, that's love, that's love

Thirsty, thirsty, tryna choose
I mean, I know I'm pretty cool
My Nitty bag, my kitty boost
I got the juice, I got the juice

[Verse 1]
Chano, Chatham's own
Foolies glad I'm home
Even my haters kinda glad I'm on
Rest In Peace to my Vagabond
Rapper song, singer, suspended, subpoena
For misdemeanors, dreamer
Held back ass is lowkey still a senior
And I still shake up BO Squad, praying for my BroBois
City on the come up, shout that nigga Sosa!
Shout my nigga Fat Trel, shout my nigga Joseph
Playing Buenos Aires while they sleepin': buenas noches!
Wonder if I wrote this, 'cause it's so crisp
The most brokest cold stock broker, winter solstice
I could win an Oscar, Russian accent husky
Acid addict, costly avid actor, Kevin Costner

Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)

[Verse 2]
God give me one sentence more
Maybe I just gotta get suspended more?
Hashtag it, get mentions for it
Make you love it, get it trending more
And then act humble
Hear some bull that some dude mumble
Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga punk you
Knowin' bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles, IGH!
But I love y'all souls, don't let the juice spill Pac!
Blue pill pop 'til you feel good enough to pop
The popped bitch in the blue heels, yop!
That one, drown in the juice nigga
Hunnid proof get found in a youth nigga
Stop with all the tryna' introduce nigga
Everybody know you dude, you the new nigga!
How's it feel to be you? Yo no sé
I ain't really been myself since Rod passed
I ain't even really need that shop class
I ain't really been weak since pop's smashed

Hit sensei, master
Jack and Lindsey, Wiley, Kembe
Been paid, 10 Day been they FAFSA

Jugo, you never tasted paper
Tripped, racing yaself tryna' chase the paper
I just faced a Veg-er
And you love being Kobe when you make the lay-er
'Til you realize everybody in the world fuckin' hates the Lakers
And then everybody wanna sip
'Til the juice spill everybody wanna bib
And then everybody wanna dip
Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth
Merge the mixture with the purest and the fruits
And the thirst, just the worst, it's the curse of the juice!

[Hook]
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
We used to roll at the Rink, we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place
But in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

[Hook: Towkio]
We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
We ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up with for the weekend
Rolling with your parties
So tell me what you thinkin'
So we gon' have a juke jam
So we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to "I remember you"

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
We never rolled at the Rink
We would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown
I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips
And your legs and my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy
Crazy about you

[Hook: Towkio]
We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
We ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Who came up for the weekend
Rollin with the parties
So tell me what you thinkin'
So we gon' have a juke jam
So we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to "I remember you"

Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile

[Verse 1]
I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy’s a long way from red dolls and green rangers
Things ain’t been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
You don’t think I felt ya hand on my head yelling “Call his father”
But people don’t hear ghosts so how they gon' play me
Money saved me so I’ma do the same thing
You droppin pounds, gettin small on some sick shit
Like how you got the drive but don’t know how to use a stick shift
You better not miss this, overdose, dope and mixes
Let ya throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it
Blast off...

[Verse 2]
Dropping tapes 'til I losted count, coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling I’m Boston bound, bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I’m jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowns
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib I’m falling down
Yeah, I'm steady crawling 'round
I’m calling out to God
Your little angels falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around

[Bridge]
Oh non je t'en prie, nous ne sommes pas chez nous
Oh je t'assure que ce n'est pas grave
Non laisse moi!
Mais qu'est-ce que tu as aujourd'hui?
J'ai que les hommes me dégoûtent. Vous ne pensez qu'à ça

[Hook]
Well it’s been a long time, long time now
Since I’ve seen you smile
And I’ll gamble away my fright
And I’ll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well it’s been a long time, long time now
(Oh it’s, oh it’s been so long)
Since I’ve seen you smile
(It’s been so long)

[Outro: Chance]
Said it’s been a long time, long time now, now, now
Said it’s been a long time, long time now
And it’s been a long time, long time now

I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
She said "pill pop, baby girl 'cause I promise you, you tweaked
The empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek"
The masochism that you preach
Practice back flips, tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

[Hook]

When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby

That shit cray, that shit dead, that shit fake, blast a kid
Cassius Clay at his head, atta boy, atta kid
I'ma need a napkin, cook 'em up
And he gon' need a Aspirin, hook him up
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups
When niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands
That's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking what up, I said on my soul I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end
The others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands
My momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting
I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas
I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I’m going to war with fate and I’m going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers cuz all the reporters lied
I call him my lil homie he brought him a .45
Brown boys are dying, and none of ‘em were for business
And all of em' love they mommas, and all of they mommas miss 'em
And this shit is just stupid, this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive

[Outro]
I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
(And now for something completely different)
And I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
And hoping that I find you
I been hoping that I find you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
(In the real world, we just people with ideas)
(In the real world, we just people with ideas)
I'm missing you
(In the real world, we just people with ideas)

I love my women real tall, ayy
Type that can really play ball, ayy
You buy my hat at the park, ayy
Think I might really play ball, ayy
I got a link in my bio
My bitch do the salsa like pico de gallo
They gotta ask if they may, Cinco de Mayo
How can they call themselves bosses
When they got so many bosses
You gotta see what your boss say
I get it straight out the faucet
I ain't felt like this since the third Drought, third Carter drop
Told my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop
And yeah, my momma got real worried when she heard college drop
But now I call the shots

[Hook: Chance The Rapper + Young Thug]
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I swear I'm the only nigga still cares about mixtapes

Bad little mama, she gettin' it Obama
She sting like a bumble bee, hot as the sauna
She shine like a Rollie, got that from her momma
Can't see me, can't be me, I'm ridin' like a panda
That booty gon' roll and it's outta control
And these bitches gon' fuck off respect and that loyalty
All my bitches lovin' me and they spoil me
Rub me down with that lotion, babe oil me
Drinking Actavis, baby I'm showin' me
In that choppa I see your perimeter
Change the culture, cause my ring is a solar
Wait one minute I told you
Yeah, I would like to know you
Yeah, you lucky like clovers
Yeah, the clothes no good
Mama I do it
The racks I pursue it
Just look at me baby

I'm ballin' on you like I'm Chris Paul

[Hook: Chance The Rapper + Young Thug]
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I swear I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Am I the only one who really care about cover art?
Growing up I ain't have my brother
'Cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start
I ain't know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now I'm stunting like bling
Time and time again, they told me no
They told me I wouldn't go
'Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well, maybe that shit was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After 1Night the folks thought I was finished
I pinned my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh, bitch I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer
Oh, they fuck with me cause I'm different
New sound, new appearance
Bitch, it's Boat from the 6
Give a fuck about a bitch
Walk out, my hand on my dick, I'm the shit

[Hook: Chance The Rapper + Young Thug]
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I said am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Introducin' Chance the Ruthless, trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid, loosely based on music, swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (BANG!)
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of allusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended, last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley, always in the hallway
So I never been classy (Ha ha ha)
Shut up!

[Hook: Chance the Rapper]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(IGH, IGH, IGH, IGH!)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Acid, Acid, get it? Acid, melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper if this was work, I'd get higher
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with Jack
Lickety-split, look it! He slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana splits back, give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra I eat it like Idi Amin
Ya kna wha' mean, hit me back when that mean shit

[Hook: Chance the Rapper]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
Introducin', it’s Bronsonlino
With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino
Three Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow, oh
I rep the East Coast
I got a team of hoes like Pat Summitt
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer
(Get to the chopper!)
I splash summer like a fast brother, with a number on his back
Ain’t no fumblin', in fact, I'm back, acid in my hat
Shoot, then pass the gat
It's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag
My new shorty got a gymnastic back
'87 emerald green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef’s salad
She had the club foot, with that little arm
I couldn’t help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on

[Outro: Action Bronson]
Suck my motherfucking dick
It's the young Randy Velarde
Queens, baby
Blow me

I hate a stranger, hate his boss, I hate his friend

I hate my hands, handshakes, pancakes, milkshakes
Child-resistant locks on the pill case
I hate inflation, hate the store, I hate to choose
I hate the war, I hate the poor, I hate the news
I hate the late, I can't be early, hate to wait
I hate my lovers cause the way they suffocate

I hate the optimistic smirks on the face of children
I hate the government and those who deface its buildings
I hate artists, hate creatives, I hate bright people
I hate darkness, I hate racists, I hate white people
I hate small speakers, I hate loud speakers
I hate great concerts, I don't like crowds neither
I hate money, I hate change, I hate hope
I hate funny, I hate strange, I hate dope
I hate charities and parodies and tragedies
I hate carrots, peas, asparagus
Virtually all vegetables, circuses, all festivals
Texts that are oversexual, motion because it's perpetual

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!

Ooh, watch me come and put the hinges in their hands
Countin' Benjis while we meetin', make 'em shake my other hand
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings out my lap
Bitch I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap, hey
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?

You talk that talk that make a lame ass nigga fall in love

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht, no power steering
Aye, aye, captain
I'm high, captain
I'm so high
Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Yep, yep!
Pull up in the new thing, I'm like
They be like, "There he go!"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih!
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
They say so, ridin' with the payo'
They be like, "There he go!"

[Intro]
"He should try enjoying life, rather than spending his time trying to outsmart me. While he's alive, that is"

"I know what you're saying but it's not that simple, it's just human nature"

"What's that guy doing, I wonder?"

[Verse 1]
I still got orange and white cassette tapes
Tents where my neighbor came to spectate
Niggas that’s tough now used to get little in the dark
It’s all cool now, we’re all little kids at heart
Accident prone Chance, y'all remember 'bout
The time I cracked my head open at Auntie Linda’s House
From diapers to outfits to castles to Elmos
From Santas to Grandmas to Gameboys and cellphones
Rocked your world, fourth grade talent show
Jada and Justin’s birthday magic show
Games of tips taking niggas to school
Two quarters and I’ll bust your ass at pool, on bull
Round here we lose best friends like every week
I like to think we playin a long game of hide and go seek
And one day maybe I’ma find Terrance and I could lead them
Kids of the Kingdom singing about freedom

[Hook]
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Verse 2]
Let’s take it back like Indian givers
To Indian burns and Jiminy Crickets
To the smell of Pillsbury on biscuit mornings
To puffy wintercoats and Christmas mornings
I used to chill with the kids next door
And SpongeBob came around 'bout four
And then I’d hang with Bart’s guys
Around the bend was Smart Guy
Flipping through the picture books
Checking through my archives
Remember the old days, the ones you’ll never get back
At the end of parties, passing around gift bags
Now we blow entire O's at one kick back
MY$FITS and mismatch that get off like wrist slaps, uhh

[Hook]
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Verse 3]
Remember Jeepers and Odyssey Fun World
Young pimpin' like you oughta see one girl
Mama Jann, mama Charlie, and my mama Lisa
Booster seat used to boost my kitty, Connie's Pizza
And every year we made a Christmas list
And Auntie Linda cooked a Christmas dish
And all of our grandparents made a Christmas wish
Like “Lord, let me see another year like this”, uhh

[Hook]
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Verse 1]
Charlie Bartlett, John Bender
Class Switcher, Time Bender
Chance Bennett, a peculiar name
Graduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name
You made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job
We was all outcasts, only listened to Good Mob
I performed at fun fair, fun fact
I'm never going back to school, been there, done that
They see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps
Don't call it impossible, if you really want that
They send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback
I just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back
Chano y tequila you know you know you don't want that
I rap my songs in Spanglish, I wrap my weed in blunt wraps
Wrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped
As if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap
Yo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?
Now I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping
I should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening
I just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain
It's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking
Sip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing
Fuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham
Until the day they said I would have to chat without em
And I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right
Here's a brighter bulb for your limelight
And this is your night, homie, shine bright
This for everybody's fucking prom night

[Hook]
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

[Verse 2]
Uh, yo this prom shit feel like the Grammy's yo
These pictures Granny took gonna make me ask where'd Granny go
So pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo
And snap a couple candid's of the family, get some cameos
You can change the clocks but you can't change hours
I'm waiting on the day, Spring can't bring flowers
Let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours
And pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers
And hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy
The hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely
So go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty
This to a moment's glimpse at royalty
This is for my momma Jan who spoiled me
Look what we've accomplished
Time flies, watches look like magnets on a compass
Before we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo
Bumping 10 Day with the Angels with Jesus shopping my demo
And rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping
And damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened
But it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin
I did a show at AKIN and I would do it again

[Hook]
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

[Verse 3]
Look at, look at your business tux, all night airplane
Go and get your racist on, all white everything
I'm on my paper now, put that on my heading
I ain't even write this down I don't write errthing
I know y'all don't like everything
She want a night she can call her wedding
Giving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches
Nose diving, going all night sledding
Coked out like "Don't change when you grow up
I hope you get some change when you blow up"
Cause honestly I've always loved the way that you could throw up
Rest up on my shoulder, float up flying lotus
"You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda
You deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa
You deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara
And a hand to wipe away all that running mascara"
But I, I want to thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
I really enjoyed my prom night

[Hook]
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

[Outro]
So good, so right, hey baby
So good, so right
You know it feels so good
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right
To be with you tonight

Ten damn days
And all I got to show for it is shoes, and shows, and chauffeurs with road rage
Still the same damn ad-lib: IGH!, old ways
Still got a letterman, no practice
Still got a burner, man, no lacking
Still outtin' Jams nigga, no Jackson
No Jordan and we toe-tagging
I'll take you to land, where the lake made of sand
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance
And the money ain't yours
Now it's just a red pill
Got a blue and a hand full of Advils
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it, Nitty the old me
So I'mma tell the buyer what Nitty told me

[Hook: Nate Fox]

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You a laaaaaaaame, and your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets
And a Reader or a RedEye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D
Even though I only beat one time
One time, it was one two times
It was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex
Got neck from all these thots I sex
Rastafari them shottas, yes
House safari, mi casa, yes
Poppy fields of that popeye
She came to party, she popped a Molly
Said, "Come to papa", she said, "Papa, yes"

I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Move to the neighborhood; I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain Save-a-Hood, hood savior, baby boy
Still getting ID'd for Swishers (Mama still wash my clothes)
Still with the Save Money militia (I'mma still watch my bros)
Trapped in the middle of the map with a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That, with a literary knack, and a little shitty Mac, and like literally jack

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at? Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees, look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not, I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip

[Breakdown: Chance The Rapper]
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
I know you scared
Me too
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring

[Breakdown: Chance The Rapper]
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too



[Chorus 1]
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 1]
When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

[Chorus 2]
'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 2]
Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?

[Chorus 3: Chance The Rapper + (Eryn Allen Kane)]
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs

[Outro: Chance The Rapper + (Eryn Allen Kane)]
(Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics)
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
(It's so natural
Just like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
(Do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't....)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion



[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Mmm, IGH!
Acid Rap!

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I don't even talk to them on the phone again

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Who smokin' in my car? it's that nigga Chano
AKA Mr. Bennett,   AK Tony Montano
I've got some folks in low end, I got some folks in C-note
AK hundred dinero, you ever seen Casino?
I just got back with 'Bino, I got a bitch but she know
Her friends done did the Dino, that's that Chicago lingo
Flamin' hots with cheese, and a Kiwi Mistic
My dick won't even call her, cause she left all that lipstick
Niggas be on dirt, that's why I stay on petty
I know that bangers jam, that's why my hands stay ready
Flip the candy yum, that's the fucking bombest
Lean all on the square, that's a fuckin' rhombus

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Who's sneaking in the club? that's that young sir rapper
Un-saran wrap the purple, wrap that blunt under after
Smoke all out the window, cops could eat a dick
If you ain't the hitter, you just might be the lick
Flame on, flame on, I'm your bitch's ringtone
She like when I rap raps, but better when I sing songs
No Drake, but I get my Trey on, killin' in the hood like Trayvon
Shoppin' like I got a coupon, savin' like I got a cape on
Cookin' crack in my apron, dressed like a nigga had 8 proms
Tell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm
Trippy shit to watch drugs while on the clock
Acid on the face that's a work of art

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Soulo hoe hoe twerk somethin'
Throw it back like you tryna hurt somethin'
I'm so def, I ain't ever heard nothin'
My name Herb, take herb, smoke herb (say word?)
How 'bout you? No dap, but I'll take a pound or two
No doubt like Gwen Stefani's group
Look, let me put my mouth where you potty, boo (IGH!)
Them niggas pissed, need potty training
They movement shit, that's a potty train
She ain't left yet, but she probably came
We kicked it then I score, soccer game
She was a phony goalie, I got great aim though, don't insult me
I'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me
My name Soulo cause I'm the one and only
She only got you as a nigga on the side
That's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie
Then we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard
Music and tabs of Lucy, take your chance with this rapper

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do

[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking a, we just
What the fuck is going on?
When did we buy a bowl?

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
We just been smoking a bowl
We don't got no time to roll
I'm always out on the road
She don't got time for a whole
Little bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
It don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board, yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry a child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her, I tell her

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Let me crack this blunt
Slow it down for a second
Break it down, ooh
She said, "let me lick this blunt"
Slow it down for a second
Break it down, ooh
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Truth being told, we used to movies and bowl
We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes
You pat my back when I choke
Wish we were stuck in our ways
We way too young to get old
We stuck together like oowops
We smoke to Fetty, sing ZooWap
Traphouse 3, Guwop
I shoulda knew when I grew up
It would be no time at all
We went from White Owls to Raws
We went from joints to a bowl
She need a second to breathe
We need an actual smoke sesh

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Let me crack your back
Slow it down for a second
Take it down, ooh
Let me run this back
Slow it down for a minute
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break

[Verse 3: Future]
I don't have time to finesse
I put some ice on your neck
But I ain't holding you back
I spend my time on the road
Super ain't saving no hoes
I don't have time to patrol
Let me break these bales right down for a second
When it touch down, ooh
I got to lay back the roof
I got her breakin' the new rules
She can't be taking no calls
When she involved with a boss
Please don't get lost in the sauce
Please don't get lost in the sauce
She been like this from the door
Told me her mom was a whore
I gave her percs for myself
I give her a perc for esteem
I'm tryna crown me a queen
You hear the chains when they cling
I take the molly its clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be overseas
I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor
I got designer galore
I keep some Goyard and gars
I smoke out all of my cars
You smell the weed in the air
You smell the smoke in the seats
You went and had our child
You didn't abandon the D
You got me twisted at least
You can

[Hook: Chance The Rapper & Future]
Let me crack your back
Let me rub you all over
Take it down, ooh
Let me make this blunt
Make you dinner or somethin'
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, a smoke break



[Intro: Francis & The Lights]
Oh, oh, oh, incredible
My lord...incredible
I believe...

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Socks on concrete, jolly rancher kids
I was talking back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib
Bunch of tank top, nappy headed bike-stealing Chatham boys
None of my niggas ain't had no dad
None of my niggas ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them
79th street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We still catching lightning bugs
When the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark cause the big shawtys act hard
Okay now, day camp at Grand Crossing
First day, nigga's shooting
Summer school get to losing students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't, our summer
Our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die, our summer time don't got no time no more

[Hook: Chance The Rapper + Francis & The Lights]
(You're my friend)
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay, stay around
Summer friends, summer friends
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay, hey
Stay around here

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Oh I used to kill 'em with the long hair
Momma hair salon doing perms out the armchair
Dad was working late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare
I would mow some lawns
Fold my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh!
Now I'm the same way, over time all the time, every night, hey
Ready my blessing, now I'm ready how I wait
Never let a friendship get in my way
Never let a blog get in my way
Make the whole song do whatever I say
79, 79, 79, place
79, 79, 79, place
Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork
They was good friends but I faked the flirt
Cause if it ain't work, can't make it work
It's been a minute since I called on a friend
Fucked up and fucked all my friends, all my friends
All my friends, all my...

[Chorus 2: Chance The Rapper + Francis & The Lights]
Stick around
Summer friends, summer...
You're my friend...
Summer friends don't stick around
Stick around, hey
And some of us...
79, 79, 79, hey
79, 79, 79, hey
79, 79, 79, hey, hey, hey
You're my friend
79, 79, 79, hey, 79
So put your head on my shoulder
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide
Citywide, citywide, citywide
Citywide, citywide, citywide
Citywide, citywide, citywide
Citywide, citywide, citywide....
I will wait around for you
I will wait around for you
So lay your head on my table
Lay your head on my table

[Interlude]
May the Lord give your journey mercy
May you be successful, grant you favor
And bring you back safely, I love you

[Outro: Jeremih]
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed, a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed, a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up



[Intro]
Happy holidays Mr President

[Verse 1: Chance]
She can say in her voice, in her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a feature so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is handmade, pan fried, sun-dried
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, saying to her
Something told me I should bring my butt to church

[Hook: Jamila Woods]
You gotta move slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for this whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for this whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy

[Bridge: Jamila Woods (Chance) [Choir]]
Come on in this house, it's gonna rain
(Mama you know!)
Rain down Zion
(Rain down)
It's gonna rain
(Mama you know!)
[You gotta move slowly]
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
(Mama you know!)
(Mama you know!)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget
I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like lights, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I haven't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church

[Bridge: Jamila Woods (Chance)]
You better come on in this house
(Come on in this house)
Cause it's gonna rain
(Mama you know it's gonna rain)
Rain down Zion
(Rain down)
It's gonna rain
(Mama you know it's gonna rain)
Come on down in this house
It's gonna rain
(Mama you know)
Rain down

[Interlude: Chance (Jamilla + Choir)]
Mama you know it's gon' rain
Father you know
(Rain down)
Promise you said it would rain
Finally I'm home
(Rain down)
You left on the light
When I left on a flight
But I made it alright
(Rain down)
I've been waiting all week
I've been waiting all night
(On me, rain down)
Baby, saving my life
Had to say something on Saturday
See you at church on Sunday
Open mic coming on Monday
I wonder what the Internet gon' say
When SNL end with the ending to the 3rd
Chance fly down the chimney
Me and Kiersten, Kensley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy all should win the Emmy
Momma should too!

[Bridge: Jamila Woods and Others]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
This is six blunt rotation music
This is just got off six month probation music
This is steppin' on the beach
When you're too drunk to feel a beat
This that laughing in a condo
Throwin' shit down in the street
This that shouts to the Ave, shouts to the lab
Shouts to the clucks, shouts to the strags
This for every math class that I ever had
So fuck you if I failed, and fuck you if I passed!
For shitty summaries and bummers in the past
Cause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class
Some of us is seeing summer, some of us have passed
Some of us ain't seeing summer, some of us have passed
So I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass
Cause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav
And heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave
We on the ground yelling, "Give my nigga back!"

[Hook: Akenya Seymour]
And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Another weekend full of blunts and brews
Too comfortable, yelling "Fuck a school"
Ain't seen the world before noon in like a month or two
Blunts to the face, bottles to the dome
Niggas never need no cup
Livin' out dreams, never givin' hopes up
Ridin' with them Vill niggas, never givin' no fucks
In the game tryna get our feel, tryna get a deal
Tryna get a million
Just ridin' around with my niggas and them
Real white nigga man mean real appeal
We go all out 'til we fall out
Niggas get called out then hauled out
With the windows down we like to smoke all out
Drink 'til I fall out, fuck is you tahm bout boy
The Village is my brothers
It's me, Mikey, Kembe trappin'
Hella love for Chance The Rapper
We know 10 Day is a classic, on God

[Hook: Akenya Seymour & Chance The Rapper]
And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
This is for sand in my shoes, shout out to Oak Street
For the free train rides, shout out to Polk Street
To the ice cream man you just on hella dirt
How you don't see us can't hear us, you Helen Keller
But I'mma save my dollars for Mary Jane and embellish her
Inhalin' her, smellin' her, maybe sellin' her
You niggas got cold feet, shouts to Luke Helliker
But that's my homie, my dude be droppin' hella verses
So, shouts to D.O.C. and Nu Tribe too
Man we out this jam, see how new guys do
But its still save money like a coupon
So you can catch me off of the Ave gettin' my stoop on

[Hook: Akenya Seymour & Chance The Rapper]
And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down



[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
It's all black
Your kingdom's turned me blank
I'm paper and I'm snow
I'm lost but I can't slow
I'm lost but not alone
It's so light
The dark it burns my eyes
My bones, they used to glow
But now I'm throwing stones
I'm losing where to go

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Shadows on my back are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these horses will say fly
Falling hard, falling high, through your arms
Shadows in my head don't need no light
They stay through the night

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Without you, my lips are turning blue
The water pulls me down
And drowns under your sound
This silence booms so loud
I'm locked up
Your kingdom's like a drug
The chains are made of glass
I'm breaking through your blood
I'm never strong enough

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Shadows on my back are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these horses will say fly
Falling hard, falling high, through your arms
Shadows in my head don't need no light
They stay through the night

[Verse 3: Simon Le Bon]
To every rose with bloody thorn
It lifts you up and lets you fall
To rivers flowing yond the factory halls
Your kingdom's come, it's waiting still
The space between you'll never fill
I tried but I could not change your mind

[Outro: Charli XCX]
I dance around, and I lost you now
I breathed you out, I kept you out
But if I could, I'd turn back around



[Intro: Juicy J]
Cash nigga
We throw that shit away
Just spend all of it you dig?
Stay in the strip club
Sip a lot of Lean
Smoke a lot of weed
Drink gin and whatever you want

Hop out, hop out, hop out, hop out

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
I’m blowin’ down the 1-01 and I’m rollin’ just like a pill baby

Yea, so with this money they ain’t seein’ me
Shout out my nigga Soulja and you know that’s SODMG
You know I never take a day off
I’m ballin’ off for extra shit, my nigga that’s the play-offs

Yea, me and dat money, we just made a date

Yea, so what all that beefin’ we ain’t worried ‘bout
My niggas eat that shit for lunch, they call it in and out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Stuntin' all a nigga doin’ now

Double cup and smoked out in my latest car

My team is full of ballin’ niggas, why you actin’ hard?

Hall of famer, everybody know my name (trippy)

[Chorus: Jenn Em]
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I was sittin' at home, I was rollin' a blunt
I was thinkin' 'bout you been dead gone
Got a call from my boys like, "Your cousin is dead"
I was like, "He couldn't have had his head on"
I be suited, I be booted, ready for anything
Give me the chance then I'll head home
I pull up, get that check, when I leave best believe
On the freeway I'm headin' home
I done partied, I done sipped Bacardi
Rollin' with Blood, we done crashed all the parties
We done rode Ferraris, rode Lamborghinis
Now only thing that I care about is breathing
Why I go hard, Blood be the reason
Wouldn't want me to quit even if I was bleedin'
Gotta take charge, every four seasons
Every month, every day and every weekend

[Chorus: Jenn Em]
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I bet you remember posted on the block
All we knew was shots
We ain't really know about the guap
All we knew was Glocks
I remember when you called my phone tweakin'
You got your first deal, you was geekin'
Remember when I got my first deal, I hit you on the phone
Like for now I am Chief Sosa Yeezus
You was like, "Nah you're Almighty"
Almighty don't like nobody
Shootin' .40 cals, now we gettin' 40
Bands for a show and we stay 'til the morning
God chose us, and gave it up
Dead or alive, niggas still hatin' us
It's the end of the quarter, I'm a rock with sticky D
I'ma pass the pall to you and you can hang it up

[Chorus: Jenn Em]
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say

[Outro: Chief Keef]
No matter what I might say
No matter what you might say
No matter what I say
No matter what your friends say
No matter what our friends say
No matter what, what I say
No matter what, what I say
Just know this, I miss you Big Glo

[Hook]
I'ma bad motherfucker, swish, I'ma splash brother
Ice on me, colder than Chiraq weather
I'ma bad mamba jamba, and I keep a hammer
Wanna see a nigga dead, wanna see me in the slammer
I'm so badass, fool, I can buy a school
Shawty send me nudes, I ain't wearing Trues
I'ma bad motherfucker
It can crash, motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Cracking cards, you lil fraud
The ink in this choppa still pass pipes
I’m pulling all nighters, I’m not tired
You can see me from afar
Grab a pound of smokes then I roll it up
Take your block and I blow it up
Got in her back and I tore it up
Adobe Lightroom, how I'm gloing up
My wrist like water
Now I got more money than my father
Like El Chapo, bitch we kill your honor
I pass the streets with flying colors

[Hook]
I'ma bad motherfucker, swish, I'ma splash brother

Shawty send me nudes, I ain't wearing Trues
I'ma bad motherfucker
It can crash, motherfucker

[Verse 2]
I get this swagga from my mama
Grab the bullets for my llama
Ride right or wrong with my partner
Burger king I got that whopper
And I'm on some playa shit, facial cleanser with cucumbers
Like Tadoe I'm counting blue bummas
Smelling just like some new money
My chain looking like a [?]
All this loud I can't hear you (dope)
The cops is all outside, money and bitches there too
Baby I'm so mellow, won't go slow yellow
If you catch me sleep, one eyes open though
This bitch heads a freak, we're up in a suite
Gat, when I sleep, I feel like Memphis Bleek
What hand you rolling with? Im feeling like I'm Beans
Pass me the throne, I'm feeling like a king

[Hook]
I'ma bad motherfucker, swish, I'ma splash brother

Shawty send me nudes, I ain't wearing Trues
I'ma bad motherfucker

[Chorus]
Count that cash fast
And you know I'm smokin' big gas bags
Hit Saks with big ass cash backs
Don't come to Chiraq, you're better off in Baghdad
Where the fuck is the money? Let me get that
Everyday designer, but it's mismatched
Where that Reese money 'cause we need that
Ain't see you on yo block, but we gon' be back

[Verse 1]
I got big knots, in my Balmains
I be balling, like a ball game
Get to sparkin', no talkin'
Chopper in the bag, make the mall rain
Bitch, it's Chief So, where the beef go?
Talking like you 'bout it, where your teeth go?
I got the heat though, for niggas trickos
Stack blue cheese up, like they Pringles

[Chorus]
Count that cash fast
And you know I'm smokin' big gas bags
Hit Saks with big ass cash backs
Don't come to Chiraq, you're better off in Baghdad
Where the fuck is the money? Let me get that
Everyday designer, but it's mismatched
Where that Reese money 'cause we need that
Ain't see you on yo block, but we gon' be back

[Verse 2]
Hop in a switch up, commit a pick up
I'm in a foreign truck, gettin' my dick sucked
New Louies, come take a picture
Commit a touchdown, from a kick-up
2 3 finna stick up, how your stick-up?
How your funds up? How your quick-up?
When it's time for the hit, uh, don't catch the hiccups
You ain't really 'bout it, give that stick up

[Chorus]
Count that cash fast
And you know I'm smokin' big gas bags
Hit Saks with big ass cash backs
Don't come to Chiraq, you're better off in Baghdad
Where the fuck is the money? Let me get that
Everyday designer, but it's mismatched
Where that Reese money 'cause we need that
Ain't see you on yo block, but we gon' be back



[Hook: Chief Keef]
Ask grandma for fifty, grandma she gave me a hundred
I ran off with the money, then brought back some money
Smoking green dope shit reekin like fried onions
I take any money, froze money or fried money
I be trapping, I ain't lacking, nigga I ain't worried
I will let my Gun blow, nigga I ain't scared
I'm a warrior with a thirty, nigga I ain't Curry
Check out my watch nigga my diamonds glisten, they ain't blurry

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I was in Wokcano's eating on some curry
But wanting to hit thirty-four bitch that's Eddy Curry
I'm still smoking loud even though you hear me
Bitch I'm in the field White Sox Paul Konerko
Get my hittas on you, Ronald Belasario
To that bitch that gave me head last night nerdy ho
Throwing money in the club I'm a pitcher run your's up
And I swear my watch a thot, it is a lil flirty ho
Pull up doing hits, eating on some cereal
White chocolate, white milk, red cheerios
Shoot the red guts out a nigga red gut material

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tadoe]

Got a thousand for a hundred pack then pick it up

[Verse 2: Tadoe]
Nigga said can he be Glo I'm not feeling ya

[Verse 1]
In the AMG, lookin' like I cook dope
Since I'm a fucking pimp, I'ma need a good hoe
Catch your ass lackin', give your ass some good smoke
The bitch up in this foreign will give your ass some good throat
The bitch up in the trap will give your ass a good pack
The shooter ridin' with me get your ass in a bag
Beef ain't really nothin', nah, really it's a snack
Before I made it here, I was runnin' through the packs
Runnin' thru the racks up in Saks, it's a fact
To ride presidential, I done blacked out the 'lac
Put the rover up and I done backed out the back
Told 'em send the fiends to the back house for crack
I hop up out the whip, look like I sell controlled substances
When she see the ice, I bet I leave the bitch like, ''Oh, shit!''
Lookin' like the plug, 'cause I'm really on my boss shit
Trapper on my lap, just in case I have to bust shit

[Chorus]
Cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope

Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope

[Verse 2]
Got a hundred bags, served all dimes
Got a thousand more of those, call the line
Snowman, I want seventeen fives
Why a dealership tellin' me lies?
Told me that my trunk was up in the front
But it's in the back, bitches think it's summer
Slide the van doors, beat a nigga drum
I promise you won't even see a nigga comin'
'Cause I move like Obama, probably fucked your mama
Saw a bad bitch walkin', she want me to run up
She saw the falcon stripes down the middle of the foreign
Saw the fire out the pipes then Ii knew that bitch was goin'
Don't make me hit your college, fuck your bitch up in your dorm
I don't even know her, too many bitches in my phone
Let me cut this Marvin on, that mean we can get it on
You know bitches love dope, that's why they can't leave me 'lone

[Chorus]
Cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope
It look like I cook dope
Cook dope, cook dope, cook dope

You ain't sipping drank, that shit head
Hoes in my car, asking me for a cup, that's his bitch

It's payday everyday
You ain't tryna fuck, bitch, skate
Can't come through, ball and no chain
Adios, knock 'em back to 5th grade

All hundreds on me, but I'm on a rampage
My ice kicking ass, no MMA
Yeah, I'm sippin' hardt

If it ain't purple then I can't see you (see you)
Bitch just text me saying "I'm gon' free you when I see you"

[Chorus]
I was busy slidin' in the 918 (skrrt)
Baby momma text me at 5:18 (yah)
Bad bitch text me at 6:16 (bitch)
'Bout 7 A.M. she was neckin' me
Why she send these kissy face emojis to my phone? (huh?)
She diggin' hard on a nigga 'cause I'm goin' strong
She don't wanna smoke because what I smoke is strong
I'm in it all night, don't know when she goin' home

[Verse 1]
She gon' slob on my knob like a corn on the cob
But we can't go out in public, there's paparazzi to dodge
As I'm droppin' the top, told her shoot for the stars
I know she gon' love me because every woman does
As I slide in that water she get wet like a slide
No I cannot stop her, she gon' go like a ride
Keep that thing clean, it be smellin' like some Tide
But no I cannot wife her so it's lookin' like divide
She noticed me in the strip club throwin' racks
It was me and the gang, we was lookin' like a tribe
When she came to the crib it was lookin' like a vibe
Shawty got that head on her that I can't describe

[Chorus]
I was busy slidin' in the 918 (skrrt)
Baby momma text me at 5:18 (yah)
Bad bitch text me at 6:16 (bitch)
'Bout 7 A.M. she was neckin' me
Why she send these kissy face emojis to my phone? (huh?)
She diggin' hard on a nigga 'cause I'm goin' strong
She don't wanna smoke because what I smoke is strong
I'm in it all night, don't know when she goin' home

[Verse 2]
Shawty gettin' free feels, put her hands on my wheel
But I can't really trust her, got my hands on the steel (bang)
I go in for the kill, rollin' like a ferris wheel
She get wetter than a ship, shawty got that Navy Seal
She was talkin' all tough, but I got her walkin' stiff
We had a bet that if I hit it good, she would make me meals
You would think it's homicide how I hit her with the steel
All this energy it took, I should hit her with a bill
She really want it all so I hit her with a lil'
Yeah she say she want some more, say that's all I got to give
No relationship, a friend zone is all I got to build
When it come to catchin' bodies, girl I got a lot of kills

[Chorus]
I was busy slidin' in the 918 (skrrt)
Baby momma text me at 5:18 (yah)
Bad bitch text me at 6:16 (bitch)
'Bout 7 A.M. she was neckin' me
Why she send these kissy face emojis to my phone? (huh?)
She diggin' hard on a nigga 'cause I'm goin' strong
She don't wanna smoke because what I smoke is strong
I'm in it all night, don't know when she goin' home (bang!)



[Hook]
Mama say I have trust issues

These bitches love Turbo and I love the purple
I ball, Tyrese Gibson, baby boy, you look so fertile
These bitches love Otto, their mouths be wide open
Been gettin' it since snot nose, I was open and then I closed
These bitches love Chief Lo, but I'm not so sweet though
And she is a freak though, I put her to sleep though
These hoes love Almighty, like Disney loved Miley
Her boyfriend is spying, she's like, "you have to hide me"
These bitches love me, that's all I can see
I'm so obsessed with me, I be all I can be
I don't see brown or white, all I see is green
To count all this cash, I might need a team

[Hook]
Mama say I have trust issues
I been feelin' like Jesus
She wants me to be her man
I can't baby, I'ma break you
Baby, I would not lie to you
I'd be careful if I were you
I'm the one, but you might be the two
I'm not that liable
Call me, pull off, skr-skr-skr-skr
Smoking that a-la-la-la
Give me that ah-ya-ya-ya
Call me, let me pull off, right now, right now-now
And when this drop starts to drop, baby look in the sky and grab a star (bang)

[Verse 2]
Ooh, my car so retarded, the bitch just farted
Pulled off like skrt, VIP access, I ain't gotta park it
All these darts on me no Walmart, will never fuck with Target
And I'm sipping, but I can't stop, I can't be hardened
These bitches love Big Gucci So, but I'm no rooty tooty though
Don't want to talk so that's all you can know
Row row ya boat, that's all you can roll
I'm stuffing these cones like an audience close
And I'm not really an American though
But I'm somewhere in the Madigan dough
But I walk around like a mannequin though
Now yo bitch on the way
She want this on me
But she's listening, can a bitch hold me?
You can be lactose, still can't shit on me
Do the whole 200 on dash, with a 150 [?]

[Hook]
Mama say I have trust issues
I been feelin' like Jesus
She wants me to be her man
I can't baby, I'ma break you
Baby, I would not lie to you

I'm not that liable
Call me, pull off, skr-skr-skr-skr

Bitch nigga we drill, forreal
So don't fuck around and get killed
On probation but I'm still
Chasin' that bag till I get killed
Money be the medicine cause bitch we need it
And those snitch niggas don't see it
Like Michael Jackson they ass can beat it
Hit a bitch once then she know I'm leaving
And they say I'm hot, but bitch I'm steamin'
On my dick for no apparent reason
Taking off ain't what it's seemin'
God be tellin' me that I'm a demon

And like kickstands bitch I'm leaning
Bitch I go hard, can't fuck with me
Yo baby momma know Chief Keef

Guns filled to the max

And I don't wanna feel my face, pop a pill just in case

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
So much loud to the head that I can't feel my face
30 bullets in the clip, you know they can get replaced

Don't get shot in the face
If you run, bullets chase
Make his ass shake

Don't get caught lackin'

Straight grind, no sleep

And the guys do the same so we just have a feast

We can have a meeting but let's see if Keef on time

[Hook]
I'm a dog and it's true, baby
Can we call this here a truce, baby?
And you know I got the juice, baby
And you see me in this coupe, baby
You say you off at 2, baby
What you gon' let me do baby?
I'm smokin' on this took, baby
There is no one like you, baby
My baby is the dope

[Verse 1]
I bet you ain't smoking on the strongest shit right now
I bet you smoking blow can't tell me what you feel right now
I bet you smoking reggie acting like it's kill right now
I just flamed up the loud so I can't even hear right now
My shorties come through sparking out the cut right here right now
We see you holding on the loud weed like it's some fire
You trying to smoke what I smoke, you take a hit and die
I love this shit so much I might just take a hit then cry
I'll be done with this blunt in 4, take your bitch in 5
Truck on 26's, make me skip to 9
My motherfuckin' riches, make me skip the line
I swear that the dope the only thing that get me high

[Hook]
I'm a dog in this True, baby

[Verse 2]
I got pints on pints, blunts on blunts
I got swag on swag, stunts on stunts
Troopers pulled us over, we smelled like blunts
I was full off dope, that's my lunch
You need to see this big ass blunt that I'm smokin' on
This all for me partner
You should see this big ass blunt that I'm chokin' on
I'ma need a doctor
I just flamed it up, ain't no changing up
You see how high I am, then why you bring it up?
You know what's in my cup, my cup filled with mud
To those who I influence, just say no to drugs

[Hook]
I'm a dog in this True, baby
Can we call this here a truce, baby?
And you know I got the juice, baby

[Hook]
You know them niggas hate every time I come around
Look at me at the red light, that's right
If you try me, you know you're dead, right?
She get a wetty in her leggings when I pull up in my foreign car
Hop out that bitch, it's looking like I write checks
I'm a young icy nigga, aren't I?
This blunt I'm smoking on is bigger than my head

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about the blunt I'm smoking on
This shit hit so strong, I can't leave it alone
Let me tell you about your bitch I'm fucking on
She suck me like it's right, when she in her wrong
Let me tell you about this car that I'm gon' bend
When I let the top down, bitch I'm in the wind
Let me tell you about the money that I spend
Hit Louis Vuitton, after I hit Fendi
I just poured a whole pint and I will fuck your wife
I don't care if y'all was just married
Tell that bitch, "stop staring at me"

[Hook]
You know them niggas hate every time I come around
Look at me at the red light, that's right

I'm a young icy nigga, aren't I?
This blunt I'm smoking on is bigger than my head

[Verse 2]
You don't be sipping no drank (you don't sip no drank)
You don't be fucking the hoes (you don't fuck no thots)
You don't be counting them Pros (you don't count on me)
I pour 12's, you pour up 4's (bitch, I pour a lot)
Girl know he is a lame ass nigga
A real nigga can't paint that picture
Baby girl, I don't want no relations
'Cause any nigga can roll that swisher
Who smokes the most dope?
Who's dodging these hoes?
Got cash, I need mo'
So I'm finding nemo

[Hook]
You know them niggas hate every time I come around

Got a crazy loud affect, all you smell on me is kush
Bitch I'm rolling off a pill
Catch 8, like a hook
Man, my niggas we be swole
Ready to blow them poles
We on ready, set, go, we charge his ass like rhinos
Want beef? We turn up
Watch me shoot him in his face
Pour a four in my sprite, more loud on the way
See that kush I'ma smoke until I fucking choke
See They Got Pounds On The Smoke
He Can Get His ass polled
See I'm Chief Keef and these bitches know about me
Team King Dart Gang bitch Nigga, 300 GBE
And I'm screaming A.O.N
And blowing loud with DJ Kenn
Make a stupid horror scene
Then I'm gone in the wind
No we ain't gon' fight, but he gon' get shot by tonight
I be off all types of shits
Make bullets fly like kites

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All we know to do is smash, on a peon nigga ass
And this purple smell like grass
And that green like some cash
Smash on that nigga he don't want to up on his knocking
Better stop it before we cock it, then go inside his pockets
We smash on niggas, blow kush on niggas
In a party off a pill, then we push on niggas
So what you talking 'bout? Have them guys outside your house
Ready to smash on you and whoever else coming out
If you smash on niggas, then throw Your Ls Up
Because these niggas know we deliver bullets like mail trucks
Nigga open this vault, or get hit with this pole
When we let these hammers go, you think it's July The 4th
Bitch I'm out here with my hammer up
When cops come, my hammer tucked
And I'm all about my money stacks
So I gotta get my sandwich up
That smash, nigga jump off
Let the gun talk, let some off
Then fuck a bitch I got one off

[Hook]

Ridin' the city in a Tony Montana coupe
In a suite with a bad bitch from Santa Cruz

[Hook]

Moral of the story gotta get this paper

The moral of the story, I'm a president, not a mayor
Roll up in the shop, I be spendin' paper
Moral of the story, nigga, I be gettin' paper
Moral of the story, if I see your thot I take her
Moral of the story, that bitch rape me, I don't rape her

[Chorus]
These niggas ain't official (nah!)
Real nigga ain't in him (hannn!)
Dope all in the spine (dope!)
Probably why I can't feel 'em
Too much to lose (skrt!)
Probably why I ain't did em'
Gotta ball out for my dead homies
Probably why I ain't with em'
Ridin' around in this Fisker
10 hunnid for this Fisher
Thousand dollars for these Louies (beep, beeep)
These here are official
Ball, ball, ball, foul, give me a whistle
Hoppin' out with that style, these here a ticket

[Verse 1]
Walkin' through the mall, and I'm smellin' like dope
Shoppin' in Gucci, they let me pour drink up
This convo, ain't a ticket? Then I got's to hangup
'Cause I love that blue cheese, like everybody loves Raymond
Come up in strip club, you fuck around get rained up
Go up in my hood, you fuck around get banged on
Loud pipes when I pull off, you can hear it when I swang em'
I'm in this bitch with a black hoodie, black Gucci's, Trayvon

[Bridge]
I parked in a no park and got me a ticket
Told the Lord to excuse me for my sinnin'
Man, I swear these bitches out here trippin'
If I was still in school, I'd have knots all in my Dickies
(Lets get it)

[Chorus]
These niggas ain't official (nah!)
Real nigga ain't in him (hannn!)
Dope all in the spine (dope!)
Probably why I can't feel 'em
Too much to lose (skrt!)
Probably why I ain't did em'
Gotta ball out for my dead homies
Probably why I ain't with em'
Ridin' around in this Fisker
10 hunnid for this Fisher
Thousand dollars for these Louies (beep, beeep)
These here are official
Ball, ball, ball, foul, give me a whistle
Hoppin' out with that style, these here a ticket

[Verse 2]
Free Slick, niggas keep talkin' that G shit
Niggas keep talkin' that sweet shit
Niggas ain't talkin' that street shit
Bitch, my pockets on deep dish
You don't hustle, you don't eat shit
Ride past you like I don't see shit
I let it seek me, I don't seek it

[Chorus]
These niggas ain't official (nah!)
Real nigga ain't in him (hannn!)
Dope all in the spine (dope!)
Probably why I can't feel 'em
Too much to lose (skrt!)
Probably why I ain't did em'
Gotta ball out for my dead homies
Probably why I ain't with em'
Ridin' around in this Fisker
10 hunnid for this Fisher
Thousand dollars for these Louies (beep, beeep)
These here are official
Ball, ball, ball, foul, give me a whistle
Hoppin' out with that style, these here a ticket

Gucci! Louis! BANG



[Verse 1]
I'm in a new whip, you ain't seen it
Finna hit the sprite with the remix (lean!)
All this fuckin' Fendi, I'm the cleanest
I'm so wavy, make a bitch sea sick
I can only pipe a bitch if she thick
Pistol beat like Bankroll & D. Rich
Two grand on these LV kicks
Couple hundred horse power, eat this
Okay, you niggas wanna sneak diss
Chasin' after money leave me sleepless
Type of nigga fall off for a weak bitch
I took her to the crib, let her eat this
Billie Jean told a bitch to Beat It
Ugh, how she let a nigga beat it
Would've told her she'll make a good parent
Until she swallowed my semen

[Chorus]
I told y'all I was gon' ball
I told y'all I was gon' shit, no stall
I told your girl, I was gon' call
But here her number back 'cause it ain't happen at all
I told y'all I was gonna rock designer
I told y'all I was gonna get them bands
And if you wanna get super fuckin' rich
Then only thing you need to stop fuckin' with is friends
I told y'all I was gonna eat good
I told y'all I was gonna make it out the hood
I told y'all I'ma count big racks
Hop in my lane and I'm grabbin' the wood
Told yall that I got the Mac, Steve Jobs
All this motherfuckin' horse power, yee-haw!
Bitch, I got bigger guns than T.I
He told y'all that I don't, then he lied

[Verse 2]
I just hit this blunt so motherfuckin' hard
Your bitch just jumped in my motherfuckin' car
I'm authentic, you's a motherfuckin' fraud
And my clip is a motherfuckin' large
If I take the pedal in this foreign
Oh can't you tell 'em, I'm ignorant
Used to be slidin' down St. Lawrence
If we catch you lackin' then we scorin'

[Bridge]
Pull up in that all-white like a nazi
Lookin' out for police and paparazzi
This bitch hotter than a Taki
Told her give me that asap, Rocky
Pull up in that all-white like a nazi
Lookin' out for police and paparazzi
This bitch hotter than a Taki
Told her give me that asap, Rocky

[Chorus]
I told y'all I was gon' ball
I told y'all I was gon' shit, no stall
I told your girl I was gon' call
But here her number back 'cause it ain't happen at all
I told y'all I was gonna rock designer
I told y'all I was gonna get them bands
And if you wanna get super fuckin' rich
Then only thing you need to stop fuckin' with is friends
I told y'all I was gonna eat good
I told y'all I was gonna make it out the hood
I told y'all I'ma count big racks
Hop in my lane and I'm grabbin' the wood
Told yall that I got the Mac, Steve Jobs
All this motherfuckin' horse power, yee-haw!
Bitch, I got bigger guns than T.I
He told y'all that I don't, then he lied

Pull off coming back, turn you into a running back

When I saw you last night I tripped out

[Verse 1]
When I see you, I smile, my brothers like, "What's that?"
And I'm like, "When she leaves my mind she comes right back"
And they're like, "ooh baby, you're tripping in that stack"
'Cause I'm smiling and they know that we didn't have sex
I'll ride with you in my passenger seat
I'll stop seeing women that I see every week
I'll put my guard down and we'll go out to eat
If this was all a dream, I'll see you in my sleep

[Hook]
When I saw you last night I tripped out
'Cause last time I saw you, you was mad right

[Hook]
When I saw you last night I tripped out

Pull up on an opp and let that bitch rip like duru-duh-duh

Scooterska-duh-duh, scooterska-duh-duh, scooterska-scooterska
Pull up on an opp and that bitch rip like

Bitch I got weed, and I got jewels
And I got mines, and I got yours

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]

[Verse 2: Benji Glo]
See I'm riding in that bimmer, in the two seater

In the trap playing with them keys call me Stevie

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Explain yourself, how you sound like me?
The motherfucking Skateboard P
Knowing that you're Milo
Playing games like Cee-Lo
In a tight situation like Speedos
You can have it your way like Carlito
My niggas would be happy to give y'all torpedoes
And have your car twisted like a blunt
For you faggot-ass niggas that like to front
I’m on some BBC Bape shit, I'm on some cake shit
In the kitchen with the heat, making beats in my apron
You hating and you want to erase it
Close your eyes when you know you can’t take it
My flow interrupts your homeostasis
I Rolls-Royce it on a regular basis
You talk street shit, it sound like sweet shit
Straight licorice, you niggas sound ticklish
80K large for the Hermès dream
Purple croc in all your magazines
Hunger strike yourself, look like Celine
Dion, me and my niggas like Freon
Your bitch's on my pecan, she got an ass you can eat on
Try to play tough like the leather on a Vuitton
I hit it 'til I could seat on, try to get her freak on
Ask me to R. Kelly ya and get peed on
I said, "That ain't me, ma'am"
That eight behind me still got the burner
Yes, the enzo is still black like Sojourner
Truth, I might have just loosened a tooth
Spitting what I did in the booth, I’m out, poof

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Carrera, raised in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle era
Water-bearer tell the truth, I dare ya
Ya lie, so eat this whole bottle of these jalapeño peppers
For terror made in America, too live
Fuck the property or give me my props properly
High off life, this high technology, DeVry
I rep Muhammad Ali more like rap-ology
My policy’s not to be dishonestly deprived
So gimme that, gimme that, keep God
Where my city at, I’m like steak and fries but never die
They wanna Ghostface, wanna be me
But they will post-haste follow me into the afterlife
That means you going right after I’ve
But I’m the hero, sort of like Jack Sparrow
So some way, somehow, I have survived
Ha, ha, surprised
Who is he that we see coming over the tides?
In a speed boat, boatload of pride
Fall of Rome, dress-shirted and mastermind tie
He what happens when rapping and avant garde fashion collides
OMG, it's the 'C' from the CRS LOLing at you haters
Tell your BFFs, like

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Yes, Mr. West's turn that new child rebel
Loud as a badass child level
Who need a chorus? We do it Tyrannosaurus
Tyrone, it’s been a year with no phone
Could you explain how high is your zone?
We’ll take the plane, rub his nose in cocaine
There’s hoes in magazines you layin' saying you're lame
And for the hate in advance, pull down your pants
Make ‘em kiss both cheeks like we living in France
Diamonds blue, his business manager’s Jewish
And if I get sued, my lawyers Jews
Some girls do grab the cojones
Say, "You got enough diamonds to at least Sierra loan us"
Brand new Ferraris, I gotta make the donuts
CRS is like a hip-hop Chris’ bonus
Niggas is hating on the internet, I couldn’t tell
I was too busy rapping, G.O.O.D. as hell
I was too busy flying, parasail
To Colette to get the new shit that Paris sell
Tarantino, Da Vinci, getting Benjies
Get half-off of Fendi, half of that’s to Cindy's
Hopped out the spaceship, put my Mork in Mindy
Popped too many corks to let you dorks offend me
Props in New York, but Chi-Town’s the city
Get my groupie hoochies Gucci, Monica Belluccis
Are those the real millionnaires or the bendies?
I’m so ultra, I’m even over Oprah
But let me check your account, haha, no sir



[Hook]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up



[Verse 1]
What the fuck do y’all niggas really want?
I went with realness instead
But all the real niggas I know either crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
Niggas keep asking on whether this dude’s for real or not
I’m not trying to come hard, I’m trying to come me
That’s why these older songs that I used to make I’d release free
What’s the point of rap if you can’t be yourself, huh?
That’s why I come first like my cell phone
I’m a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it’s dumb, that’s the fucking reason I’m doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
‘Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend’s baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
(See, that’s not even right)
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she’s sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That’s not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
’Cause I ain’t Mumford, I ain’t tryin’ to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain’t the coolest but I know I got passion
I got passion!

[Hook]
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find

[Segue]
“Baby, I’m okay” She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m on the edge.” She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m on the edge.” She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m on edge.” Said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”

[Verse 2]
Am I serious? I don’t even know
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable
I ain’t trying, I’m doing, these other rappers are foolish
I got fame, my A&R’s a computer
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My nigga like, “I’d get you MTV if I could, man
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man”
So, I guess we gon' see
I ain’t Curren$y, but if there ain’t money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here
My mom loved to text me Psalm verses
She don’t look at me like I’m the same person
I used to be the sweet one, but things change
And I don’t want her missing a son like Bon’s last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey till I’m grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with no I.D. and No I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be

[Hook]
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
We need to find
We need to find



[Verse]
Now it's the B to the izzo
You know what it is I'mma stunt on the d-low
Watch me get it in, spin in the seat, black as can be
Rolling it up, giving a fuck, like I'm a slut
"Bino that's my baby what he doin out at the club?"
Fuck about your dress code, my dress code is I got a big bank roll
I think so, time to give these niggas something else
Island in the summer best believe that shit ain't common wealth
Smile on her face best believe she wearing nothing else
Watch the sun set that's a feeling that she never felt
We were born free, that's my God given
How a god living? Fantastic, fans spazz when they see  ya man passing
I'm in the Aston Martin, unforgivable blackness beg your pardon
On my Jack Johnson nigga, all my shows sell tix like Boston nigga
Put this on at the cook out, let me see you shmoney
Old school on the XM got your Auntie singing "Hola Hola Ayy"
Hit the dream too hard, I'm the new young god
This the new mixtape, but it's still the same game
How you gon be the don, when Don half my name?
How you gon be the G.O.A.T, when we are not the same?
I be feeling all this money but motherfuck the fame
It's the young Bino, I'm in your bae like Oakland
In my bed out of breath I never been this open
If you niggas can't hear me it's the weed I'm smoking
When I opened up the door I had the manager coughing like
"The hotels charging you a maintenance fee"
Gave that nigga 2 stacks and said I'm here all week
Let me roll OG, let me talk my shit
How you hotter than me? You ain't got no hits
You just got a hot feature
Bare sole on the track so my feet hurt
Do some research, know my origin
I'm the new black, fuck oranges
Yeah, that's that nigga that yall love to hate
Redbone like golden gate
Childish y'all know the name, getting hate from Charlemagnes
Last year things done changed, I was thinking bout killing y'all
I was working all night long, white bitches like King Kong
Getting money my theme song, do whatever I want
Fuck your clique do what I want, fuck your bitch do what I want
Here's some shit you niggas didn't know
Probably wrote your nigga verse
Probably wrote your nigga video
High as fuck on Arsenio
Chosen, now they show my my respect nigga
Frozen, Disney movie round his neck nigga
I told ya, I'm the best right now
From Atlanta where them niggas in your chest like "blow"
Royalty equal sign black philosophers
Became a top 5 cause nobody else was stopping us
They want me Hopsin but I'm popping and getting confident
God forbid we give him props for the job he did
Man his knob need some slobbering
I mean, fuck, do you want more?
I'm killing these niggas and still on tour
Fuck is y'all for?

[Outro]
This is for all of y'all
One day everyone's falling off
So right now we should all ball out
Life's too short to not all out
This is for all of y'all
One day everyone's falling off
So right now we should all ball out
Life's too short to not all out
I don't know what I really need
But I'd rather be smoking weed
I don't know what I really need, yeah
But I'd rather be smoking weed

[Verse 1: RZA]
This Oxycontin carbon monox' and toxic concoction
Collapse your brain cells, they swell from lack of oxygen
Leave the opposition stuck, without a pot to piss in
Hockin', spitting up blood, shark by sharp precision
Dart incision, darkness imparts your vision
Sparks infliction, (Poof) I'm a mad magician
Verbal plasma, verbal scatter, words that shatter
Every atom in your body, now you're anti-matter
Ripping through the data, checked into the doctor
Took his rhyme splatter, cause my mind's faster
You falling down to ground, while I climb the ladder
Too much garbage in your gallbladder, fall flatter
On your face, now you carry by the pall-bearer
Or wear the black suit, eyes all teared up
Oh no, when your ho make a boss lit up
We in the rib with a smirk nigga, all geared up
Childish Gambino or Bobby Digi'lino on the tracks
We breaking more backs that Sammartino, Bruno
We saw more baselines than Juno
Change more law in New York than Mr. Cuomo
Godfather novels I write like Mario Puzo
Master time fix the clocks like I'm Hugo
Hold the weight like nine sumos
Bust shots like John Lugo
You know how the Wu go

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Look sharp, homie give yourself a face lift
High brow, eyebrows on a spaceship
Take sips of that Ace of Spades-es
Saving all my money just to waste on a bracelet
Can't see them haters, we dont give a fuck though
Charge it to the game, keep a lame so cutthroat
Never slip a fast one, the game is so in front of me
Travel 'round the globe, spend and make 'bout a 100 G's
Pack them crowds up, boss like Bowser
Deep pocket poetry, my custom trousers
Thank God they found us, the game was starvin'
I'm clean and concrete, you ass and Charmin
Bobby Digital, do you really think these niggas know shit?
Shopping in Manhattan and I ran into my old chick
Pride is a bitch, I am not a grown up
Tweetin' when I'm 70, these half-dead followers
She look like she Spelman, secretly she Hofstra
Put her in the club, all she wanna hear is Waka
Put her in the crib, all she wanna hear is Waka
She jerk when I move like her old boy popped her
Home is that Outkast, soul like I'm Phonte
Old-school J's like Beyoncé's fiancé
Back on my dumb shit, nigga we the stupidest
Gave them niggas real shit, don't know what to do with it
I did what I did man, did you really see it though?
'Bino hard and fast, niggas sweet and low
American Royalty, family loyalty
We cream of the crop why the fuck would we stop?
She had two sons: both of 'em good grades
Both of 'em rap songs
Where did she go wrong?
Nowhere mama, we just go where the money at
Black Kennedy, where the fuck you niggas at?



[Intro: Chief Keef]
This is Royalty
Bang bang

[Verse 1: Gonage]
I got yo bitch layin' naked 'cross the bed, no rosary
Stackin' up this bread like a baker, Josephine
She wanna refill, so I get that ho a bean
Niggas on the sideline yellin' "Who the fuck is he?"
Bitch I'm @Gonage, you can call me Cody B
Wardrobe overseas, passports all over me
White leather seats lookin' like coca leaf
Everytime I crank up the woofer sittin' on a key
I'm Gucci buckled up, house note on my feet
Linen button-up like I'm walkin' round on the beach
Blind hoes notice me in my Range Rover Jeep
So they wanna come and talk to me like Jodeci
Smokin' in the morning, and when I go to sleep
Blowin' presidential man I think they 'about to vote for me
Any event we party like a frat, no toga sheet
If money ain't the convo, they ain't even 'posed to speak

[Hook: Gonage]
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
In the VIP we champagne-spray shit
I'm in the club lookin' like a bank statement
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit
Broke niggas hate, cause they ain't shit
I'm gettin' to the cash pockets on payment
If you talkin' money, I can make arrangement
Cody

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Cody Bean Senior, pushin' mean ether
You don't know Childish? Nigga, me neither
Eastside Atlanta, flyest nigga in a Waffle House
If it ain't money, man, we ain't got shit to talk about
Kennedy compound, my 20-room house
So big my ex-girls ain't gotta move out
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
My bank account looking like when little kids break shit—"Oooh!"
If I'm breathin' I can handle it
Watching all my dreams get together like an ampersand
Blueprint the new shit, mixtape management
Show these dummies how to do it, all I want's my ten percent
Porsche brand new, passed 'em a cool hundred
Yeah my girl 5'2", even her growth stunted
It's the nigga y'all knew back when I flipped meal cards
Now my meals free when I don't taste the fifth star
We can make arrangements, old money Cambridge
Meetin' with the moguls, make 'em richer and they owe you
It's the kid you used to talk about, I'm watchin' people get up on it
On Worldstar and I ain't have to have a nigga moment
Flow's always cold, keep the whole soul anemic
Never left that hard shit, a nigga's always constipated
Got the change for my cousin on froze, no more movin' weight
Flossin' hard, ice king, no more Finn and Jake
Love or hate you gotta say the hype is something handsome
As long as all of 'em bloggin' I'm living Richard Branson
Shit talk is still talk, haters are my billboard
Used to take the Q home, now I hang with ScHoolboy
So iconic, Black Kennedy this shit
Man I'm so ironic, man this ratchet need a fix
Droppin' new shit and the haters get the splashback
Don't be surprised when he ask you where the cash at

[Hook: Gonage]
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
In the VIP we champagne-spray shit
I'm in the club lookin' like a bank statement
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit
Broke niggas hate, cause they ain't shit
I'm gettin' to the cash pockets on payment
If you talkin' money, I can make arrangement
Cody

[Intro: DJ Drama (Childish Gambino)]
Is it too much to ask for lyrics?
(Alright, alright)
(Royalty has never done a track together)
I mean it's 2014 man, c'mon really
(Well I thought we would get everybody on the same track)
You niggas could learn a lot by now
Watch this
(I'll go first)
Stone Mountain

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Give a fuck about these haters man
I'm the flyest that there's ever been
I'm always reppin' Stone Mountain
You know my show is sold out
You know my smoke is so loud
And still about his business
Stay up out my business
Flow so vicious
When niggas talkin' shit, shut they mouth, that's what this is
I walk up in the party, we took all the bitches
They love how I move, we might need a minute
God damn, Summer looking like son of Sam, I'm killin' niggas
Hang with models and a couple strippers
She love my music so I nutted in her
Damn I'm decent, Liam Neeson
I'm takin' over, you playing sober
Gassed up and you finished last
I'm crying nigga, that's tear gas
Woooh, now I'm flexing
Was that fire? Bitch you guessed it (Oh shit!)

[Hook: Steve G Lover]
I bet you I can make that ass hot
C'mon bae, drop it like a ass shot
Say my sixteen will make that ass hot
Song done, drop it like a ass shot
Boy stuntin' got they ass hot
Go on nigga, drop 'em like a ass shot
Jump on this beat and get they ass hot
Go on girl, drop it like a ass shot

[Verse 2: Steve]
I am, the prince, two cups, always
Our team, got money, we stunt hard, so don't hate
Fall off, no way, we run it, it's too late
We smoke sour, call that flowers
I just blew, a bouquet
My girl, so sweet, like Crème brûlée
But still, she that hood, like red Kool-Aid
We on top, toupée, I got hits, like touché
I just did Rome in one day
I just flew out to Croat-ia
I'm independent man and still doin' major
Young King so flashy got me lookin' like lazers
Atlanta housewife I can make ya like Phaedra
So let's play my, I'mma play ya
Get bands, then head to la playa
My niggas is bias
My brothers the owner, fuck with 'em get higher
G-lover spit fire, that flame is saliva
We're riders that got Nick Cannon's now
Make 'em drop you like Mariah, wassup?

[Hook: Steve G Lover]
I bet you I can make that ass hot
C'mon bae, drop it like a ass shot
Say my sixteen will make that ass hot
Song done, drop it like a ass shot
Boy stuntin' got they ass hot
Go on nigga, drop 'em like a ass shot
Jump on this beat and get they ass hot
Go on girl, drop it like a ass shot

[Verse 3: Swank]
Start her off with gin and tonic, mine's a double
Out in Vegas fool, you know I'm bettin' double
Double your car note, double your mama rent
Ain't shit but house money, I ain't spent a cent
Mo' money mo' problems, yeah that's official
I just throw cash at it, that's my issue, it's hard
So I feed my boo boo hard that moo moo bags until she...
If she need mo', then girl I miss you, bye
But ain't no lookin' back
Cause I know it's a salt pile (you salty?)
I'm goin' Chevy with metallic fuckin' gun style
No door handle, she high  tryna figure how
While my auto mobile looks like Girls Gone Wild
That's top off, nigga drop offs
Slidin' dirty with yo' dame
OG sativa baby, watch ahead for that air plane
Fuck with my money, and I'm at your house like the mail came
You meet the Swank lion, beast mode, untamed

[Hook: Steve G Lover]
I bet you I can make that ass hot
C'mon bae, drop it like a ass shot
Say my sixteen will make that ass hot
Song done, drop it like a ass shot
Boy stuntin' got they ass hot
Go on nigga, drop 'em like a ass shot
Jump on this beat and get they ass hot
Go on girl, drop it like a ass shot

[Verse 4: Fam]
Big homie have you seen her
She got the Dobrev, all white Nina
Packed like Serena, or maybe Trina
Shit I don't know, they both got ass
So of course he came to give you all these courses
And you can't ignore 'em, cause these hoes adore 'em
Words hot, don't slur 'em
I just speak up, so please ho, keep up
Please ho, keep up
Ok, ok, ok, she ain't getting money, no way
I met her on a Monday, but I fucked her back to Sunday
I told her she my Brandy, I'm her one and only Wanya
Till she drove off the driveway in her '97 Hyundai, bitch

[Verse 1]
Little hands, little feet
Tiny heart, tiny beat
Oh, thinkin' 'bout the time we spent falling in love together
I don't wanna leave you, I don't wanna deceive you
But oh, when mama cries from daddy's lies
Oh my, please don't take him away, mama
Don't take him away, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I've had my time, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close

[Verse 2]
All the pain, all the tears
Many nights, many years
This love for me is fading
You waited, but I never came home to you
I've never lied about us
We were never supposed to be together
When you see me with some other one
And they know your son
Oh, please don't take him away
You say you won't but you will, yes you will

[Chorus]
'Cause I've had my time, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close

[Outro]
(Don't take my baby boy)
There was a time before you
And there will be a time after you
(Don't take my pride and joy)
Though these bodies are not our own
Walk tall, little one, walk tall
(I hope I stay close)
(Don't take my baby boy)
(Don't take my pride and joy)
Let me hold you, let me hold you
(I hope I stay close)
Can I hold you?



[Verse 1]
Alright it's Childish baby, Mr. Talk-About-His-Dick-Again
Nerdy-ass black kid, whatever man I'm sick of him
That well-spoken token, who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred, use it 'til it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm, dude, show respect
Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine, I do dimes
If not that, I'm walking out with two fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin' since '83, half of 'em say he gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say
I'm a problem, I'm lame as fuck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish
But people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished
Like, "What is this nigga doin? Rap is for real blacks
I hate that fucking faggot, man, he think that we feel that"
Or "I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about"
You better shut your mouth before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics now or Kid Cudi's? Nigga

[Hook]
Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name?
In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck a backpacker

[Verse 2]
Niggas with OCD, N-W-O
All white like my clothes, CW shows
Nigga got signed, it's an anomaly
No cosign: trigonometry
Man these niggas hate me
"Man, fuck you nigga...fuck you nigga!"
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the Titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
"Super Bass," super face inside a garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame, these kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
He don't give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that payback, comin' on that mace took
I'm comin' on that real shit, I'm comin' on her Facebook
Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick
I do me like a gyno chick, uh

[Hook]
Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name?
In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers



[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]
Turn that beat up for me
Really everything, like the headphones
Yeah, yeah, a little bit louder
No punch, you know that mean that we workin' hard

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, young rich nigga shit, pops was an immigrant
Lifestyle ill legit, but know I own businesses
Started out the trunk, ended up at the dealership
All gold Rollie, black face no blemishes
Legend in my city cause I grind so vigorous
If I show my face west of Texas, that's a big event
Gotta pay me twenty cents just to hear me vent
I'm really out here on some shit, you should take a flick
Ballin' on my own ten toes, so the difference is
I call shots never ask for permission, man
I got a lot of big plans in my vision and
I ain't failed yet, 'bout a dollar hell yes
I'm a problem filled test, it's only getting worse
I swear I'm getting money, I just hope you gettin' yours
I'm killin' niggas solo so you know I'm gettin' more
Now that young Gambino on the chorus, go

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
This is for that real shit, this is for that East side
This is for my bad girls, this is for them good guys
This is for my grandma, this is for that West side
This is for them niggas talkin' shit on a website
Damn I feel good, you ain't feelin' nothin'
This is for my niggas who be livin' dime a dozen
Bino got that good shit, Nipsey got them aces
On some young rich shit, Kennedys with black faces

[Break: Childish Gambino]
Yeah, black faces
My Rollie so racist, all black faces
Obama on that million dollar bill, black faces
Yeah, nigga, black faces
Look, yo I got this
Yo, turn, turn it up a little
Ay, here we go, okay

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
League of my own, swag Geena Davis
Only rapper make 100k on your playlist
Niggas talk on twitter, but in life they don't say shit
My Rollie so racist, all black faces
We the new facet, kill 'em like Jason
Grind in my sleep man a nigga need braces
Wonder what you feelin' like, used to be the nervous type
They ain't mention Bino? Man that shit must be on purpose, right?
Hostile, nigga my style
Kind of flow to paint a picture, Norman Rockwell
I don't eat pasta, everything is low-carb
I don't fly coach now, say I fly Goyard
Leave a face covered in that coast guard
Metaphor Mozart, all we do is tell 'em the truth
M Fox to my people on some family ties
Magazines got black faces when somebody dies
I mean look at Donna Summers, she was tryin' to survive
People wrestle over petty cash
When we should be really cryin' over that one percent
Like we tipped a milk glass
Fuck y'all, I'mma let my grandkids ball
Look to the future, these dudes so last week
See me stuntin' so Conde Nasty
Me and Nipsey on some grown shit, no rent
Own shit, so Jim Crow shit, black faces

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
Ay, nigga, black faces
Black faces
That's royalty, nigga



[Verse 1]
Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there’s coke up my asscrack
Move black girls cause, man, fuck it, I’ll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin’ PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it’s all about the over Es
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird, like "nigga" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin’s 440
Eatin’ Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin’ in the islands, lookin’ for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I’m callin’ it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
Cause I’m a beast, bitch, "grrr" - Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl: fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
“You're my favorite rapper now!” Yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin’ kiss my ass: Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain’t that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?”
I don’t know, all I know is I’m the best one

[Hook]
It’s a bonfire, turn the lights out
I’m burnin’ everything you muthafuckas talk about
It’s a bonfire, turn the lights out
I’m burnin’ everything you muthafuckas talk about

[Verse 2]
You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin’
Fuck that, got goons like an archvillain
I’m from the South, ain’t got no accent, don’t know why
So this rap is child’s play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit: “First of all, you talk white!
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can’t even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that’s a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' "Owwww"
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin’ with a Filipina, at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I’m in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don’t bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I’m screamin’ “What the fuck is up?” like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I’m doin’ this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it: Casey Anthony
These rappers don’t know what to do
Cause all I did was act me like a Looney Tune
And I’ll give you all of me until there’s nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer Camp, bitch



[Refrain]
With a gun in your hand
I'm the boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you

[Verse 1]
If you point a gun at my rising sun
Though we're not the one
But in the bounds of your mind
We have done the crime

[Hook]
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes I can)
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes I can)

[Refrain]
With a gun in your hand
I'm the boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you

[Verse 2]
Every boy and girl all around the world
Knows my nigga's words
But if he's scared of me
How can we be free? Yeah

[Hook]
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes I can, oh)
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes I can, oh)



[Verse 1]
Fiji water and a box of old Raisinets
I got a real taste for dyin' but I ain't do it yet
I tried to watch The Artist with my girlfriend
But instead I lost the battle with some Nyquil
Playing Double Dribble with my older cousin
Now I'm ballin' everyday so dude that's gotta stand for something
But it doesn't change the subject
Man, I'm hustlin', sandals cuttin' up
My ankles, please and thank you
Demons hate you when you angel
Never been to prison, but I serve a sentence
Grind—grind, when you—
I'm sharin' experiments with Seventh Day Adventists
And on the seventh day, I'mma show y'all what the event is
Dollar signs, bottom line
Speak the truth and everybody gon' hate you
Unless it's funny
That's how I used to make money
I don't roll with the old, yeah they want something from me
Why the flow so dummy, why do hoes still love me?
I don't know, don't bug me
On patron or bubbly or power, old culture
Ain't nobody sober
My mama don't drink but she kill me over soda
Damn homie, man you famous like Kony
My cousin bang Camp man (my cousin bang Camp man)
ATLienated myself about a month
Just enough to get, to get my rows in a duck
Just enough to make a faithful man wanna fuck
Girls be tweetin' me their pictures, man I gotta look
And most of 'em couldn't handle the panels in my comic's book
This rapper's book, this writer's book
They kinda shook, it's not a hook
They kinda shook, it's not a hook

[Interlude]
There's an edge to the wind
Cutting into my skin
And the air's like an icicle
As the night starts to fall

[Outro]
Uh, no excuses or apologies
Ain’t no way in hell they ain’t gon' say that I ain't body this
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
Ain’t no way in hell they ain’t gon' say that I ain't body this
Let ‘em know
Uh, no excuses or apologies
Ain’t no way in hell they ain’t gon' say that I ain't body this
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
Let 'em know



[Hook 1]
She want to move to California
She must've fucking lost her mind
She want to move to California
That's how they get you every time

[Verse 1]
She make a movie with her friends
Put it up in a minute
Everybody say it now
Ain't no loop at the minute
Everybody saying
"How, how you do it, you did it?"
I'ma show you what it done
But enough for a finish
Pay attention, you listen
You keep losing your mind
How you want to loop this shit
But looking like a Vine?

[Pre-Hook]
But they no pay for no privilege
Now she broke in Koreatown
In the condo you rented
Better get your percentage

[Hook 2]
In California, oh
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly

[Verse 2]
All the people all around and the follower people
I go watching a "haha," make a girlfriend giggle
Make her feel so official, make it Serena Vista
Supernova, new residual, making money a little
Make the smoker illegal
Make the living illegal
Make the laughing illegal
Make it snap for a people
When you make a movie now
Know you making no difference
It's a tickle on the mind
'Fore me finish your sentence
So go pimp a like on Vine,

[Pre-Hook]
But don't pay for the privilege
Now you broke in Koreatown
In the condo you rented
Better get your percentage
Oh, you broke in Koreatown
In that condo you rented
Better get your percentage

[Hook 2]
In California
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly



First Half
[Produced by Tim Suby]

[Verse 1]
I ain't lovin' these fake hoes, room smellin' like 8 Swishers
Room service like 2K, NBA, I'm ballin', nigga
All them niggas, fallin' like Autumn, nigga
Talkin' shit, I saw them niggas, now their daughter want a picture
Rough ain't it? Fuck famous
Niggas too real, got the most haters
Wrote a story so Stephen Curry: how it feel to be golden?
Why was I chosen?
Hanalei Bay with my bae, what can I say?
I did it, my timin' was perfect, I'm comin', they know it
Becomin' the last great American poet
The flow Lindsay Lohan
Tired nigga, retire nigga
My word is art like a hieroglyphic
What island is this?
Cabernet, I can smell her talk
She wanna swim but can barely walk
She 'fraid of sharks, she'd hate my lawyer
Atlanta, Georgia, got somethin' for yah
I'm doin' somethin', stay wit' it
I sport the Oakland A fitted
Cause it's moneyball and I'm throwin' funny
But all the kids'll go get it
God dammit I'm ill
I got one question for the haters, is your girl on the pill?
I'm playin' though, but like really, really?

Second Half
[Produced by Childish Gambino]

[Interlude]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man, oh man
I got a hook for this, it's like
Ba-b-ba-b-ba-ba
B-ba-b-ba-b-ba-ba
Na-na-di-ma-ma-ma
I love you all the time
Somethin' like that

[Verse 2]
I'm the man forever
They can't let a nigga live cause the life is better
85 everyday, why'd I bring this sweater?
I fell asleep on the beach, tiny pink umbrella
Fell out of my drink, she yellin', "What we doin' tonight?"
50k their first week, you ain't doin' it right
Young Bino best friends with the show promoters
Good year, my career is floatin', it's all me
Cause I stay real, the worst pain, niggas don't feel
Cause they ain't feel a nigga, tried to kill a nigga
But he still went stupid
Silver stones on her and the game so clueless
These niggas ain't us
Hopin' that I diss you back so I can make you famous
I'm just tired of haters
The AK goin' off, sound like cicadas
We the clique all day, man I'm so Decatur
Me and Fam backstage, yeah I know you hate us
But you gotta pay us
Let 'em speak at my peak in the game for a minute
But I don't know how
All these light skinned niggas came back in style
Ye lied to us, pretty girls at my concerts
Flow so cold so you know it was my verse
Stank attitude but I like the way she diddy bop
Puffin' white O's, body bang somethin' Nitty Scott
They want the old Bino so they try to rewind
The new Bino too ahead of his time
In a couple of years, they'll have to say I birthed a couple careers
Chances are I get your boy a couple of ears, you know it

[Outro]
Ba-b-ba-b-ba-ba
Duh-d-duh-duh-d-duh
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh
To love you all the time
I don't have words for this part
But I know it should sound like this
Duh-d-duh-duh-duh-duh
To love you all the time

[Instrumental]



[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna have some, all I want's to have it all
They wanted something different, nigga problem solved
Drunk off the high life, death is when I'll sleep it off
Life's a hangover and this rappin' shit's my tylenol
I could call any girl in my phone right now
Have a pillow in her mouth watch her bite down
She like me cause I'm flier than a kite now
It's funny how I get these write ups on what I write down
Chick on my left arm, she could write The King And I
I'd rather die the truth, these niggas live a lie
Dressed like a gentleman, my mouth is never civilized
See me as a hero, use my little brother's eyes
Always do me like I love self portraits
Now these fake niggas say "Hey" like horse shit
People treat me different but I'm still the same person
I don't know what it means, I just know that it's worth it
I know I'm not perfect, but I am original
Wallet stay healthy: vitamins, minerals
Gotta feed the bitch right, stuff her full of spinach
Facebook messages asking how I did it
No time to respond, time is money, life's a debit card
Spend it on the right shit, these bitches want you overdrawn
Drake with dyslexia, I have gone so far
My life is a green light, I always try and go hard

[Hook]
I am just different

[Verse 2]
I am so different, the game's on lid eye
Listen to my mixtape, change your whole shit up
Salad backstage, I just wanna eat alone
Crowd at my shows more mixed than Rashida Jones
Haters say I'm changin', but I haven't changed at all
Indie kids saying that I've ruined all their favorite songs
Hood niggas sayin' that I'm whiter than that Colgate
Hatin' on my progress, I'm a long ways from Bro Rape
Black Clark Kent, all I need's a Lois Lane
But let her spend the night once and watch her go insane
Voice mail, e-mail, sending text message
We are not engaged just because I made breakfast
Believe me you don't want this, I'm all about business
Life is a bitch, I must be datin' her sisters
Gotta be different, take chances like pictures
Emerge victorious, stunt on ya'll bitches
I'm not at the top, but ya'll niggas know I'm comin' fast
Rap will change after me, all of this will come to pass
Rappers start to use real instruments and shit
Niggas start to copy me, dumb it down and make it rich
I am not a novelty, just the first to do it different
I have always been this good, you were just laughing too hard to listen
Got my career overnighted, maybe you should order one
Springsteen this city cause this city we were born to run

[Outro]
I am just different
I am just different
I've always been different
I am just different



[Intro: Adele]

Childish Gambino got that swagger
All these pussy niggas 'round here don't matter
All that I know is that I wanna dance with ya
Move in closer before I'm gonna kiss ya
Know that you know me, don't act stupid
You seem different, tired of these groupies
I'm on fire, won't find figga
Got big shots saying, "That's that nigga"
Hovy with glasses, Weezy but geeky
Girls in the lobby tryin' to meet me
I ain't afraid to say it, yeah I love these hoes
And their glasses, and their jacket, and their hipster clothes
Yes, I'm always on tour, what you mad at that for?
Slamming that thing like a Cadillac door
I love fast women, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Have your cake and eat it, baby it's your birthday

[Hook]
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya

[Verse 2]
"It ain't tricking if ya" you know, "baby, I" you know
Mama, you are with the right man, Juno
Tell me what you wanna do, I will make it happen
I just wanna get you home and uh, uh, uh, uh, oh
Yes, I'm drinking whiskey, baby I am gone tonight
NBC is not the only thing I'm coming on tonight
Gross, why the fuck I say these things?
It isn't over, haven't heard the chubby lady sing
Everybody love me, call a nigga Raymond
These weak niggas always in your face like Raybans
Yes, I bring the heat, girl, fire for fireman
Baby, I'm your hero, Donald for Spiderman
I'm in love with you, but this is not tennis
And baby stay stacked like she bad at Tetris
Rude boy, I Rihanna that vagina
Tell your boy, good luck tryin' to find ya, find ya

[Hook]
Baby girl, you know what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya
Let me do ya like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Part 1: Dream]

I had a dream I ran Atlanta, and I was on every radio station. And 107.9 was 97.5 again. And they played me at Golden Glide on Friday. And they played me real loud on the street, we drive up Memorial Drive, up Wesley Chapel. I reopen 112, and Jazzy T's. I'd bring back Turner Field. I fire all the cops in Cobb county. Chick-Fil-A will be open on Sundays. I bring back LaFace Records, Freaknik. Kilo Ali, Lou. I got J.R. Crickets some Spelman girls with big booties. I reopen SciTrek, strippers will get Mother's day off, and I'd have my own Gangsta Grillz mixtape
[Part 2: Southern Hospitality]

[Intro]
Hey this is Steve Smith from American Dad, and this is Royalty
STONE MOUNTAIN

[Intro: DJ Drama]
This what y'all been waiting for?
In Gambino we trust! (Gangsta!)
R O Y A L T Y is forever
DJ Drama is forever (Gangsta grizzilz!)
Y'all ready?
Gambino.. (yea)
Get em!

[Verse 1]
(I ain't no snitch, cops I don't trust 'em
I ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em) (x2)
Nigga I was stunin', keep that shit a hunnid
If it ain't about the money then it's not up for discussion
If it ain't about-

[Break: DJ Drama]
After selling out the Georgia Dome 3 nights in a row, after selling 10 million copies of his newest album, Roscoe's Wetsuit, in one week. After successfully petitioning to recarve his own face into Stone Mountain (Stone Mountain), he's still givin' you niggas a free mixtape! Why Gambino, why young guy? Why so generous?

[Verse]
I ain't no snitch, cops I don't trust 'em
I ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em (It's R O Y A L T Y!)
Nigga I was stunin', keep that shit a hunnid
If it ain't about the money then it's not up for discussion
If it ain't about progress, ain't about success
Why this nigga suspect?
You ain't seen sus yet
I'mma fuck the game so hard like Tiff
Niggas takin' shots, I'm like "nigga don't tempt me"
I seen what you make, yeah them shows sold out
But you doing clubs and I'm doing like all out, things
Why the hell he rapping if he all out sings
Royalty the movement, we all out kings
For real, Bino on a mission
We are not friends, nigga this is business
Girl this my dream, ain't no split decisions
Watch me cut this bitch off, I'mma need some scissors
Mama in the kitchen, hot sauce on them chitlins
I was always spittin', just that no one else was listening
Got your girl and now we kissin'
She attracted to my vision
Now she see what she was missin'
Now she act a little different
Telling you she need some distance
Yeah come on over, we can talk about it
Now this nigga mad, yeah he thought about it
But he don't really want it
Semen on her stomach
That's a second coming, Jesus
Flow so genius, can't low-key this
Puffin' on a swisha like a ho smoke penis
They want me Uncle Remus
But I'm just flexin' on 'em
[Part 3: Partna Dem]

[Intro]
This on some old Atlanta shit. But I like it cause, it's not about what you know, but who you know. Know what I'm saying?

[Verse]
Royalty my partna dem
No one else might partna dem
Stay strapped with that arsenal
These niggas winnin', it's hard to tell
Move over, we about to take over
Slide up in them DMs, her nigga didn't even notice, I'm focused
I'm the man of the hour, play me on Power
Play me on Hot, nigga I'm hot, nigga don't stop
Flow so cold put a cherry on top
Haters so mad, he ain't even know why, probably all the autonomy
Fuck all your feelings, I'm proud of me, head was so good it's psychology
God damn, I'm just being who I am
From that weird ass little kid to this ballin' ass grown man
Man this beat is going so HAM, flow been burr since Novem'
Chain been burr since Novem', that means cold, I'm just sayin', we ain't playin'
If your man don't want to lick it I volunteer as tribute
You niggas on them Hunger Games, I'm eating O's like onion rings
I kill them hoes so constantly
I ain't even gotta sugar coat it
See them titties, wanna motorboat it
I'm Dopaliscious like Spottie Ottie
Y'all don't know me, run the world
Turnin' up like that little girl, like
Ay-Ay-Ay-Turnup!
Tell them niggas it's tax season
Atlanta Georgia, that's black Sweden
I'm such a martyr, die for the game
I'm such a MARTA I'm runnin' trains like whoo
Slow that shit, felt that shit
Let me hear it



[Hook: Childish Gambino & Janet Leon]
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high
Firefly

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Skateboardin' down at Washington Square
Lookin' for quarters
Maybe afford a falafel for dinner, ugh
I’m so broke man, scholarship apologin'
Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin'
Girls like, "we love you, we go to LSU
You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you"
This rap stuff is magic
I used to get called "Oreo" and "Faggot"
I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at
"Oh, you got a mixtape? That's fantastic"
But everybody thought it was jokes though
They half right, the joke is
I got flow so don't act like
You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be
I know Donald Glover, he weak man, he campy
I'm still knocked down, but I up the ante
Me and hip-hop, that black Sid and Nancy, let 'em know

[Hook: Childish Gambino & Janet Leon]
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high
Firefly

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
It's hard to make Hov the footsteps you followin'
Especially when your niggas look like Carlton
The pretty girls usin' skin so soft
Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off
Nigga you act too soft
Fuck you! I'm from the projects
My mom was just workin' to give me options
No live shows, cause I can't find sponsors
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert
"Yeah so, whatcha gonna do man?
You won't speak to the hood, man"
If I was given one chance I think I could, man
These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't cause they embarrassed
All I do is make the stuff I would've liked
Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And you's a fake fuck like a fleshlight
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy
Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet Jay-Z?
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough
Now text me pics sayin', "You could tear this up"
I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry
But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me
Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be
Now everyone sing the chorus man, you do it so beautifully

[Hook: Childish Gambino & Janet Leon]
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high

Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high



[Hook]
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all

[Verse 1]
Tell em what it is, I'm takin great strides
Hood niggas, hipsters, I ain't trying to take sides
Ex-Girlfriend on my mind, she really fucked me up
Doing shots of whiskey 'till my friends are saying thats enough
I really really miss her, sometimes I wanna fuck it all
Mix some warm Guinness with 20 tablets of tylenol
Call 'em while I'm drifting off, tell her that I love her so
Parents crying harder cause I didn't even leave a note
Saying that I'm selfish and I'm sorry that I left
But it hurts so much to wake up and I left you guys a check
Cause I ain't fucking happy, you don't know shit about me
I think it started when she said she happier without me
I really can't blame her cause I'm happier without me
I don't see what girls are seeing when they say they're all about me
I'm scared they wanna trap me, these all hoes are all liars
I double bag my shit and never cum while I'm inside her
I used to be a sweet dude, now I'm so angry
Look at what these girls and these fake niggas made me
Cry when I'm writing, I don't really know why
I think its cause I can't really see myself an old guy
And that scares me, I wanna be around a while
But I feel my purpose goes beyond having raised a child
Bright lights, they tend to burn out fast
So I shine bright, But I'm scared that it won't last

[Hook]
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, Imma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all

[Verse 2]
I'm just about the pop, the industry just noticed it
People watching me, I feel like Amber Rose's tits
Friends of mine are over it, people say I changed
And I tell them that I'm glad, cause I don't wanna stay the same
Cause I used to be poor, I used to be unconfident
I used to hate these haters, now its just the opposite
Not only have I changed, I'm becoming something better
And revenge is for the weak, so I have settled my vendettas
With all of the kids who made my early life a living hell
And I hope you're doing well and feeling better 'bout yourself
Don't know if you can tell, but change is usually for the better
I used to like these bitches but couldn't afford to get em
But now I'll take your girl, yeah player pay homage
That's why I fuck these bad mamas, Kate Gosselin
I'm trying to tell the world I'm nothing to be trifled with
Donald Glover staying hotter than some rifle spit
They only wanna fuck with you after you made your way
But when you started out you couldn't pay em to stay
But now I got em lined up in the lobby door
It makes me wonder what this rapping shit's a hobby for
Oh thats right, because I'm gifted in another field, and another field, and another field
They say my public persona don't have enough appeal
I take a lesson from Kanye and give em something real
I'm getting all this attention I wanna do it right
That's why I'm performing for you like every single night
To all my fans who's saying Donald Glover about to blow
Just give me six months so you can say I told you so

[Hook]
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, Imma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all

You know I was tossing that green
We ain't even on the same team
We ain't even hit her with the real shit
I'mma show these mother fuckers you ain't really seem real
Aaw, I'mma do it for the real niggas
When them boys ain't feeling ya
Real only see real nigga
Heard of Bino man that boy amazing
You don't hear me cause a nigga blazing, blazing
Oh you don't want a problem
You don't want yo' man to solve 'em, naw

[Hook]
I came here to do my own shit
I came here to do my own shit
No fucks given
No fucks given

[Verse 2]
I'm killin' these niggas off a mixtape
And most these niggas out been fake
Me and my niggas all homeless
We ain't hear shit that y'all told us
We was getting money, you ain't getting money
All we did was study, all we did was study
We don't give a fuck about status
Girls and you know I got baddest
Just cut her off, she the saddest
Wish a nigga would like Aladdin
No chill, dress code I'm like "oh well"
She ain't seen my hotel
Man them numbers don't bode well
War is hell
This ain't war but I'm beefin' nigga, my ether nigga, wooh
I don't fuck with the fake shit
More green than a spaceship
We don't fuck with y'all, no way
Y'all ain't got no taste
Rap is not bold face
Now we in the mix
If you broke we can fix it
Sayin' I ain't doing things, look at this shit
Look at this shit, look at this shit

[Hook]
I came here to do my own shit
I came here to do my own shit
No fucks given
No fucks given



[Verse 1]
I am the shit
I hold heat like cigarettes
No one else is doing this
Work this hard you get respect
I don't sleep, I dream awake
Swear this life's like make or break
I don't make I fix mistakes
Your life good, my life is great
This game is a bitch and I'm different, dude
I'm tryin' to fuck this bitch, she ain't in the mood
Seduce her quick
Everyone talkin' bout game needs change ain't changin' shit
Talk don't make it happen
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Too tight need muscle relaxer
I'm what's next, just ask 'em

[Hook]
All I know
It's what I came for
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah
All I know
It's what I came for
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah

[Verse 2]
I wanna do this right
Leave my heart on stage when I hold a mic
And the game OT, no end in sight
So I write in my sleep, I don't say good night
This must be how the angels felt
I hope that I don't Corey Haim myself
I know that I drink an insane amount
Cuz it helps with the joy and the pain of wealth
These guys don't seem like the friends I need
And they hang backstage drinking beers for free
My mom and my dad in the balcony
The one time that I hope they look down on me
Cuz they proud of me
They call me a role model
Even though my hand's glued to that gin bottle
I keep my career going full throttle
Even though the pain will follow

[Hook]
All I know
It's what I came for
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah
All I know
It's what I came for
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah



[Intro]
Yo I want to give a special shout out to DJ Drama, for letting me do this
I really appreciate it (And it's like this)
Hey go DJ! (That's my DJ!)
Hey go DJ! (That's my DJ!)
Hey go DJ! (Uhh, yeah, uhh)

[Verse]
Stuntin' 101, I'm doing shit that ya'll never done
Talking from TVs and movies, these the choppers to Uzis
Nothing can bruise me, nigga this is more than a movement
My squad is forever, we ain't getting annulments
New song on your speakers got me getting enormous
Played a performance, niggas getting paid on performance
A lot of ya'll hate cause my women is gorgeous
I mean they a work of art, something out of a portrait
I mean I'm a work of art, all my verses is poetry
Niggas is different, you chicken, we ain't fucking with poultry
Bunch of crab ass bloggers got me allergic to shellfish
If I fell off in a day, man, these niggas be helpless
I be bringing on a plane 'till you lames get mailed it
It's ROYALTY and, nigga, I'm the king like Elvis
I don't talk about it, let them niggas conversate
What's the song about it? Give her D and smoke a J
We don't play, I'm so on a bench, money is the stench
Let me vent, I'mma smoke 'em out, circles from her mouth
What's my favorite sound? "Oh my God I'm cumming"
Second favorite sound? "Oh that sound like money"
Oh that sound like freedom
Oh that sound gon' need a feature but he didn't need him
I'm coming back like Jesus, color Reeces Pieces
That's the money down here, we gon' need a Visa
Bread like he Anita
That's my DJ, thank you DJ Drama
Came in this bitch like my baby mama
I believe in karma so I run the summer
All I got is checks, check out all these commas!
Check out how I'm eating, it is very cool
James White a nigga, man I'm such a fool
I'm doing me so cold, this nigga spitting so cold
His girl 20 years old, she know she 'bout to get choose
That rabbit hole, I'm talking shit, but I'm rapping though
And that IRS and I'm taxing hoes and I saw the check
And said "add some o's, add some o's!"
Why my clique so animal? Why my clique so Set It Off?
And I'm Queen Latifah you know I'm eatin', I fucked it up
Niggas think we ain't tough enough, niggas think we was born rich
Niggas thinking a lot of shit, niggas don't know a wars coming
Niggas don't know I saw something, killing trees, Paul Bunyon
Bunyon foot, foot clan, klans man... Alamo
Stream of conscious, I don't know
Flow was done a long time ago, and I feel for niggas who save a ho
I ain't got time and I'm throwing up like gang signs
But that was not the case
You niggas wish your lifestyle was nice as my place
I'm eating off these white kids, I don't need their plate
We burning down that blue dream, she sitting on my face
I'd leave it on her backside, but that'd be a waste
That be a waste, that be a waste

[Hook]
I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you
I got this Sunday, baby, I wanna spend it with you
We can do what you like, I promise then, I'll be true
I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you, oh

[Verse 1]
I don't really know where to go, don't know where to hide
Everywhere that I go, you'll be right by my side
You're the only girl that I have ever dreamed of
I wanna tell you everything, but everything just seems dumb

[Pre-Hook]
I kinda like you, girl, really wanna dress you up
I wanna buy you for real
I kinda like you, girl, really wanna feel you up
I wanna feel you for real

[Hook]
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you

We can do what you like. I promise then, I'll be true
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you
Oh

[Verse 2]
I got an upstairs, downstairs in my loft
Check the mixtape, baby. I don't talk
Yes, I run this shit, like it's hard to walk
And you think that I'm dope, like a mound of chalk
I'm recession proof. I work to relax, ho
Weird voice catch beef like a lasso
New fresh prince, you can chill in my castle
Spit real shit, so I must be an asshole, right?
Nah, that's why I'm makin' out in your car
These blogs are a dude's A&R
Got a big tip for these girls at the bar
But I don't mean money
Ever since the money, they just treat me funny
Girls look good, she can take green from me
Ain't trickin' if you got it, know what I mean, buddy?

[Bridge]
You've got your yellow sun dress on
I'm tryna write you the best song
With your Wayfarer shades, you drive me insane
I wanna hold hands, and call you pet names

[Pre-Hook]
I kinda like you, girl, really wanna dress you up
I wanna buy you for real
I kinda like you, girl, really wanna feel you up
I wanna feel you for real

[Hook]
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you
I got this Sunday, baby. I wanna spend it with you
We can do what you like. I promise then, I'll be true
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you
Oh



[Hook]
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find

[Verse 1]
You got the power, you got the power
Of every hour,  of every hour
I come to getcha and I know where you are
I come to getcha and I know where you are
It's getting hot, it's like a sauna
Then every night, in Arizona
They come to getcha when they grope in your mind
They think you creepy, getting down in your mind
They come to getcha, they come to getcha
It doesn't matter, you making magic
I got the business to make a mind
I got the business to make a mind
And if you feel it, if you feel in your toes
And you act nothing like nobody knows
But if you want it, you got to want it

[Hook]
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word

[Verse 2]
Come on baby, oh
Darling no, no, no, no, no, no, no
That's right baby, that's right
I see wherever, wherever, wherever you are
(Wherever, wherever, wherever you are)
I see wherever, wherever, wherever you are
(Wherever, wherever, wherever you are)
Wherever, wherever, wherever you are
(Wherever, wherever, wherever you are)
Do no wrong now
That's right baby

[Bridge]
There's a big wide world out there, I need to get in
We have got to really stay together (we gotta stay together)
And I hope and I pray, we will find it someday
We have got to really stay together (are we staying?), so—

[Hook]
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find



[Hook]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 1]
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
The text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'm-a flirt with this new girl
And I'm-a call if it don't work
So we fuck till we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losing
I'm a ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
Cause

[Hook]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 2]
It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome--good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she wanna play games
With the Super Smash Brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smoke
And light

[Hook]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 3]
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his post on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you ate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money, then you burn me, then you made off
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, "What the fuck you hiding?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something? In between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that

(But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it’s fuckin’ awesome)



I wanted you to know

[Hook]
Yeah, yes, I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop
Yeah, yes, I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop

[Verse 1]
Cheezy wassup!
Let me hear you holla, bitch
Actor, writer, rapper, nigga, I do all of it
Lactose tolerant; addicted to cheddar
And I spent it on a jacket, man, I don't know no better
Yeah, it's Childish Gambino, yeah I'm fly as a feather
Yeah, my nigga be suburban but my flow keep it ghetto
Keep my swagger Polaroid, you can watch it develop
Ain't it funny? In a year I went from different to special
Yeah I got it together, yeah, I took those chances
Labels on me like I might cause cancer
Yes a nigga flow went from Camry to Phantom
I'm just talking real shit, hoping you can handle
Sleeping on the jet like "lier" like chandle
Flyer than a jet women, hoping they can land him
How we turn everything to gold that they hand 'em?
I am just different, that's the only answer

[Hook]
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop

I'm a hero
I'm a hero
I'm a hero
I'm a hero
I'm a hero
I'm a hero
I'm a hero
I'm a hero, yeah

[Verse 2]
Back on my grind, nigga I'm a skater
She just think I'm fine, nigga you's a hater
Style with no name, they just want to label me
They should call it what these other niggas are afraid to be
APC store walkin' out with eight bags
Yeah I'm killin' paper, call it poppin' tag
You ever spend three grand on designer vision
When you should really spent it on your little sis tuition?
She played my album when nobody else out there would listen
I'm comin' harder than these girls that you would swear were pissin'
Davinci-esque, I'm the real deal
The only thing I don't know is how fake feel
I'm living everything these other niggas lyin' bout
Bitches don't believe me, to prove it to em I fly 'em out
She say that I'm her everything, I'm better than those other guys
I say "I'm just a rapper." She tell me "That's a fuckin' lie."

[Hook]
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop

I'm a hero, I'm a hero
I'm a hero, I'm a hero
I'm a hero, I'm a hero
I'm a hero, I'm a hero, yeah

[Verse 3]
They said me rappin' was like MJ and baseball
But that would make me MJ, so motherfuck all of y'all
Trippin' on this fame shit, drinking like a fuckin fish
Listen to the next track, "I be on that other shit"
Yes I sound weird, nigga, take it as a compliment
Guess who's in the house and representing like a congressman
Anything I put my mind to I accomplish it
From writing scripts with Tina Fey to laying down the hardest shit
Who else is doing what I'm doing? No one
And I mean girls too, intended no pun
I'm on the road son, busy like I'm Bone Thug
Comment left anonymous cause ain't nobody want none
She laying in my bed she gotta be bi-curious
Barf on the track, be amazing and rap-furious
Damn bloggers argue whether or not I'm serious
It's Nas' Illmatic not Eddie Murphy's Delirious
Got the limelight, you stupid you think I'm sharing this
Showing up late, promoters wondering where he is
Got some nightmares, but failing's gotta be scariest
But I would never fail, I'm a hero one of the best there is

[Hook]
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop

I'm a hero

[Hook]
Ooh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my hand
I'll hold you down, oh
Ooh, you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, oh
Yeah, uh
Why in the fuck these niggas
Try and hold me down, ohh

[Verse 1]
"You such a fuckin' lame!"
It's what they used to yell back in seventh grade
My momma said she'd get me that new jacket
When the cost go down
Hit the office, stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found
Not bad for a family of foster child
Lookin' fly man, I'm flossin' now
But them niggas saw through me
"Are you serious? What is this?"
Took the jacket off third period, ellipsis
Listening to "Sky Is the Limit" on my Walkman
Thinking if Biggie can make it through it, man then I can
Dope-boy swag, I always wanted that
But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe
But no love for the son of a commuter who was a radio head
And okay at them computers at the post office
It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins
All my people need throat lozenge
My fear is dead, ambition drove the hearse
But niggas got me feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church
Culture shock at barber shops cause I ain't hood enough
We all look the same to the cops, ain't that good enough?
The black experience is black and serious
Cause being black, my experience, is no one hearin' us
White kids get to wear whatever hat they want
When it comes to black kids one size fits all

[Hook]
Ooh, you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, oh
Yeah, uh
Why in the fuck these niggas
Try and hold me down, ohh

[Break]
We the baddest nigga
We the baddest nigga, you hear me?
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest

[Verse 2]
The reason that they say I'm nothin' what they seen or heard's
The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls
They only see you how they wanna see you
'Til you make them see you in some other way
I'm trippin' off the other day
Cause God knows what these white kids say and do
Dude you're not not racist
Cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue
Subtle racism, it's hard to pin it cause you'd only understand
If you were me for just a minute
This one kid said somethin' that was really bad
He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad
I think that's kinda sad, mostly cause a lot of black kids
Think they should agree with that
If you're a father, you should stick around if you could
Cause even if you're bad at it, you could Tiger Woods or MJ
We warriors, we all need senseis
Change everything that we've done so far
I don't mean makin' B.E.T. T.E.R
I mean just the way that we see each other
I won't stop until they say:
"James Franco is the white Donald Glover"
Yeah, these niggas wanted Cookie
But instead I gave 'em Loch Ness
Sick Boi for life, my swag is in a hospice
Aimin' for the throne, Jay and Ye said to watch that
They ask me what I'm doin', I say I'm stealin' rock back
Nigga

[Hook]
Ooh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my hand
I'll hold you down, oh
Ooh, you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, oh
Yeah, uh
Why in the fuck these niggas
Try and hold me down, oh
Ooh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my hand
I'll hold you down, oh
Ooh, you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, oh
Yeah, uh
Why in the fuck these niggas
Try and hold me down, oh



[Verse 1]
I be on that other shit, I'm harder than a consonant
And that's because I'm flyer than the mothership, you ostrich
I'm awesome rich. Call a bitch. Fresher than my lozenges
The problem is you in the Danger Zone like Kenny Loggins is
I'm fly, I'm tight. They say I'm sick: they right
You think you good, I swear I put your shit to bed, good night
Yes, I'm sitting on the bench cause I don't play no games
I just spit that Bellevue, watch them go insane
Why these mothafuckas think they waking up in pain
Cause they sleeping on the hardest nigga in this game
Hell yes, I'm on that zombie shit, I must get brain
They will not forget me like I was hit by planes
I ain't got to do it big, I just gotta do it different
And these hoes are on my dick, and if you got it, it ain't tricking
I be steady getting paper, call a nigga Dunder Mifflin
And these rappers cannot see me, I'm the only one with vision

[Hook]
I be on that other shit
I be on that other shit
I be on that other shit
And you can't handle none of it
I be on that other shit
I be on that other shit
I be on that other shit
And you can't handle none of it

[Verse 2]
I'm on top of turd mountain: King shit, bitches
Can't nobody top that: Teen Witch, bitches
I don't make it rain, I bring the heat storm, nigga
Weezy F is in jail, I keep his seat warm nigga
Yes, I get it like I live it. Yes, this pimp is still is pimping
Y'all don't want me to be different. What the fuck is y'all thinking?!
That does not suit me, call it Ben Sherman
Cause I get more green than Kermit, heard me
I'm in charge of new shit, don't talk, do shit
Spitting at the crowd like I play heavy metal music
I can say anything, call me John Cusack
Keep my dick wetter than the bottom of a cruise ship
Keep it fresh to death, Keep my swag inside a coffin
So fly, I'm in the sky like Vodka, partner
Shout out to Marc Jacobs. Yeah, my feet be feeling highbrow
And Band of Outsiders, got your tie on right now
Glory versus failure. There is nothing to it
Cause you win some and lose some, Sandra Bullock
Tell me when I'm way too much, when no one had faith in us
They thought Child was child's play, but now, they see we dangerous
Bring your girl around and let me show her how her body work
She like me cause my wallet fat, it should wear a Hawaiian shirt
Comin' for your spot, like I do when I'm inside of her
Got the cold, hard green in my hand, no Heineken
Listen up. Listen up, please. Check my steez
Insect ligaments, I'm the bee's knees
Watch my math, like 75 minus 6
How can number 2 be number 1? Because I'm the shit, bitch

[Hook]
I be on that other shit
I be on that other shit
I be on that other shit
And you can't handle none of it
I be on that other shit
I be on that other shit
I be on that other shit
And you can't handle none of it

(Who am I?)
Rec League, I ain't paying to ball
Y'all B-string like a broke guitar
And I still put it down like the family dog
Yeah, I murder some, I murder one
Explain it all, Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah, what you saying to it?
Old money look, no money don't do it
Make 'em turn around in their lane like a U-ey
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty
(At her booty) What's the rationale?
They wanna smoke niggas when they black & mild
So we acting out—okay, cool

[Hook: Kai]
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Blue dream by the bouquet
'Til I'm blue-faced on a Tuesday
Can I have some?
"#NiggasBeLike", put a +18 on an e-vite
And I said what I felt, no re-write
Nah, nah, they can't hold me
June, July—drop something
I double dare you, I'm Marc Summers
I scorch winters, I burn autumns
Gut niggas, so Kurt Vonne
Elle Varner, got a crush on her
I gotta wait in line for that
Ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that
Too true like it's 2 Chainz
Blue blood like he both gangs

[Hook: Kai]
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone

[Intro]
"I had a dream... I had a dream I was flying over all of us. There were so many pretty people, so many pretty faces. I talked to some birds, I fell in love again, and none of this ever ended. Everything just kept going, and going, and going. And even when you laughed, you cried. And even when you were sad, you were really happy. Cause you were here. And I got to meet every star, every planet, everything that made me. And we all kissed, and became the same. We became the same. We became the same."

[Verse 1]
Who would have thought this, we almost lost it
When you lie inside darkness, it's hard to see
And we sleep in tradition, keep 'em off in the distance
To tell you that I haven't been

[Pre-Hook 1]
We are all cold water
Why try at all? Why bother?

[Hook]
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling

[Verse 2]
Who would have dreamed this?
You couldn't mean this
It would be some type of meanness to where you are
Cause I don't know where to go
And no one else seems to know

[Pre-Hook 2]
We are all night's fallen
Why try at all? Dark calling
So we're left alone, no one left to call upon
Be still now, broken bones, as I travel on

[Hook]
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling

[Outro]
So we're left alone, no one left to call upon
Be still now, broken bones, as I travel on
Just hold me close, my darling

Rainbows, sunshine, everywhere we go
Rainbows, sunshine, go

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine, yeah
Rainbows, sunshine

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
I thought I told you 'bout it (act like you know)
(Act like you know, act like you know)
You don't leave home without it (move that kilo)
(Move that kilo, move that kilo)
She on my back about it (C3PO)
(C3PO, C3PO)
And all the time (act like you know)
Oh oh, yeah (Act like you know, act like you know)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
How could you ever question? They know better to mention
The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention
The who, what, why and where, they sport the flyest pairs
She got the nicest hair and she know life is better with this nigga
It's crazy how the world look different
It's crazy how the girls look different
The colors and the sounds so vivid
You never catch your boy po-pimpin'
Me sittin' on the sidewalk, now that don't sound right
But as long as I look fly by prom night—go

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Rainbows (ho!) sunshine
Rainbows (ho!) sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine, yeah
Rainbows, sunshine

[Interlude]
Jhene Aiko's angelic harmonizing

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
He slangs, his yay, through the corridors
Every day, 20K, yep, at the very least for sure
And they say there's no way
I should stay with someone like you, but I tell them no
There's no way I could stray
Gotta stay with someone like you
Cause I know one day
You could take me away, far away
I know you could pay
All the money you made, there'll be plenty of sunshine

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
I never worry 'bout it (act like you know)
(Act like you know, act like you know)
I have my nigga count it (back up them O's)
No no (back up them O's, back up them O's)
She's dressed up in gold (dressed up in gold)
(C3PO, C3PO)
I'm out of time (act like you know)
Oh no no no (act like you know, act like you know)

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
I'm out of time, oh no no
Out of time, oooh
I'm out of time, out of time
La-la-la, la-la-la (go)

[Intro]
Oh, we gon' have a party
All my friends will be there
We drink all the vodka
There's music everywhere
Now wait a minute (Wait a minute!)
Do you like to party?
Cause if you don't
Don't come over here
We got smoking, Blue Dream
Drinking, cocaine, fucking
I wanna show you what it is

[Verse]
Thought I was done but that wasn't the case
Got a new stack that I threw in your face
Got a new girl and she look Mila Kunis
Infinity pool, and a statue that's Buddhist
Got bottles and bottles and bottles of Grino
Saw I was rich, now they fucking with 'Bino
Brown leather bag, the vacation Messina
The boat in the harbor, I rule the marina
10K for the drinks, now they say I'm insane
It's been that for a minute, now Hedi Slimane
I been black, lucrative, since Danity Kane
Who came back for a minute, now everything changed
High as a kite, lime in the light
Y'all niggas might whine every night
I ain't invite all these people to my mothafuckin' house
"Get the fuck out of my house!"

[Outro]
Yo, chill—
Hey, chill, man!

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
At a Clippers game on the courtside
Watch a nigga shoot like a four-five
They mad at me too, I got more fire
When these bitches see you "Go home, Roger" (Go home, Roger)
Tia and Tamara in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate, instead of asking what's happening
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playing PlayStation
Why you standing there, say some, girl, say some
No, this ain't a vacation, this is my house, my house

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Bought a new bath, 8K, nigga
Wanna take shots? AK, nigga
When I ball, I'm-a ball King James, nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around when you want to play pool in my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a ménage, and murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I-I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I-I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors...

[Chorus: Childish Gambino & Chance The Rapper]
All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...

See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
When the world was discerned with this and that
I was young, didn't know to hold it back
Now we here and the world is something else
We could leave any day you call for help
We were gods, nobody was above me
That "A" on my chest like adultery
That "A" on my chest, put your fist up
That "A" on my chest like a chipmunk
Alvin, Theodore, breathe in, breathe out, mi amor
Breathe in, breathe out, nevermind
It was time, number nine, lies
Feline with a deathwish
E-vite didn't help shit
No name on the guest list
Hold on, we were destined

[Hook: Azealia Banks & Childish Gambino]
See now I don’t wanna see an era (no), an era (no), an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it’s the last night
(You and me)
Maybe it’s the last night
(Fireworks)
Maybe it’s the last night
(Oh, all the stars)
Maybe it’s the last night
(Super moon)
Maybe it's the last night

[Bridge: Azealia Banks]
All that I have
All I don't have's the future
Take on my soul
All night

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Yeah, break free from all of the insides
They godless, denied us
But we don't give a, about the next day
We were never here, never know if the world change
Common sense, the consequences
Retweet the truth then regret the mentions
We are the wireless survivors of things gone
Slaves to the unnamed, never live long
Live and die by the line, never know fear
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?
Is it unfair? Cause I don't care
When I step on that ant on the grass
Progress the only thing that will last
3005, the year that we fear, only God will survive
To be alone is alive

[Hook: Childish Gambino & Azealia Banks]
See now I don’t wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
See now I don’t wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night

[Hook]
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what can I say?
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?

[Verse 1]
Can't sleep...
3 a.m., stare at the ceiling, murder the feeling
Spider crawl in the corner, brown recluse
So appropriate, cornucopia, so be it, say I'm over it
Playing Lil Durk, "Dis Ain't What U Want"
Look at my feet, I put my sneakers in the trunk
Pass a Fatburger through Atwater village
Laugh for a minute, couldn't cry for the life of me
Park by the bridge, sit on the hood
Look at the cars, stare at my hands, look at the moon
I can't find it, it's gone, what's wrong?
"Didn't respond when I texted you last night"
"You alright?"—yeah...

[Hook]
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what can I say?
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?

[Verse 2]
Man is a star bound to a body inside of me
20 million degrees, burn a man to his knees
Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry
And half of an apple pie, when I'm laughing, I'm satisfied
When I'm dying, I'm still alive, strange position
I'm in a good mood, so good I'mma kill that spider
In spite of the kinda things that they told me
Alone don't mean that you lonely
Alone means you finally get it, admit it
Go home, lock up the door, fold up the clothes
Watch cartoons for an hour, turn off the lights
Look at the recluse, look at the recluse
Look at the recluse, look at the rec—

[Outro]
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what can I say?
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?
Don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go

Uh-oh
Ohhh no no no no
(She said) no no no no
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more, oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Yeah, no no no

[Verse 1]
Face down in the brown grass
Shame shame on my brown ass
Birds in the trees as we run through
And if I'm dead to the world, what you gon' do?
What you gon' do? Like, "I can't remember"
Shots fired, rewind, please, girl, be mine
Email denied, talk to me baby
Before I go crazy, might do it maybe
We were so Jay Z and Beyonce, my aunt say "keep the sex game picante"
The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on
To make me try and forget that there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Hold my head in the weeds, man I can't tell her
The fear that I feel man it might kill her
Man, it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killa'
With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla
I don't care what he say
I'ma get my platinum back like I'm a half ton gorilla
You can hang with homie on the low
But your boy so weak like a week ago
But we ain't speaking though
We ain't speaking, we ain't speaking though

[Hook]
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you (she said, she said, she said)
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you (she said, she said, she said)
Love me better, kiss me back, Listen more oh (she said, she said, she said)
Love me better, kiss me back, listen -


[Bridge]
The attitude
The attitude
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
We were never friends
And I hope you understand now
But I miss them
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
Oh no no no
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand

(I hope you understand) I hope you understand
Cause everywhere I go
Everything I see
I just hope you understand

"Damn!"

[Verse 1]
(Blow up...)
Worldstar before rap, you already know that
So Fresh Prince they about to bring the show back
Listening to Kilo, weekend cost a kilo
Hair so long, I'm about to bring the fro back
Phone call gotta say "Moshi moshi" (Moshi moshi)
Girlfriend actin' all wishy-washy (wishy-washy)
It's your birthday, make it earthquake
Fell in love with a nigga like a mermaid (Daddy, I love him!)
That's a first date, nobody think about it, worst case
Best case, we the front page, 10K on the first day
Yeah, mothafucka, take your phone out
To record this, ain't nobody can ignore this
I'm more or less a moral-less individual
Making movies with criminals, tryin' to get them residuals
When it all go crazy, when I hear that action, I'ma be Scorsese
My nigga hold it horizontal man, be professional (Worldstar!)

[Interlude]
Worldstar, worldstar
Worldstar, worldstar

[Verse 2]
My girl ain't bad, she more like evil
When I'm lookin' in the mirror, how fly's this negro?
She on Hollywood and Vine
Thinkin' that she Hollywood on Vine
Makin' movies with her friends all the time
Showin' off her ass, that's a net twerk
But I saw through it like a wet shirt
Drive slow cause you might swerve off it
Still eat and the hate so salty
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee
And got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops 'til they stop, when I heard shots
Watching dude drop from a Glock at a—(shots fired)
Let me flash on 'em, we all big brother now
Lil' sis, let her run around
Money talking, you know the sound—brrrr
Money counter—brrrr, AK—brrrr
Cell phone—brrrr—Hello?

[Interlude: Steve G. Lover]
"Yo, bro man, check out that video I just sent you, man. This shit's hilarious, man. It's like this kid, man, he got like—he got like hit on the side of the head, man, he's like freakin' out
Like, it's like—"

We don't wanna be on (Worldstar!)
And all I wanna be is a (Worldstar!)
We don't wanna be on (Worldstar!)

When we were coming down, they said it was too soon
I never had to lie, no, no, no, no
When we were coming down, they left us all alone
We're headed nowhere, nowhere
I know you've been around
I feel you in and out, how are you?
Do you sleep? Are you with me?
We used to be unspoken, now everything is broken
I'm a good son
You're a good son
You're a good son, oh
You're a good son
Oh, you're a good son

[Beat Switch]

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
Free information, free information
Free information, free informa—

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Arlanda, hotel to the bar
Young girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the whole world
We can vibe out for tonight
Stepping outside for a light
No coke, and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know 'bout photos
Let's go though...
How old are you, saying that you never date older dudes?
That's why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
The coldest dude who can't hold his goose (woo!)
"I'ma walk out; wanna walk too?"
What about dude?
"Fuck him, I just really wanna feel something"

[Interlude: Kilo Kish]
"It took me like five minutes to figure out
What voices those were, on the phone
But I figured it out..."

[Interlude]
I'm a freaky bitch
I am five foot eight, 390
And I am a freaky bitch

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Heathen, it's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic, puff puff pass addict
Craftmatic, making moves but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie
Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest
Grind cause I'm stressed
TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous
Lost God, never prayed, forgotten us
Lost love, never say just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower
And anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait until I'm walking in it
With a gun that they 3D printed and finish it
Kinison said if you gonna miss heaven...
Why do it by two inches? Old money and new bitches

[Outro]
Getting next level in a hotel
Ain’t shit that we don’t need
Nigga oh well



[Intro]
I'm fly...

[Verse 1]
Man made the Web, you don't need a name
Man made of faults, I ain't too ashamed
Every thought I had, put it in a box (box)
Everybody see it just before the cops
Trolling, trolling, trolling these niggas
Rick Rolling these niggas, they mad cause they don't know any better
"Hold up, it's the kid—quick, tell him he can't sit with us!"
Fuck it, got money, bought friends like I'm TBS
VVS, I can see it all with the clarity
Real deep, hope they dig a nigga 'fore they bury me
Even though, we were told to go where they wouldn't go
Hella slow, that's that dial up, watch it pile up, fly

[Bridge]
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
(scratching)
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
(scratching)
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
(scratching)
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer

[Verse 2]
We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha—
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway
The manager pissed as hell
I mean where's the line between Donnie G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena
But needed some time to re-up
Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed
The Sauza so malo then she said "You need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That Camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song"
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder
You think you get it, you don't, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone—Now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden this burden, hurting
They said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and have a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying, "Go hard"
Making dope, it's a trap, Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out; "It's the best," no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the Internet, mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey, at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make 'em believe in themselves, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, keeling myself
No one's ever been this lost
I just get the information retweet it or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just a bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
(Who is this? Don't do it. Who is this?)
I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he moves with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make 'em dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference
These pieces of shit for breakfast
Funny, the day you're born, that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversating
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
Plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talk in the evening, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
Niggas take her props like a musical live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her:
"I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help"
She text me, "How you gon' trust somebody
When you don't trust yourself?"
I mean she right though, 45 like a light-bulb
And I could've died like my iPhone
But I kept going like a psycho
And I took chance like a dice roll
Dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass:
"You see what these labels do to me?"
Texts said, "I'm wet"; I said, "Hold up, wait up a minute"
H2O plus my D, that's my hood, I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gonna reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
Life's the biggest troll but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up

[Outro]
You're here now
You have to help me
You have to help me
I need you—you have to help me
You have to help me
You have to help me
Please help me
Please help me
Please, please help me
Please—

"Power 106!
LA, it's ya girl, Yesi Ortiz
Got some brand-new music
I need y'all to turn it up and let me know what you think
It's Lloyd, called "Oakland", on Power 106."

[Verse 1: Lloyd]
I was making Japanese
And she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5
And she waits till I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything, that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me "turn around," then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
And I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland

[Hook 1: Lloyd and Childish Gambino]
Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay
Babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, and oh

[Post-Hook: Childish Gambino and Lloyd]
I don't really mind the drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland, in Oakland

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Everything, that I needed
Now that I got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga don’t like that shit at all
So treated
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute

[Hook 2: Childish Gambino]
Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
But I'm really not ready, girl
That's a problem
Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know you choose to stay, and oh

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
All the girlfriends saying "here we go again"
Rich kid but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And they're saying it's because of the Internet
Try her once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes...right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try

[Outro: Lloyd]
Whoa
I took off my nine to five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me, just hit me
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone?
It's iffy, you miss me
I got furniture to move
And we'll both be thirty soon
In Oakland, in Oakland
The only one I know is you, so the fuck I'm supposed to do?
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland



[Produced by Childish Gambino & Ludwig Göransson]

I watch 'em all pass by the moon and stars
Let me hold him in my arms, forever more
These cold nights, the park is ours
Standing, by the side
Let you go, on, to the sea, just for me
Don't ever leave me, my love
Keep holding on, let the modest go
As my mind goes to and fro, waking up for one more show
We see him in the night, tell him I'm not afraid of him
I'm not afraid of 'em, cause I won't know



[Verse]
This is exactly what I wanted
All my fans love me, dad is proud of me
Momma cries for me
Cause she know there ain't sleep in my schedule
Having nightmares that I'm the black Heath Ledger
Sleep when I'm dead
These voices in my head
Got me waking up at 4 just so I can write instead
And my friends come and ask me if it's worth it
I tell them that "It better be, I did this shit on purpose!"
The worst is being worthless
Now a nigga priceless
Bloomingdale's coat, I don't have to check the prices
But I only go to feel a sense of control
Cause I get this shit for free if I wear promotional
And I'm not emotional when I do my work
I get emotional when I order that dessert
Cause she always ate dessert
And I deserted her
But I refuse to compromise career for a girl
Cause this music and this writing and this acting is my soul
And if I let it go, there'd be no one left to know
Being happy is the goal, but greatness is my vision
And all these girls are thinking they compete with my ambition
But, baby, I am different
This shit is my life
And if you don't believe me, you can never be wife
I'm walking in this darkness and I'm tryna find a light
And I'd rather die than be average and chances are I might, because

[Outro]
Things are changing, my life's gone pecans
Thirteen cities in the last eight weekends
All I know is baby I'm so tired
Record on Monday, tape on Tuesday
I ain't slowing down, I don't care what you say
Fuck this health thing, Momma I'm alright



[Hook]
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Okay, One for the money, two for the money
I used to write jokes, ain't this shit funny?
Models on me, yes these girls crazy
Gotta take advantage that is what the fans made me
Shine on these niggas, how these niggas stay shady?
And if you don't see me, you are not star gazing
Play my cards right, I may never meet the dealer
And yes I'm in the building like a horror movie killer
I gotta stay sick, I'd be dead if I was iller
Is it weird going hard when these niggas goin pillow?
Yep, my life is great, I changed my stars
I re-arrange fate when I rap on bars
Cheezy in the building, hope you niggas missed me
Chilling with these bitches, got my nigga feeling tipsy
Haters mean mugging, face is sour like my whiskey
I don't need a chaser, tell that liquor come and get me
Who'd have thought this rapping make sense, no 50?
And if you're doing great like I am, Say it with me

[Hook]
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I used to be broke, no cash
And them niggas played games, Road Rash
Walking 'round NYU, Looking for a dollar
Too proud to ask my friends or my struggling father
So I skate around the city for a couple hours
Dreaming up a day that I could say this world is ours
Now I got some, but I want it all
And I won't stop until Rihanna gives my ass a call
And I know that I'm addicted to this alcohol
Cause this shit hurts, call it the uncle curse
But I'm living for the moment, not the long haul
And I refuse to slow down until its last call
Erykah keeps telling me to grow a conscience
And treat women like money, no object
But these hoes are a much different story
Straight laced chicks don't do nothing for me
I'm in a weird place, I got a little money
But money won't buy you time, If all the time is running from me
There's so much I wanna do, like write a script or write a book
Get an hour on HBO, and date a girl who likes to cook
And stop having all of these crushes on all of my friends girlfriends
I think I'm jealous they got someone when the world ends
It looks nice, I gotta get me one of those
I haven't found Mrs. Right, but I'm On it though
Yeah I'm on it though

[Hook]

[Intro]
It's royalty
It's royalty

[Verse 1: Ghostface]
Hey world, this is lollipop
Raps for the sweet tooth
The real fiends who want that GhostFace and Sheek Louch
Big chain changlin' charms, they be danglin'
Eighty thou worth of the ice, I'll strangle 'em
My raw fish scale, paid the jeweler named Ishmael
Had to eagle fly back to my wrist
Bigger chips, bigger wings, bigger rings
I'm with the Childish Gambino
On that Eastwood shit, pushin' a Gran Turino
Tarantino don't got reservoir dogs like mine
Thirty six different niggas with the same state of mind
Dirty Ghetto Kids lovin' them haters
We got skaters that'll ox your whole face off
Rob you like Madoff
Drug kingpins on the diet, we get that weight off
Real hood niggas snatch a bitch and clean your plate off
Gambino rap, cash money crack, table casino
Precision cut emeralds, sapphire visuals



[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP
Bino so insensitive, she asking, "Why you say that?!"
I'm chilling, real nigga feeling
Rich kid, asshole: paint me as a villain
Still spitting that cash flow: DJ Khaled
I got a penthouse on both coasts: pH balance
Real nigga, I rep those, why though? Cause I said so
Hip deep in the Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo
You faker than some Sweet'N Low
Yeah, you got some silverware
But really are you eating though?
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch and dinner's for beginners
You ain't even know
Never catching cases, why they faces look so E-M-O?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano
My architect know Japanese, yo' girl, she jocking these
No hands like soccer teams and y'all fuck boys like Socrates
You niggas ain't copping these, niggas ain't looking like me
Nah, I ain't checking I.D. but I bounce 'em with no problem
Tell 'em, Problem (Problem!)

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)
Rich kid, asshole, paint me as a villain

[Hook: Problem]
Whaaat?
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' do?

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Different color, my passport, Instagram my stack load
Hashtag my day wear and your girl drink my day care
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair (silver spoon coon, ho)
Ain't nobody sicker and my Fisker, "vroom, vroom," ho
Ain't nobody—
Fiskers don't make noise when they start up...
Just so you know
Top of the Hold 'em totem, rich forever
A million was not the quota
My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, tripping off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods
And I'm too fly: Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that a-k-a
White hood, white hood, (okay-kay-kay)
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
So Maserati, you whipping a Kia
Spending this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Waking up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dope man, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
"Err-eh-err-eh": onomatopoeia
Oh, I got my cool on! (Tailormade!)
I'm winning so they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't give a fuck about my family name

[Hook: Problem]
Whaaat?
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' do?



[Hook]
If we were kids
I'd want to give you everything that you would want
Those other boys
They give you toys, but all they wanna do is
Keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up

[Verse 1]
I guess I'm fucking now
I'm getting used to it
It's cause I shine, and I ain't gotta use a crucifix
Fuck the fussing and fighting and arguing to this and that
And "Why you bein' mean to me Donald?" I never text her back
I know it's comin' quick, wishin' I could fast forward
Tell these "nice girls" they're the reason that I'm an asshole
Omega to alpha male because of that dollar bill
When I worked the mail room I ain't have a shot in hell
I called her ass for two months and heard shit from her
These girls couldn't care less when the chips under
The chips are up and on my shoulder, you heard me?
I take it out on girls who don't even deserve it
The girls I tried to hit last year, I still might
Karma's a bitch who doesn't suck, but I still like
If we were kids I had the black K-swiss and reebok
If we were kids I wouldn’t act like this but we not

[Hook]
If we were kids
I'd want to give you everything that you would want
Those other boys
They give you toys, but all they wanna do is
Keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up

[Verse 2]
You made a mistake
These dudes man you bathing in apes
Finding you is like finding Asians I hate
But they say I got a fetish, nah I’m skipping all of it
Black or white girls always come with a set of politics
That’s all I was saying
I’m a proud man
They wanna holla when they see your name on SoundScan
Her name Mercedes but she push a brown Focus
And she’s doing coke in front of me, but act like I don’t notice
"There any breakage in that Trojan?"
She see what she wanna see
So I make her take Plan B in front of me
Women talk shit on men like all day
But it's Pete Wentz, goes both ways
They too busy stabbing hoes like OJ
They too busy trapping pros like Kobe
The only thing I put before me is do re
If you had told me the truth we’d be ok

[Hook]
If we were kids
I'd want to give you everything that you would want
Those other boys
They give you toys, but all they wanna do is
Keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
It’s alright
It’s okay
It’s alright
It’s okay girl
It’s okay



[Verse 1: Jaden Smith]
One time I was at the beach
And we were looking at the stars
And this girl was laying next to me
And the blanket that we had was,  had stars on it as well
So it looked liked we were just floating in an abyss
Honestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess
I mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them so we could see what the waves look like
I'll be waiting here on the sand
I remember that first night
You were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt
So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother
Not as pure, so insecure
The times have changed
But really we just looked up at the stars
For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars
The world was ours it was yours—it was mine
The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of
Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me
On this beautiful night
Maybe we can make things right
Maybe we can do it without any spite
It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end
So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him
If we met bet it would be awkward break out the Sudafed
Cause the flow cold, like a SoCo
I was smoking smoking John Lennon where my Yoko?
This that call yo grandma you ain't ready yet
Verbal mania, imma show you the illest, get my cousin to kill it
Had a flow but you steal it, I'm in the mood so we ball out
Got the top down in the back we could fall out
We could fall out, nigga we could fall out
Your girlfriend push a Prius, she giving me that genius
Mensa, we that Tony Danza
Wine on the rug man you know that shit expensive
I'm on that Willy Wonka, green so Blanka
Vape so good and the pot like lobster
Nigga imma monster, fuck it I'm a monstar
Man, I got this beat I'm going ham like a cop car
That's unless you see me pulling up on the boulevard
Turn them flashing lights, at least you know who you really are
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
I guess this ending's the best for me
But I can't leave you behind
You know that I never wanted to see what's on your mind

[Outro: Fam]
Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn
Yo it's kinda hard not to like, get fucking cheesy on this shit
But, does that even matter?
You know what I'm saying, juxtaposition man
Juxta-fucking-position
My nigga Jaden Smith dropping  jewels and niggas don't believe him cause he's Jaden Smith
But it's all about packaging right?
Real shit though, good and bad is all relative man
It really is, a lot of niggas is sheep
We don't even know what we like anymore
We just know what the most hype is
Shit, do you really like that shit you like?
Or you like the way they gave it to you?
You know what I'm saying?
Pepsi, Coca-Cola same thing
Dave Chapelle said that, the one that taste the best
Was the one that was paying him the most at the time
That's all that happens with us man
We some weak niggas man, all of us
Followers, sheeps, plural made that shit up
Apologin' ain't no real word my nigga
We know this, but he knows more cause he broke the rules that don't even fucking exist man
Funny thing is man is like, as a futurist
And I can call myself a futurist
Nobody is even going to give a fuck until I'm gone
So does it even matter?
Yes it does...



[Hook]
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl and uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us

[Verse 1]
A New York nine's an everywhere else six
Timewise, the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on West End
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuck and hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at Pianos
They cross-fadin' off of Nanos
Ugh, on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster, bitch
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin' out in BK
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ
Like, she listenin' to old Freeway
Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different
Right, that’s why your friends need wristbands?
Fuck you
Can I have this dance?

[Hook]
Baby, you're the baddest

[Verse 2]
We could pretend if you want to, like
We in love and started datin' at your art school
Cause either way we both lyin' more than half of the time
Except for when I’m home workin' on your graphic design
Every time we see each other I'm takin' you home
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stallone
Yellow-911-Persian-girl-in-the-back car
But me writin' a verse would be the only way they buyin' a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic bitch, I love Rugrats
Watchin' lames handle they fame
They bang any broad with bangs
In a band with an animal name
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson
Anallin' anyone is the plan for the evening
I'm kidding, stop
Girl cryin' on Ludlow
She still look good though
Love is Eastside, who are you to hate?
Movie ass, not a 10 but a Super 8
You ain't see me at the show, I was super great
Hotel penthouse, go on and let it ruminate
City never sleeps, so I guess I'm never slept on
Did everything I could, then I kept goin'

Ooh girl, I wanna know
Are you ready to cry? Cause I'm no good, no good
Ooh girl, I wanna try
I'm an awful guy and I'm always away
And I'm tryin' to say
I'm a piece of shit
Believe in this

Cause we barely knew, what we had
I'm not that bad, the fun we had
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the culdesac, this is where the street ends
I am just a rapper, I ain't got the time for speakin'
Nigga stay weak like tornado and a tree branch
I never have a weak day, my life's a long weekend
Fuckin' with ya raw, bitch. My mouth should get tested
Sleepin' on a nigga, hope you feel well rested
Gambino stay on, can't nobody pull the cord out
A nigga fucked up, like a hang gliding whore house
Sick boy, yeah, the clique on deck
Yes, I rap absurd. Got the game upset
And they rap about the jewelry, the weed they smoke
And I rap about my life, and niggas think it's a joke, nah
I only put real on a nigga
Bitches see the money, try and steal on a nigga
Yes, I'm on fire, you can feel it on a nigga
Step away from the heat; they Shaquillin' on a nigga
Treat niggas like pussy, go hard on 'em
Watch the swagga get swiped like a card, bottom
The swag's unique, I don't even worry 'bout 'em
I got the tortoise shell frames and the argyle
You wouldn't think from the things I'm fashionin'
I'd get more bush than Kim Kardashian
Drop hot shit. Yeah, my mouth's a laxative
Born to be the greatest, this is not by accident

[Hook]
Hey player, what's good?
(Let me dope you!)
Hey hater, what's hood?
(Let me dope you!)
I'm on fire like wood
(Let me dope you!)
And you don't wanna fuck with dude
(Let me dope you!)

[Bridge]
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit

[Verse 2]
I'm a genius, I ain't gotta fake shit
My cup runeth over, you can take sips
I'm in a spa, white robe like a racist
Niggas can't see me, I will pay for your LASIK
Buck what ya heard, bitch. I'm flyer than you ever seen
My wallet make paper, call it Evergreen
Ashy to classy, finally got some Vaseline
Live inside a sauna cause I always got my self-esteem
Name in your mouth, and it seems as though I struck a nerve
I never fit in like my penis in these tiny girls
I figured I was different from these other guys
When I wrote for 30 Rock, I was under 25
These other rappers wanna fade into the background
Ima stand out when these niggas done sat down
I always pack heat. Yeah, my mouth need a pat down
Money, girls, clothes. I don't worry about that now

[Hook]

[Bridge]



[Verse]
You're the only girl that I have ever wanted
Every other girl is trying to be you
My mama says that I should write you letters
But I think you're with other dudes
Take my hand, you'll like it
You don't even have to call
Yes I've had some alcohol, I'm sorry
Take my hand
You don't even have to call
You're somewhere out there after all

[Outro]
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wanted



[Intro: Kilo Kish]
Umm, okay
Yea, candy
Uhh, where is this song in my Blackberry?
Yea, yea
Alright cool

[Verse 1: Kilo Kish]
Okay
As my mind run licking cotton candy lipstick
You're right here in my room, yeah I wished it
Candlelight vigil for the one you're texting
Pink sweatpants - hmm, interesting
No need, don't explain to me, love
Cause I know how you deal, but I could see us
In a different way, don't play me cause we're not the same
Sign on, sees your screename and misbehave
So you're a playboy, you think you're Heff kid?
Hoppin' round town with the bunnies when
I'm the candy that you need, brush your sweet tooth
Heard you got me replaced with a statue?
A veneer, I hear, she's just swell
If you want to date a rock, you think I can't tell?
So you bored? Are you lost? Was it worthwhile?
I feel the ice-cold chill in her warm smile
Saw you last night, you didn't have to act foul
Come and sweep me from the back room
Feel my palms heat up on your chest now
As the night creeps into bedtime vows
Married in a white t-shirt, Bed-Stuy
Still you know that I'm the best ride
You deserve what you get: it's called respect
You ever heard of it?

[Hook: Kilo Kish]
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
Make it go right
Make it go right
I know what you're missing in the moonight
I can fly away and make it go right
It go
It go

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
I used to front somethin' stupid, now I'm makin' them wait
Except for you mama, I'm ready, I don't wanna be late
Never hesitate, you know it, petty cash, we blow it
Excuse me for imperfect, them halfway looks is worth it
I watched these niggas lurkin', they just want my leftovers
Watched 'em locked up all day and slept over
Put your hair back: Afro
Skippin' after-parties at the last show
I'mma hold your hand in little Tokyo
And tell you somethin' in your ear that you shouldn't know
Two jumps, but the feeling was so gone
High school swag, busy fuckin' with clothes on
Lost a couple words, joke around the reason
You can wear my shirt, pretend to let you win that FIFA
There was nothing like it...settle down
You always hit me when my boo around
It's a long walk - we ain't talkin', though
That ratchet ho on lock-n-load, I appreciate the offer, though
I'mma do it right - later, though
Cuz either way you're gonna hate me like you say you won't
Thank God for that - it's called regret
You ever heard of it?

[Hook: Kilo Kish]
I know what you're missing in your new life

You know that I love you
So let me into you

[Hook 2]
Let me into your heart
Do you really love me?

Oh, oh God

[Bridge]

Stone Mountain
Childish
Dram (Gangsta grizzle!)

[Pre-Hook: Childish Gambino]
I like smokin' loud, I like being me

[Hook]
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby

[Verse 1]
Fly girl, she named Beatle
Clothes off, she don't need 'em
Animals, she don't eat 'em
Hungry for it, I feed her, uh, I feed her
You already know that I feed her
I don't mess with them fuck boys, she said I don't either
She said I'm gone eat her, attitude so diva
Got a big place like Scarface, treat her ass like Elvira
Skin tone godiva, smokin' on that cheeba
Girl you got me so hypnotized that thang be givin' me fever
Let me get it
Take her to Kauai, fucked on the beach
Fucked on the floor, we ain't gotta speak
Beach, getting high like a motherfuck
Royalty the team so you know what's up
Kitty so good, let me beat it up, kitty so good I could sleep in it
Hollow tip flow sending shots to my enemies
Niggas who tried to Nick Cannon me
Thoughts were so bad that I pleaded insanity
Bottles, I pop me a case
Live on the radio bought me a place
This is my summer of love
Yea, all these bitches is down
But never put nothin' above

[Hook]
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby

[Verse 2]
Kick it like Kazuya
This game is how we maneuver
There's plenty fish in the sea and I treat them groupies like grouper
My life inside a computer, back up my soul to the cloud
Funny we show 'em class and they call me the class clown
Money is in my jeans, best believe that it's passed down
Got the room thumpin, she tell me don't stop
I mean really don't stop
I must be doing something
Something really on point, something really on point
Now she look back at it
But she give me that look when I gotta dip out
Stop being Dramatic (DRAMATIC!)
Can't nobody do it like this
Forgot her name as soon as I hit
Got that buzz, the phone was silent
Run the game, that's us
Fort Knox, gold bars
Let her get it on both sides, I did it all, with no cosign
And I'm ballin' like I give a fuck
Now they know wassup
Smokin' like she wanna fuck
We are not in love, she's a grown up
And I'm so childish
Still that's my bitch
We waste our time with all this

[Hook]
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby
Money baby, money baby, money baby



[Part 1: Move That Dope]

[Verse 1]
Whippin' the Lam', whippin' and grippin' the Lam'
Niggas like 'Bino the man, I was  like damn
I was allergic to not makin' money, the timing was perfect
They used to not pay him no never mind
Niggas these numbers don't ever lie
Fuck wit' your boy like a pedophile
Damn I'm fly, I'm so high I might need a spaceship
I'm on acid, this bitch is basic
We them niggas y'all love to hate on
But when you see us y'all never say shit
Conversation, I'm in that, top 5, I'm in rap
Pussy niggas, y'all say shit and don't do shit
Flew your girl to Saint Lucia
Oh, these niggas are not from Atlanta, these niggas are not from Atlanta
Cause I'm from Atlanta and we would just handle it
Struggle rap, Canibus
Amethyst, my weed purple
Rap game, I'm Steve Urkel, Urquelle
She want some pics, I'm like "oh well, you better Google search"
Money rule my universe
Nigga we made it
We had the beat and then we heard the verse and said "nigga we hate it"
Livin' my life like I'm Jaden (Smith)
Tesla the color of Satan (whip)
Bitches are mine for the takin'
I understand why you hate us

[Part 2: Nextel Chirp]

[Hook]
Nigga don't (DRAMATIC!)
Hit me on my Nextel chirp, when you heard that *brrrp* *brrrp*, mean that nigga got some work
Yeah, my cousin used to serve 'em, now he learning how to walk
If you really from Atlanta then you heard this shit before
Yeah, you know, uh
Nigga don't hit me on my Nextel chirp
When you heard that *brrrp* *brrrp*, mean that nigga got some work
Yeah, my cousin used to serve 'em, now he learning how to walk
If you really from Atlanta then you heard this shit before
Yeah, you know, uh

[Verse 2]
Yes I be the man, who you tellin'?
Smokin' on that loud, what you smellin'?
Cops want a nigga for the sport
Hundred dollars, can't afford it
Made my momma cry in court
Fuck them niggas
Fulton County, Cobb County, see the twelve be out
See you wit' your friends and break you up cause you hanging out
Learn to talk about, what you talkin' 'bout?
Never on the phone, had to do it on my own
Took a minute, now we on, yeah
Scooter got the Street Lottery, that's a classic
Cause it be showin' niggas how to be when you passin'
That white girl, that white girl, Niykee Heaton, yeah
I might girl, I might girl, are you eatin' though?
Patience, congratulations, I'm on my A shit
I met this dude while on vacation, I didn't say shit
When he was talkin' all that bullshit about the nation
His daughter, I just gave a facial, my reparations

[Bridge]
Uh, it's a new black renaissance
Uh, all that wack shit they be on
Uh, what's the type of shit that they be on
Uh, what's the type of shit that they be on

[Part 3: Let Your Hair Blow]

[Scratches and Rewinds]

[Intro: Young Scooter]
Let the top down and let your hair blow (x6)
You got a perfect body, all natural
Body that the superstar lookin' for
Hey baby, let's just go for a ride, okay

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
You got a perfect body, all natural
Body that the superstar lookin' for
Let's ride and let the top down
Let your hair blow, ride and smoke out
We party on the Interstate, shut I-20 down
Even in the winter flexin' with the top down

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Top down, let 'em see a king
East side, East side, I'm just bein' me
I'm just seein' Gs, I'm just makin' culture
I just say the realest shit and hope it don't insult you
On stage, yellin' crazy shit
I was high but I meant that shit
Let it out, gotta vent that shit
Play me loud, that's event music
I don't swear to God, I just swear to me
I don't think there's anything I couldn't be
All we know is trust, that's the R O Y A L T Y
Please don't ask a king what it's hard to be

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Let the top down and let your hair blow
Let the top down and let your hair blow
You got a perfect body, all natural
Body that the superstar lookin' for
Let's ride and let the top down
Let your hair blow, ride and smoke out
We party on the Interstate, shut I-20 down
Even in the winter flexin' with the top down



[Intro: DJ Drama]
As time goes on (Hello?, hello?)
Your talk keeps getting smaller (Hello?, hello?)
As Childish lives in his short shorts,
He's got no time for your short money!

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Two gold chains and I still don't never wear 'em
Why would I wear 'em? Cheese like a camera
Spendin' money son a bitch nigga like Sanford
I'm lookin' in the mirror, I'm like 'Damn, I'm so handsome'
If it ain't 'bout that money, why a young god answer?
Ghost on my wrist (wrist), got me so Casper
Flow so cold, watch them haters get asthma
And every time we fuckin', man she think that's the last one

[Hook: Kari Faux (8x)]
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk

[Verse 2: Kari Faux]
Three cellphones and I still don't ever call 'em
Why would I call 'em?  Bitch you know I'm ballin'
Spendin' money, make it bounce back like Spalding (Swish)
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans
And he ain't talkin' money nigga, why the fuck you talkin'
All my bitches bossy, all my diamonds flossy
Rap game sriracha man you know I'm saucy
I got a white dude in Boston, he whip an Audi

[Hook: Kari Faux (4x)]
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Young Bino, we be mobbin'
You don't see me, I'm on an island
These haters left us no choice
Leave the trap like so moist
Little rock like dope boys
Oh my God, I'm out of fucks
Colombian but she ain't a plug
That's racist
In '96 I had K-swiss
You 96 with some fake bitch
And I 69'd with a bunch of dimes and that money talk my language
Head game so Cambridge
God damn, you dirty...
You were lettin' me bust in it
But if they ask I plead the fifth

[Bridge: Kari Faux]
Ok this the part where I need ya'll to make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans

[Hook: Kari Faux]



[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Yea, we party ‘til the sun up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up

[Verse 1: Steve G Lover]
Fuck the recession, I’ma keep this thing going
If you ain’t know 'em, bet you probably still work for ‘em
Chick from Bermuda, that’s right I get my work foreign
They don’t get paid, I got hard dick and purp for 'em
Niggas out of line, get a shovel in the dirt for ‘em
Niggas wanna move, get the trucks and the shirt for ‘em
OG status, my job’s got perks for ‘em
Money, clothes, hoes, you ain’t ever gotta search for ‘em
You know what I’m doing, nigga I’ma do things
Getting to the money, I guess I got a few things
Fifteen nines, five dimes, only two chains
Smoke like Jamaicans, run it like I’m Usain
Fresh from the haircut down to the shoestrings
Hoes talk about me, I’ma need a new name
Steve G the prince, I’m looking like the new king
All I do is win so who the hell’s losing

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Yea, we party ‘til the sun up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up
Yea, we party ‘til the sun up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Bino what the dealy, I heard that flow was silly
I heard you was so east side and that pussy's your Achilles
But really it’s time to get up, smoking on that get up
Bino lay it down and work it out like a sit up
I’m feeling like a winner, my living be so easy
My old girl look Leona, my new girl look Yukimi
So illy, I got espressos, mi mami give me besos
Shades on my face, Armani helping me lay low
D-Money get his name, these other niggas lame
These niggas used to hate me, I guess ain’t nothing changed
Shotgun in the Porsche, she don’t know where we going
American Royalty on that yolo Ralph Lauren
It’s that city where Luda be, stunting was new to me
But now we killing paper, fuck it I might just shoot a G
Leave your face open like you Breezy, I mean it
Nobody need to see nobody leaking, believe me

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Yea, we party ‘til the sun up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up
Yea, we party ‘til the sun up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up



[Verse 1]
I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all
I'm hopin' that it's cause I'm livin' everything I want
I used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt
Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut
My dad works nights, putting on a stone face
He's saving up so we can get our own place
In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me
They called me fat nose, my mom say you handsome to me
Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced
But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants
And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out
They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in NY deal crack
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood
They think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same
Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit
But all they get now is, "Can your son read this script?"

[Hook]
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Dad lost his job, mama worked at Mrs. Winner's
Gun pulled in her face, she still made dinner
“Donald watch the meter so they don’t turn the lights off"
Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school
And I hate it there
They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair
And my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book
He’s supposed to pay ‘em back
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero
So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads
Under the pillow, like that would do somethin'
But she’s got six kids, she’s gotta do somethin'
She don’t want me in a lifestyle like my cousin
And he mad cause his father ain’t around
He lookin’ at me now, like
"Why you so fuckin lucky? I had a father too
But he ain’t around so I'mma take it out on you"
We used to say "I love you," now we only think that shit
It feels weird that you’re the person I took sink baths with
Street took you over, I want my cousin back
The world sayin' what you are
Because you’re young and black, don’t believe ‘em
You’re still that kid who kept the older boys
From teasin', for some reason

[Hook]
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows

[Outro]
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Oh, help us Lord
Oh, baby baby baby



[Piano plays, distinct partying sounds]



[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I just wanna roll with a cutie one
I ain't tryna catch no feels
We can get along sometimes
We ain't gotta be sincere
You ain't gotta laugh so small
Breathing all down my back
They ain't never had what we had
They ain't never felt like that
Cause them summer days
Never fade away
They just stay the same
In my mind, my mind
And them summer days
Never fade away
They just stay the same
In my mind, no no

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
It's those summer days
Never fade away
It just stays the same
In my mind, no no
It's those summer days
Never fade away
Never, never change
In my mind, no no

[Verse 2: Stevie G. Lover III]
Ok, Royalty is red hot
Shots from a redbone
Talking bout her skin tone her color beats headphones
Baby I'm just living right, and you can say I'm dead wrong
But can you disagree with that , versace on me
Got gold on the V-neck I'm passing every G  check
Didn't fuck her for a month and never had a regret
It was just nice to have you chilling up in Key West
And we was just chill, I didn't really need sex
But really is we fucking yo
Never serious so I make everything a fucking joke
She be pushing buttons and she push it till that button broke
Then we smoke a blunt and all the drama it go up in smoke
See she just graduated got a new job
Took that nose ring out her nose and went and bought a new Saab
Got that boyfriend that she living with and she don't smoke no more
But yo it's cool I liked her when I knew her back before like

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
It's those summer days
Never fade away
It just stays the same
In my mind, no no
It's those summer days
Never fade away
Never, never change
In my mind, no no

[Verse 1 - Childish Gambino]
Now that we have found this love, baby
I can't explain my feel, oh
Now that we have found this love, baby

Loving you is all I know, baby
You make me feel so high, oh no
I just wanna feel your love, baby
You know I'm down to ride, oh no no

Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good

[Verse 2 - Childish Gambino]
Now that we have found this love, baby
These haters can't say shit, oh

I know you miss this di-love
Let's go somewhere far away, baby
Where we don't need no phone, oh
Cause now that we have found this love, baby
You'll never be alone, oh oh

[Pre-Chorus - Childish Gambino]
When your song is on and your hand's in mine

All my friends are telling me, oh

[Outro w/ Jaden Smith]
I used to walk on the beach at night
I remember
The best time was when well, me and you
We got all our friends and we got a tent
We slept in it
Not the whole night, but just enough time
Magic happened, nothing was born luckily
It's up to me, but
Then we left
The times have changed
The pleasures that I feel
They say you never say never, it's real
Electric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep
I like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep
I'd like to write a poem for you, leave it for you in your room Under the moon, romance
Hold on, brother



[Chorus]
Ok, light-skinned girls, you can put it in my video
Dark-skinned girls, you can put in my video
Thick girls, you can put it in my video
Thin girls, you can put in my video
Smarty art chicks, you can put it my video
Dumb hoes, you can put it in my video
Smooth girls, you can put it in my video
Nerd girls, you can put it in my video

[Verse 1]
I'm blowing up like my swagger on the Gaza
I'm writing movies where I'm making out with Aubrey Plaza
And homegirl my homegirl, it is not like that
But if she tried to rape me, I would not fight back
Girls who turned me down are saying "please" and "sorry"
You lucky that I'm Randy, Aziz Ansari
So now I'm in the club tellin' strippers they should back it up
I wanna hang with Lil Wayne, I just hope that I'm black enough
Damn, I guess we're all friends here
Except for I don't know you, like you was me last year
It's funny how these niggas all treat me like we best friends
I wanna fuck these small girls, minus "S-M"
Meaning that I fuck all girls, that is wordplay
Catch me on my iPhone doing what the birds say
I ain't going nowhere, somebody better tell a hater
He's goin' down like my living room elevator
Fuck what you heard, bitch, I'll fuck your fuckin' brains out
And make you wash your boyfriend's sheets to get the stains out
Put your fucking boots on, it's time to kick the lames out
You got your favorite rapper in your ear, it's time to change out

[Chorus]
Light-skinned girls, you can put it in my video
Dark-skinned girls, you can put in my video
Thick girls, you can put it in my video
Thin girls, you can put in my video
Smarty art chicks, you can put it my video
Dumb hoes, you can put it in my video
Smooth girls, you can put it in my video
Nerd girls, you can put it in my video

[Verse 2]
Watch your girlfriend, I'll fuck her then I up and leave her
Girls chase me like they think my dick is Justin Bieber
Pussy thrown at me, you fuckin' with a wide receiver
I'm a genius, and I ain't try to hide it either
Got a lot of hay, let me pay for what you sip tonight
Mixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fucking kryptonite
Baby girl, shorty, have it however you want it
Whatever you asking 'bout, I promise you that I done it
My swagger's New York but my home is the South
And it's amazing how I eat more pussy than Alf
And I'm all up in your ear but then I'm all in your mouth
I don't talk, but girls the only thing we're talkin' about

[Chorus]
Light-skinned girls, you can put it in my video
Dark-skinned girls, you can put in my video
Thick girls, you can put it in my video
Thin girls, you can put in my video
Smarty art chicks, you can put it my video
Dumb hoes, you can put it in my video
Smooth girls, you can put it in my video
Nerd girls, you can put it in my video

[Outro]
Put, put it in my video
Put, put, put, put it in my video



[Hook: Childish Gambino]

Nigga I’m from Georgia that’s the realest state

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I’m feeling like New Zealand, charge it to the Am-Ex
Gotta use that latex or she living like a princess
They don’t wake you up in private, let a nigga sleep
I got houses in the mountains, man Will Smith live down the street
Got that generation money my grandkids are assholes
Stacking something dummy every verse I got got cash flow
Monaco they loved me, I’m wearing something ugly
But they still know I’m rich though so my doo-rag lookin’ stuffy
Rollin’ with the royalty Kauai is just my Camelot
Glasshouse, champagne, white shirt, no socks, no top Saint Bart's
Pushin’ 997’s like I’m making fuckin’ phone calls
Half a mill is low ball
Lot of diamonds light bright, whiskey older than Betty White
Spot me on Dalmatian Croatian girls salvation us
Make something of myself man
Somebody let’em know, ‘cuz it’s that eastside nigga (A-T-L!)

[Hook: Childish Gambino]

[Verse 2: Alley Boy]
Ridin’ around with a whole meal, real estate can a nigga live?
Gold slug no ice grill, deal with molly, no x pill
Georgia nigga I’m A-town, eastside nation wide
Rep nigga like Tim Briggs, killed them, homicide
Real estate that’s my estate Georgia peach like Big Meech
Mason Ave, that’s my street, we sellin’ crack on Front Street
Old money got dust on it, old chopper got rust on it
New crib got a ticket on it, just cashed out seven figures on it
Baby momma, stank bitch fought child support, I’m too rich
Pussy ho got lucky, you can pay your bills on my dick
My driver license’s suspended, but I’m still ridin’ in a Bentley
I’m still strapped with that semi, real estate we winnin’
Me and Childish Gambino plenty chips no casino
Poppin’ bottles with models they gone suck on some pronto
Put my grill in your real estate, know I come from that realest state
Niggas eating off our paper plate, we just copped them new Audi 8's

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
I got a PJ for the whole crew

Get used to it, Royalty nigga, Royalty motherfucker
Motherfucking eastside stand up, Stone Mountain, L-town
We in this bitch like we fucking a dog or some shit my nigga
Man y’all motherfuckers already know what it is
Royalty forever in this bitch, bitch niggas fall back
Real recognize real and y’all sucka niggas ain’t it
You feel me? Man don’t watch me, watch TV
Wait, ‘Bino on that shit too, God damn
Man we gettin' that white people money, you heard that?
Matter of fact Tina, tell these niggas what I’m talking about one time

[Outro 2: Tina Fey]
Yeah we in here, we in this thing
Gambino is forever, Royalty is forever
We ballin’ ‘till we fuckin’ up the hardwood homey
This is the life we live, son
My president is black and my Prius is blue motherfucker
Royalty all day, we droppin’ racks in Nordstroms son
That’s racks on racks damn it
You feel me? You feel me?
This is the part where most people would say something crazy and drop the n-word after it
Not going to, not gonna do that
I don’t feel comfortable
I’m out!



[Verse 1]
Daylight
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, yeah
You can have it, oh, oh, oh
If you need it, ooh
We can make it, oh
If you want it
You can have it

[Chorus]
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin' (ooh)
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

[Verse 2]
Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, oh
You can have it, you can have it
If you need it
You better believe in something
We can make it
If you want it
You can have it, ah!

[Chorus]
But stay woke (stay woke!)
Niggas creepin' (they be creepin')
They gon' find you (they gon' find you)
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Gon' catch you sleepin', put your hands up now baby)
Ooh, now stay woke

(Oh, oh, baby you, how'd it get...)
How'd it get so scandalous?
How'd it get so scandalous?
But stay woke
But stay woke



[Verse 1]
Se que has salido sin mi y
Que no me has querido decir y
Que te han visto por ahi
Con otra persona que te hace mentir

Se que no vas a volver y
Que hoy te vas a brillar con quien
Me dijiste una vez
Que no me preocupara que vieras otra vez

Ay, me hiciste esperarte tanto
Y hoy se que el siempre te tuvo a lado
Ay, me hiciste amarte tanto
La intuicion me dice que fuiste un rato

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, yeah
You can have it, oh, oh, oh
If you need it, oooh
We can make it, oh
If you want it
You can have it

[Chorus]
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Oooh)
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

[Verse 2]
Y ahora quieres volver y crees
Que yo voy a caer
No es necesario explicar
Todas las razones por las que no voy a hacerlo

No se porque regresaste
Es hasta tonto creer
Que voy a dejarte volver
Toma tus maletas que no te quiero ver

[Chorus]
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Oooh)
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, oh

[Chorus]
But stay woke

[Intro]
Uh uh
Yeah we gon' get it
Yeah
Uh uh
Oh no no no

[Hook]
We can go together
It doesn't really matter
We can get there
We can do it if we try
You know that I love you
Put no one else above you
We can get there
We can do it if we try

[Verse 1]
Young Bino in the house like an B&E
Why I'm looking so fly, I'm just being me
Moved up, weed
In my girl clutch
White girls so
The twelve never really searched
Smoke cars, swear to god
She need a bigger purse
Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work
Lay it out on the island
She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in
The OG making noise like a firetruck
Flew in, touched down
Then we light 'em up
I've been saying that the clique
There's a lot of us
They talk shit
But nobody else on top of us
Got popular
This the real shit
Get ... in the face
With a full clip
Get ... in the aim
Niggas don't slip
Then get ...
With a case just for sellin' it
I know them gorillas
I hang with them killers
They paint 'em as villains
When really they livin'
We gotta ball
This is world war three
I'm the new Jay-Z
I ain't write shit down
I'mma steal that crown
I'mma do that thing
Girl you sweeter than mango
How we cool and confident
With hair like Django
How we walk in the room
And the girls they notice
'Cus they know you bogus
I'm the man you noticed
And...

[Hook]
We can go together
It doesn't really matter
We can get there
We can do it if we try
You know that I love you
Put no one else above you
We can get there
We can do it if we try

[Verse 2]
I'mma show you how to do this
It's easy when you
Let go, let go
Didn't mean to make you nervous
The booty lookin' retro retro
You can be the moon to me
And I can be your spotlight (spotlight)
And if you think I'm ballin'
You shoulda seen me last night, last night
Fuck that, fuck ya'll and the po-po's
Down under, surfin' on the Gold Coast
I'm looking for the truth in a blunt
And I ain't got a home
Let's stunt
So baby if you feel like you wanna leave
I ain't afraid to drop a couple skymiles
The game ain't easy
We both deserve a little bit of timeout

[Outro]
We can go together
It doesn't really matter
*Cough*
Oh
Yeah
'Kay, one, two, three, go!
Oh, hey
Oh, hey, ah
One more time



[Intro]
Uh, ahhh!
Ayy

[Verse 1]
I can feel it deep inside my body
I've been watching all this all night
I got to move it
This pressure brewing
This world don't feel alright

[Chorus]
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, son, ahhh!

[Verse 2]
No good's happening
World, we're out of captains
Everyone just wants a better life
They tried to kill us
Love to say they feel us
But they won't take my pride

[Chorus]
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Everyone, everyone!
Get down, baby, get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, son

[Outro]
Everyone
Get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, high
Everyone
Get down, baby
Fly, fly, fly, son

This... is Blake Griffin. This... is royalty

[Kristen Schaal speaking]
(It's royalty! It's Royalty...)



[Hook]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up

[Verse 1]
Young God what it is, how you livin', huh
Young thing and she sayin' let me beat it up
See me out in my ride, wanna key it up
He got a Kia, I got a Bimmer
She got a Fiat, half Italian
She wanna ride up, on my stallion
See me stylin', I'ma ride out
Hit Lihue then we drive to the hide out, uh
That's the way that we living
He fly her out every weekend
Because her thinking is different
She dance around in the kitchen
Like "doo-doo, doo-doo, dun, doo-doo"
You'll always be my baby
Ask me what we're doing
Yeah, you know that drive me crazy
She wanna ride with the top way down
When I get her home I'ma lay that down
Lay that down, oh-oh

[Hook]

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up

[Verse 2]
In the year 3005
And the world I love is gone
Do you know where we're headed?
I see now, I know love

I can do anything
I just wanna sing
I just wanna dance, now
I'm so free you know, know
I can't help myself, no
Oh my god, oh my god

[Hook]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you

[Hook]

One love

[Verse 1]
Bino, I'm so for real-o, green like I'm Cee Lo
Hangin' out with Kilo... Kish, smokin' on that keisha
I'mma need that visa
I'm working on everything that I'm touching man
I'm bussin' two white Russians drinking themselves
But it's still ain't nothing yo
It's East side if you can't tell, North Decatur and Glendale
So fuck y'all, all y'all, if y'all don't like me... good
Put that on my partner man, I wish a nigga would
I say we ain't playing man I hope that's understood
I'm in my zone though, fucking round with that 4-0
Eating my mamas salmon but skipping on the risotto
Girl said that she need the follow, tweet her and she'll do any
Man, I'm trying to stay off, readin' em makes me angry
On the back on the tour bus, recording the two of us
Stacks at the Apple store, man this ballin' is new to us
Trying to make amends, bailing on all my friends
Niggas went to the club, sent a beat to Gucci instead
Man I'm feelin' right, my nigga Fam yelling "don't stop"
And half my crew is always faded on some lowtop
Stopped drinking for the most part
My only vices all our pictures on my laptop
Screaming at me saying "I ain't what you really want"
Christina's parents baby all I make is Milians
We got the shows, we got the paper, but I want respect
So tell them haters we ain't quitting yet
Let 'em know

[Hook]
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known

I shoulda known, shoulda known

[Verse 2]
One love, the thing that hasn't changed
My parents lost their job, it's so cold in the A
Now that I'm 1%, I send most of it home
I want to stunt but she need to pay off her student loans
And everybody saying, "Get it while you hitting man
We want them harder beats, that 808 you slipping man"
Dude is so stupid popping anything they hand me
On that parking lot pimping and politicking in Miami
In that home of the D where they sell that cake batter
Heard a voice in the back, hate from all the fake rappers
That I shitted on, shitted on
Shitted on, shitted on
Rap your soul, dude, let the mic blaze
Show 'em A-Town, East Side, all day
I put it on, I put it on
I put it on, I put it on
Life is somethin' IMAX, film is at a climax
I ain't even started, Was it stupid I departed?
Man, probably, but now we do the things we always wanted
I'm proud of me, cause I am undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with
Please somebody cum laude me
Graduated, anticipated the hatred and doubted me
Not a prodigy, just a hard worker from the Dean's List
But most these rappers doin' so-so like a seamstress
Jesus

[Hook]
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known
One love

I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known



[Verse 1: Beck]
Centrifugal force pulling me off-course, in a horse race
Changing horses midstream, fourteenth place
On videotape surveillance playback
Sigh you lose face, disgraced, God forbid you
Fall off of the face of the Earth to chase
The black hole of what you thought it was worth today
"Don't shoot the piano player" I heard them say
It was your fault, centrifugal force, you got caught
Convict monotonous, a verdict thoughtless
As you read it out loud, at least I was being relatively honest
Standing in your office trying to speak to some anacondas
Eking solace out of the sawdust
While your doppleganger stands topless
No one notices, they got their own dramas
Drama-rama's melodramas
You draw commas on the eyes of madonnas
And wonder why you can't turn traumas into nirvanas

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Don't mess your head up, still run with these young bucks
Still runnin' on jet fuel, still pimpin' on what-what
What was I thinkin'? I wasn't
What am I drinkin'? I'm buzzin'
Speakin' of weekends I used to fuck with your cousin
I used to rap about nothin', now I rap about nothin'
But that nothin' was somethin' that ain't nobody was bumpin'
See I still got it boo-boo, just a dad'll do you
Wonders if you don't wanna be under some gross dude
But most girls will do it just for a corner seat at Nobu
I bet your daughter's perfect, he say it like he know you
My daughter isn't living yet, Atwater Village idiot
Their flow's dumb, but that royalty's the silliest
Now

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
Someone tell these niggas I ain't fuckin' 'round
Fly them all to Vegas man we hold it down
Livin' for the present, nigga we fuck futures
Sippin' on some whiskey, these bitches drinkin' Kombucha
Recession means more oppression, these niggas will shoot ya
Rio de Janeiro, these bitches lookin' like Xuxa
Talk with anacondas, at least I'm bein' honest
I'm tryin' to turn these Keke Palmers into baby mamas
Baby mama, I'm your baby, mama
Man, let your boy drown, they ain't save me, momma
They ain't save me momma
They ain't save me momma
Silk pillow for that new weave
Silk pillow for that new weave



[Verse 1]
You are the bestest, I will obey you
They wanna know what, I couldn't say who
You are the only one who's ever really seen me
I know that I'm the reason that you don't watch any TV
I wanna lay on your stomach so bad
And it gets a little quiet in this bachelor pad
And I don't really understand the thing we had
I wanna try again, but it would just be sad
And oh, oh whoa
You are the only one who's ever let me be me

[Bridge]
We can make it easy, we can do it simple
I'll be waiting right there, promise to be gentle
Sitting by your window, girl, you're so fly to me

[Chorus]
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly to me
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly to me

[Segue]
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
[?] tonight
I won't let you down, oh
Oh

[Bridge]
We can make it easy, we can do it simple
I'll be waiting right there, promise to be gentle
Sitting by your window, girl, you're so fly to me

[Chorus]
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly to me
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly
So fly, girl, you're so fly to me

[Hook]
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
Now I'm so high
Now I'm so high
Now I'm so high

[Verse 1]
Girl, what's your problem
Cause I know it's hard sometimes, baby just give it some time
Oh honey now girl, we can solve them
If you just give me some time I can open up your mind
If you le-le-let it shine, you can free-ee-ee your mind
Cause I know

[Hook]
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober

[Verse 2]
Girl, if it's done right
Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me
Oh honey now girl, give it one night
If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan
Cause I know one day you'll see
All the things that we can be
No, no, no...

[Bridge]
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
(I want to be the only one)
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so

(Now I'm so high)
(Now I'm so high)
(Now I'm so high)
(Now I'm so high...)

[Outro]
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
Now I'm so high
Now I'm so high
Now I'm so high
Now I'm so high
Now I'm so high...



[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
When the sun is rising over streets so barren
Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92
I listened to what my father said

[Hook]
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can, when you can

[Verse 2]
How this used to feel so far and free
Now these broken souls are all I see
Fists have fallen to our side
We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed
But my mama said

[Hook]
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
Oh I, nah, nah, nah
If you are strong, you cannot fall
If you are strong, oh no
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can, when you can
[Part 2]

[Verse 3]
If you cannot, oh!
There is more to you and me
There is more than they can see
I'm on your side, woo, oh
There is more out there
And somebody cares 'bout you
I do

[Interlude]
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
There is more out there
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall

[Outro]
Oh!
Give me a moment, oh, oh, oh
When they're gone, keep to yourself
Oh, oh, woo, oh, ooh, yeah!
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Oh! Oh!
Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
(Thanks for doing that, thank you)
Oh! Oh!
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Ooh! Oh!



[Verse 1]
Yeah nigga, it's me again
I'm still around, I guess I win
You hear me in your sister's room like all the time
Gambino Girl forever on that bracelet that she bought online
To dudes who couldn't take it, might I say, "hasta luego"
Cause I'm taking all your city like I'm Carmen San Diego
I'm smoking, I'm on fire
I am blazin', don't get hurt
To my white dudes it's a concert
To my black nerds this is church
From that NYU dorm to The Emory
Everyone hated me, I'm more hip hop than you'll ever be
Im bustin', bustin' bustin', bustin' on these niggas man
And nothin, nothing nothin, nothin is the same again
You lookin dumb as hell man for ever sleepin' on him
Your girl is not around, she busy sleepin on him
Will he fail?
Now that's the wrong conversation
Terry Gross on the mic, I'm the talk of the nation, uh

[Hook]
Hey, what it do bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit

Hey, what it do bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit

[Verse 2]
New shit
You didn't know?
Black rock like a fuckin' LOST episode
Somethin' for these black kids to call they own
So when you skatin' in your driveway, you not alone
She stay down like that new coat that I bought her
And the fly Rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water
And I'm lookin' at her butt
Thats that 20/20 hindsight
My shit be Jackson, Jordan, Bolton, Keaton, Tyson: 5 Mikes
Donald Glover, no relation
Always workin', no vacation
They couldn't feel me, no vocation
Murder verses the only motive was motivation
Money equals freedom
I've wanted this since a three-year-old
I've seen it all, like I'm John Mayer's penis hole
Bein' me, that's something that's so unusual
I've seen the future, and the future go

[Hook]
Hey, what it do bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit

Hey, what it do bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit

[Outro]
Can't you hear me baby?
Can't you hear me callin' out your name?
Can't you hear me baby?
Oh, can't you hear me callin' out your name?



[Verse: Childish Gambino]
There's a bottom to the top of a moment
You won't always be around
Catch a nigga coming quickly behind you
People want you underground
Do you misbehave?
Haunt you to your grave
I'm going to eat you alive
Please don't find me rude
But I don't eat fast food
So don't run too fast

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh

[Post-Hook: Childish Gambino]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, ooh

[Outro: JD McCrary]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, please
Ooh-oh, no, no, no, ooh!
Oh, you can't run from me
You can't hide from me



[Hook]
All these haters
See you later
All that I could do
But you dont even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh oh

[Verse 1]
So CG but a nigga stay real
Though I'm fly I'm ill I'm running shit
3-points, field goal
Rappers used to laugh like I tripped and fell
Cause I don't stunt a gold cross like I Christian bail
Yeah, they starin' at me jealous cause I do shows bigger
But your looks don't help, like an old gold digger
Uncool, but lyrically I'm a stone cold killer
So it's 400 blows to these Truffaut niggas
Yeah, now that's the line of the century
Niggas missed it, too busy, they lyin' 'bout penitentiary
Man, you ain't been there, nigga you been scared
And I'm still living single like Synclaire
Lovin' white dudes who call me white and then try to hate
When I wasn’t white enough to use your pool when I was 8
Stone Mountain, you raised me well
I’m stared at by Confederates but hard as hell
Tight jeans penny loafers, but I still drink a four dime
Staying on my me shit, but hated on by both sides
I’m just a kid who blowing up with my father’s name
And every black "you're not black enough"
Is a white "you're all the same"
Mm Food like Rapp Snitch Knishes
Cuz it's oreos, twinkies, coconuts, delicious
How many gold plaques you want inside your dining room?
I said I want a full house
They said, "You got it dude!"

[Hook]
All these haters
See you later
All that I could do
But you dont even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh oh

[Verse 2]
Holla, holla, holla, holla at yo boy
Like yo dad when he's pissed off
Got flow, I could make a cripple crip walk
Niggas' breath stank, all they do is shit talk
People want a real man, I made 'em wait this long
Maybe if he bombs, he'll quit and keep actin'
And save paper like your aunt does with McDonald napkins
How'd it happen? Honesty did it
See all of my competition at the bodies exhibit
Yeah I bodied the limits and I deaded them fakers
Motherfuck if you hate it, cremated them haters
So, my studio be a funeral
Yeah, this is our year, oh you didn't know?
Uh, yeah I'm killin' you, step inside the lion's den
Man I'm hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead
On stage with my family in front of me
I am what I am: everything I wanna be

[Hook]
All these haters
See you later
All that I could do
But you dont even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh oh

[Outro]
This is on a bus back from camp
I’m thirteen and so are you
Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
I hadn’t met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble
It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That’s you
And we’re still at camp as long as we’re on the bus
And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
We’re still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles
I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you
But I don’t know if you do or don’t more-than-like me
You’ve never said, so I haven’t been saying anything all summer
Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
A girl who’s smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh
Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
A girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her
Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet

Back in the real world we don’t go to the same school
And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
We won’t go to the same high school
So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something
And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
The sun’s gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep
We’re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
That looks like a kid we know
And then I’m like, “Can I tell you something?”
And all of a sudden I’m telling you
And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
And your face is there and gone and there and gone
As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
And there’s no expression on it
And I think just after a point I’m just talking to lengthen the time
Where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet
And regrettably I end up using the word “destiny”
I don’t remember in what context. Doesn’t really matter
Before long I’m out of stuff to say and you smile and say, “okay”
I don’t know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive
And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
But there’s nowhere to go because we’re on a bus
So I pretend like I’m asleep and before long, I really am

I wake up, the bus isn’t moving anymore
The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
I turn and you’re not there
Then again a lot of kids aren’t in their seats anymore
We’re parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad’s car by now
Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
Just as one of them reaches my row
It used to be our row, on our way off
It’s Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
After throwing rocks at my head
Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise
She stops and looks down at me
And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can’t really see her face
But I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny”
Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
And then she turns and leads them off the bus
I didn’t know you were friends with them

I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over
So is summer, even though there’s two weeks until school starts
This isn’t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
This is a story about how I learned something and I’m not saying this thing is true or not
I’m just saying it’s what I learned
I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody
So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always
Everybody can’t turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them
But this means there isn’t a place in my life for you or someone like you
Is it sad? Sure. But it’s a sadness I chose
I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
And got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit
But that’s not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus
I still haven’t...



[Verse]
I'm the last of a dying breed
Meaning that I’m not afraid to try a new thing
Can't see me, best to get yourself some Visine
Toe tag a motherfucker, no jokes, while these other niggas "wakka wakka"
Other rappers try and go and get over
You want that hood shit? Best to go and call Hova
I was a good kid, backpack on my shoulder
98 test score in my ThunderCat folder
My cousin was older
My momma used to wake up
Drive me to his school cause his school was much safer
But I slipped up and accidentally told a teacher
Now I'm going to a school where I get beat up because
I ain't get down with them other kids
Probably cause I talk too white and I got a dad who's there
Momma couldn't take it, sold the place and got us out of there
Guest room, now the six of us splitting one with a restroom
Now I'm going to this school called Rockbridge
School of the neighborhood we tryna buy a house in
There's not a lot of black kids
So I stick out like a sore thumb with some bad acne, but really
What I wanna know is why I never fit in right
Like a fat dude getting on a packed flight
Even when I make friends in the hallways
I'm wishing I was someone else always
But I'm happy that that shit happened to me
Cause it taught me most important is to do me
Cause everybody hates you till they love you
Facebook niggas same niggas that would shove you
Cause nobody was jocking my style
Cause I had a high voice, they called me faggot 8 Mile
So I stopped writing for a very long time
Thinkin' that a nigga wasn't made to bust rhymes
And this next part, sounds like nonsense
But I swear to God, Tina Fey gave me confidence
Taught me everything that is good comes from honesty
Everybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it
She on a role model, shit
From the day that I shook her hand
I knew that I'd never die a broke man
So I could try this rapping shit out again
The game need change, I'm a part of it
People tell me I should spit under Donald Glover
But I try to keep my real name undercover
Cause if you hear my name, then you think it's jokes
And I can't go for that, nigga; Hall and Oates
My nigga stay down like a winter coat
I rap about my life, not "I'm On a Boat"
Cause this joke rap shit's gotten out of hand
Only ones who do it well's Lonely Island
Save the raps about your cat, I am not a fan
Leave the joke raps alone, man I'm working here
I do not play around with this bullshit
I am different, call it new shit
Labels want me to hurry and cash my check in
But I keep my shit free till the last possible second
Cause God knows that I don't need the money
You get your clothes free when you rich, ain't it funny?
But this limelight burn like a motherfuck
I wanna call my dad crying but I hang up
Cause I don't want him to worry, he's got his own shit
So I send him a check and tell him to hold it
If anything ever happens want you to know this
I always took the time to smell the roses
And wherever I am, I am doing fine
I'm here for a good, not a long, time



[Pages of a book being riffled through]



[Hook]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you

[Verse 1]
First off let me say I'm drunk off of shitty wine
So I'll probably use the B word a couple times
I used to love your fucking mouth, you had enough of mine
But what's the reason for, you never gave me any sign
When we were making out you kind of act like it was nothing
Like you were doing it to prove you could do it or something
You know I'm fine with getting fucked by girls who are my friends
You fucked me in a different way, I guess it all depends
Texting on my day off, "Hey babe what's going on?"
"Sorry I can't make it out", sad face emoticon
It's funny how I see you with these bad boys you hanging on
I told ya I'm a soldier need a girl scout to tag-a-long
Face down ass up, that's the way you left me
I thought there was a spark but we were missing Lisa Leslie
"You know it's fucking childish to write a song to get me"
I'm always fucking childish you knew that when you met me

[Hook]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you

[Verse 2]
You ain't that fine bitch what the fuck you heard?
I love these shitty ass chicks I guess I'll never learn
I hate it when you think you really getting something good
And you don't listen to your dudes when you really should
I got so many fucking girls I can't even count 'em
There's probably six or seven girls who think this song's about them
Never kiss in public but at home I am affectionate
Fucking bitches left and right my dick is ambidextrous
I know you probably texting this lyric to your friends
Saying "This nigga think he all that. He fucking sucked in bed", well uhh…
I think we both know that I worked that ass
I hope your dude can keep it stretched, yoga class
I'm trying hard not to use a specific reference
But you'll probably know that it's you after the first sentence
So let me quit while I'm ahead like a penis tip
If I never was in love with you I hope you know I'm meaning it

[Hook - 2x]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you


Nobody really wants you
Nobody really wants you
Nobody really wants you, wants you, wants you



[Instrumental + Harmonization]



[Verse]
I used to play the fool all by myself
It used to make me feel real good
I used to eat my food all by myself
I used to do the dishes too
I used to break your heart all by myself
I used to be the only one around

[Hook 1]
Be yourself, there's no understanding something that happened that night
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no no no
There is no understanding, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook 2]
Be yourself, there's no understanding something that happened that night
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
There is no understanding
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
No understanding what happened that night, baby
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
Oh, there is no
With you, with you



[Intro]
Oh no, no, yeah

[Verse 1]
I know the secret we share
Look what this feeling has done to me
There's something deep in the air
Just hope your hands lift me comfortably

[Bridge 1]
I don't know why but every time I see you smiling
I'm tired of running tired of playing tired of hiding
If we could be together would that make you happy?
And If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me
(I'm just playing tho)

[Hook]
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen

[Verse 2]
I think there's something for us
Lying around as the world comes down
If you understand what I'm saying
You won't end up in the lost and found, nope

[Bridge 2]
I don't know why but every time I see you dancing
(I see you dancing)
I'm tired of running tired of playing late romancing
(I don't want to)
If we could be together would that make you happy?
(I don't fuck with that)
And if it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me

[Hook]
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen

[Verse 3]
Now why can't every day be like this
Smoke a  J at the beach like this
Hang with bae at the beach like this
Conversations with Kish like this (hey!)
Never thought it could be like this
Be the man like I am like this
Dance around shake your hips like this
Mess around make a hit like this

[Outro]
Like this, like this, no
Always be like this, no
Like this, like this, like this, no
Always be like this, no
Like this, always be like this
Like this, like this, like this



[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
We are really close and this party's really loud
We should go outside and talk, better yet, let's take a cab
We're kissing in the back, my apartment's pretty close
Baby, let me make you breakfast, an omelet with some toast
These girls are on my mind, wasn't my design
To be sitting here across from you, pretending I ain't lyin'
I know exactly how you feel, I wanna keep it real
I never thought that I'd be working for the start cause

[Hook: Garfunkel & Oates]
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
I know this thing will never last
I need to tear it all apart
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I can lose it all

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
I don't have the heart, fuck it, I don't have the head
Every time that we're apart, someone's sleeping in my bed
I wanna be alone, I wanna be alone
This fame and fortune shit shows me things I wasn't knownin'
You're my biggest fan, I promise to be there
I wanna be that guy, but I don't think I can
I'm losing everything, I wanna let it go
I wanna take it right and slow because

[Hook: Garfunkel & Oates]
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
I know this thing will never last
I need to tear it all apart
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I can lose it all



[Intro: Childish Gambino]
Somebody tell they people what the fuck is up
I'm grindin' like a doozer looking cool as fuck
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I sell the stage
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I'm gettin' paid

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Eddy Scissorhands is workin' on my linin'
Gettin' spiffy for these bitches I be eyeing
Fredward Mercury was playin' while I'm ridin'
Down the Ryan, in a Scion
And I'm flyin', but it's cool, I got insurance
On the run because I got warrants, but it's cool I got endurance
In school I got suspended, but in turn I got some earnings
Could've spent it all on Thursday, but I saved it for my parents
But I spent a bit on Friday, in the night I hang with Donald
I'm tired of McDonalds, want a chick that cook chicano
That can't speak a lick of English, and pronounce my name like Chano
She say "something, something" Spanish
I look back like, "Bitch, I know"
Tonight, I'mma make decisions for life
Take some lucy's boomer's dark liq' and light, some might drive
That's that shit right there that I don't like
There that shit just had to say
Shouts to the niggas that passed away
And shots for the niggas that's here right now
And shots at the niggas that got away
So sad to say, but it's all good
Niggas gon' celebrate, and wait for the day
And wait for the day shit detonate, with Alize
Like live from the Chi', it's Saturday night

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Used to have some patience, now it's all gone
Force feed these motherfuckers eatin' foie gras
Force feed these motherfuckers not a rockstar
I'm a say my piece, these other rappers lockjaw
I don't think they like me (I don't think they like me)
I don't think I'm icy, I think I'm aight, B
Niggas wanna fight me? That's unnecessary
I don't quit for shit, that's my legendary

[Outro]



[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Flow so pneumonia, yo bitch want my boner
I take her round the corner then I gave the ho a bonus
Bitches wanna bone us, we ain't cubic zirconia
But I will never own 'em so to me them bitches loners
On the deck, and a tongue flip like the "my" in "My Sharona"
Got her drip, drip, drippin' like that lemon and Corona
Bank roll thick like that neck on Sabonis
But I will never trick, you just get dick and balonis
Take that tenderoni, and now she ride my pony
And cheese came with it like a snatch of pepperoni
I'm an O.G., I'm with CG
You a he-she, nigga run you back like a repeat
I'm a pill poppin' ET, Givenchy on a ten-speed
Hot like Britney in '03, ya know me
Smokin' on that Toxic, sippin' on an O.E
Dippin' in that Molly got me higher than some Flow C

[Hook]
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Fandango my mandingo, we should do a movie
Groupies lookin' like the Yakuza in my Jacuzzi
Excuse me I'm on that ooey, my pockets are life with Louis
Euros is different colors, my wallet look like a Coogi
He who speakin' the least is Chief Keefin' the peace
Leavin' seeds in yo niece, prayin' that she ain't late
Sprayin' like that AK, now that shit my namesake
'Bino you so nasty, ass like an ashtray
Smokin' Flying Lotus, used to be Jehovah's
I'm in yo girl and now she feeling Polish like pierogies
They hopin' that they smoke us
N'aw man, never that
Trippin' off that earwax, Danny Brown and D-Stacks
Ill pandemic, man that shit be everywhere
Midas is your highness and you Haribo like Gummi bears
Why I'm fly like a cockpit, you don't fly like a ostrich
Stupid shit like a mosh pit, can't believe this is "Toxic"

[Hook]
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down



[Intro]
Gambino: Yeah, where'd you guys go?

Girls: To where, In Atlanta?

Strip Club Queen: When I used to live here, I was the strip club queen

Fam: Wait, wait, so what's up with Follies? Like lemme know

Strip Club Queen: Follies is my favorite strip club ever, in Atlanta

Gambino: Follies is the realest

Strip Club Queen: I swear to god-Follies is the realest, more-so because they have international bitches in there, you got bitches from Cambodia, you got bitches from fucking Italy, you got bitches from fucking Africa, you got bitches from...Kansas, you got bitches from everywhere in Follies

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Situations will arise, in our lives
But you gotta be smart about it
Celebrations, with the guys
I sacrificed, cause you could not sleep without it
Girl I, cause I loved you
You were my girl
See I, thought the world of you
But so you know
You don't have to call baby no
Cause I'mma be alright tonight
You don't have to call baby no
I'mma be alright tonight

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
I mean
I waited, and waited, and waited
For that phone call
And then I served you what she was asking for
Nah, you ain't gotta make that call now
Stone Mountain, yeah, you started running that thing after us

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
(Don't you ever go away)
We are very rare
(Please don't leave me girl)
10% of a foster home trying to Cinderella this shit
This melanin pit they placed us in and said get out
(I always knew baby)
No blueprint, hell's cruise ship
(You don't have to call, just text me)
Took him and her, who made him and her
Who made him and her who made her
Who ran away from the south at 14 pregnant
Who made her who came back to the south
Atlanta, Georgia who made me
Funny hairline, white name
Blonde dreads, African name , both of our parents
Original black hippies, so what?
(Deep inside, I'm deep inside your heart)
(Please don't call me girl)
Little 5 points to Avondale to Stone Crest
You out in Lithonia though
But fuck that, I'm a high class nigga
I catch you out at Lenox
Nah fuck that, I'm looking for hoes at Atlantic Station
Nah fuck that, I'm at South DeKalb Mall
Really in the parking lot, leaning on some broke niggas Camry
The pic you sent last night says you really with the shits
(You wanna go, you know where i am)
My leather passenger seat exhales
Wasn't ready for all that
Cause it's not me
I mean who is right?
(I just wanna die, i just wanna die, inside of your love)
I'mma take you to Tongue & Groove
There's $20 to wear my hat inside
I give em $100 and tell em to pay forward for the niggas behind me
They playing Jeezy like that shit came out yesterday
Thug motivation, I was never a thug and they used to respect me for it
But now the game's fucked up and I gotta Michael Corleone these niggas
Quiet, confident, I talked to her
She came with you, but she left with me
And now she's in the passenger seat
So, where we going?
Just away
Which leaves you standing there thinking
You don't have to call, baby



[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Who the fuck, Gambino, this nigga on your TiVo?
My hotel cost a kilo, banking like a free throw
Fuck y'all, we A-Team, y'all plan B like Walgreens
Cop that shit and paint it black, niggas want they summer back?
Ha-ha, no way, hublots, Dolce
Beans in my hand, girl in the car
She still with her man, but she seeing me tomorrow
Homegirl on that Master P, watch us ball like referees
Unnecessary roughness? We just trying to function
Used to sport them Filas cause my cousin pack them heaters
We don't wife 'em like Khalifa, we just party then we leave 'em
Tell 'em that we hittin', we don't really see 'em
My girl look best when she only wear a fitted
Q and 'Bino in the house and you niggas in the senate
Get it?

[Hook]
Four thou' on my fit, that's unnecessary
Skiing in Japan, that's unnecessary
Molly on my rider, that's unnecessary
'Bino spit the fire, that ain't even necessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
Roll out on a plane, that's unnecessary
'Tussin and champagne, nigga that ain't even necessary

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
They said don’t buy the belt and I got it
They said don’t get the Rollie and I bought it
Nigga, I’m balling
My fucking mixtape can get you through college
Getting them dollars
Showing my pearly white teeth, I'm a nigga that’s flawless
Came a long way from dumping out Impalas
Same gun and pants, different ski mask from coppers
All of this copper
Knock knock, who could it be? Niggas know I got it on lock
Yawk, yawk - bitch rappers better move ‘fore them niggas get dropped
Mr. Flop boy, you got your label hot
I’m the hardest out, you's a table cloth
Unnecessary balling, I was carted off
Been fucking with my side bitch so much my main bitch can’t stand it
Hunned racks in three months, man this shit is outstanding
Seen a dollar go to stupid racks, billion, trillion
Nigga, that’s what I call building
‘Bino what it do, let’s go half on a million

[Hook]
Bathroom DVR, that’s unnecessary
Pushing in that bulletproof, that’s unnecessary
Stunting in the mall, that’s unnecessary
Condo on my arm, that ain't even necessary
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary
Ibiza for a day, that’s unnecessary
Shows a hundred K, that ain’t even necessary

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Black Lip Bastard
Actual natural disaster
I did a song about DMT
Soulja Boy did one right after
3 eyes, these guys ain’t seeing me
No radio showed up over B.o.B
G-O-D Emcee
I’m the devil with angel wings
Pilot Talk, currency
Stole the show, burglary
I love that flow but I got more
Open condoms in condos
Open bottles of Moet
White with white girls in Eugene
We used to call hoes on 3-way
And take 'em out to the movies
And now we just do it our way
She driving stick in the driveway
Just popped a molly with Miley
She do shrooms every blue moon
Hundred million trillion muthafuckin' racks nigga
Pinot grigio the lean’ll go in that nigga
Now that's unnecessary
Been a legend since elementary
Ayo, Bino, tell these niggas I ain't no joke
She don't need speak, she ain't giving no throat
You are under my control
Suspend the L's but I'm on a roll
Grade A, honor roll
Mayday, Soul!



[Hook]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till 3005, hold up

[Verse 1]
Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up

[Hook]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till 3005
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (say what)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)...

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till 3005
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)...

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hold up

[Hook]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till 3005, hold up

[Spoken Outro]

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till 3005
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)...

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up...

[Outro]
We did it! Yay!
Nigga, you so thirsty

[Verse 1]
Picking out my fro with my fist comb
I got a tab at the Stone baby, this long
My little brother was having a little trouble
I hope that he doesn't care that it's in this song
Koreatown lunchin', talking 'bout how to run things
He said Atlanta wanted something
Waka, Jeezy, and Future got the streets locked down
Copycats making sure Tip keep that crown
I'm fucking 'round with the truth, went to see The Roots
Quest brought me back on stage in a suit
I went hard cause niggas say that I'm soft
Even Black Thought thought I maimed it a little hard, I gotta be honest
Feeling like the other stuff is kinda behind us
Making jokes here and there done got us some dollars
I'm tryna show the whole world what it is and it ain't a game
He said homie stay the course, ain't shit changed
Weird night and everybody was tipsy
Hanging out with Questlove reminiscing 'bout Whitney
He like, "Man, we can't even make it to 50?!"
That reminds me - I sent a long text message to my mom and pop
I got the same speech when I left 30 Rock
My mom like "Why you wanna leave a good job?"
My dad like "Do your thing, boy, don't stop"
Shout out to my nigga Lud, shout out to my nigga Swank
For hanging at the crib and telling me what you think
Speak from your heart and never compromise what you feel is real
And never let these white people tell you how to feel
Never let anybody tell you how to feel
I wanted what they had back in the fourth grade
Family vacas, you know I did it all
Just to see my little sis by a waterfall
My great granddad bought his own freedom
Walk barefoot to Virginia to start his own peanut farm
So don't be alarmed - man I'm royalty
Jam of the week, V103
No cosign, no bovine
More swag, pull back on the punchlines
Starving, every track means lunch time
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
Fuck boys chase hype and scrat chicks
And niggas who stopped texting after 1.6
DG Lover ain't nothing to fuck wit'
D-Money ain't nothing to fuck wit'
And what's a leader if he isn't reluctant
Too bad for y'all, I'm blasting off
I'm not Asher Roth, I don't sleep on my bread
Dick riders stay close, I might flash a ball
Sometimes, all this shit make a nigga feel guilty
I used to sleep with them roaches
Back of my mind though, I hope the show gets cancelled
Maybe then I can focus
Hawaii touch down, go ahead baby put your shades on
East Side! East Side to the gravestone!
Brown liquor, but my girl in Bed-Stuy
Nigga, you got Drive like a sale at Best Buy
Hold up, hold up, we can do better
Put my voice on the track, man that shit is much wetter
At the studio at 8 AM
Hit the booth then eat, nigga we ain't them, nigga we ain't them!
Drop a line, it's your Facebook status
Said that shit about a week ago, you still mad at us
If there's something on your chest, nigga let it out
Cause I'm the best - da da da



[Hook: Josh Osho]
We finally made it
And now we sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps asking
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
You can call the shots, I’m going to my aunt’s house
What’s it all about? Lookin’ like I’m Millhouse
What’s it all about? I ain’t get my bike back
I ain’t get my bike back, I know where he live at
I know what he look like, I know what I live like
Five to a bed, head to toe, that’s a good night
Five to a bed, head to toe, with the fan on
I don’t think these other niggas know what your man on
I used to have to sneak just to get my food
Free lunch made it feel like they don’t approve
Sell a card for a dollar used to be the move
I wanna be Jabari man that nigga cool
I wanna lash out nigga keep your cool
All my friend did was draw something now he outta school
‘Cuz everything was always “Show me what you’re made of”
And everybody knew somebody who was laid up
I didn’t need it, momma said it’s a lesson
Some people will never like you
Don’t let’em catch you stressin’
You know a code’s a code, the world can’t stop’em
Eating out rat holes and Cheerios boxes
This nigga think he hot shit, he think he good at everything
I just didn’t wanna get left out more
My little sis’ mom got shot, she in the newspaper
Prayers couldn’t save her, she died a day later
Like my cousin got the HIV
When she bust the leg open playing jump rope
Should I tell them kids what the fuck’s up?
They gone judge her and me
Man fuck them, we livin’, all is forgiven
I fucked up royally
But now that’s who we are man you gotta use the royal "we"
This is royalty, and this is all I ever wanted ‘cuz

[Hook: Josh Osho]
We finally made it
And now we sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps asking
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
We finally made it
And now we sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps asking
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful



[Hook: Danielle Haim]
We are so far away from here

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
Tell 'em run it back, this song is my shit
Told that DJ "Turn it up!", all we did was Blowflex (woo)
It’s that Stone Mountain, DeKalb county
Fuck boys know shit about me
Still real, no shit, cash gun; money clip
285 to 400 then I made a left (yeah)
Man we spend it up in Lenox, boy, we fresh to death
They be sleeping when I left, now they heard of me
We get paid to keep y’all hyped, that’s that turnip green
New kicks, street ball, black top, asphalt
Tight dress, her ass fault, get face like bath salts
Airport atheist, only pray when there's turbulence
So why the fuck am I stressin’ over this nervous shit?

[Hook: Danielle Haim]
We are so far away from here
We are so far away from here

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
Burn, burn, burn
My new car, my new clothes
Now that I’m on top, are you proud of me?
Burn, burn, burn
My new car, my new clothes
Now that I won't stop, are you proud of me?

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I’m on top, are you proud of me, proud of me?
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I’m on top, are you proud of me, proud of me?

Are you proud of me?
Are you proud of me?
I should have known



[Verse 1]
(Bitch, you know me)
If you don't like this shit I'm puttin' out, then you can blow me
These dollars in my pocket getting big, I gotta fold it
It's Cheezy in the building, more cheese than macaroni
What the fuck is going on?
I'm in her bush, before I eat, I make her mow the lawn
My career is like award shows, it's going long
I make it look real easy, like I'm showing thong, huh
(Bitch, you know me)
I do a shot, and then I'll sip a Sobe
I'm walking weird cause it's Walker that I'm wasted on
People just realizing that I'm awesome, why they take so long?
Skip around the album, it's not hard to find your favorite song
Pussy and these tracks the only things that I go crazy on
Let me slow it down a sec, man, I cannot not be sick
Hook me up with Dimetapp
(Bitch, you know me)
You think you better than I am, then show me
These niggas don't talk that much shit unless you let them
And I let them, cause they know if you reply, then you respect them
I've been working for a minute, hope this album's a success
I'm not tryna to do Drake numbers, I'm just tryna do my best
Cause let's face it, if I wasn't working with Tina on pitches
I would probably flood the market, and go Katrina, you bitches, uh

[Verse 2]
(Bitch, you know me)
I'm sorry mama, but there isn't an old me
That nigga dead, but I promise, he won't die in vain
All I trust is money, fuck these niggas like the Crying Game
This is not a joke. You won't listen to what I'm sayin'
And I promise to destroy any nigga who think I'm playin'
Know my verses can be silly, but I'm choosing not to spray rounds
My verse is pedophiles on the playground, okay now?
(Bitch, you know me)
Half-price flat screens, yes, I work for Sony
I kiss her hard and hit the jet, I make out like a bandit
They trying hard to hate me, I just don't understand it
Screamin' at me, "When you gonna stick to the right business
And stop making rap music for these White kids-es?"
Huh, I make music for these tight kids
Don't be a fucking asshole, one day, you'll have to wipe his
(Bitch, you know me)
I know what I am, and I'll never be hovy
Cause I am just different, I'm being what I am, man
I don't need a Jesus piece, my jacket cost me 10 grand
I'm going light speed, and I don't care if you can't see us
Cause I will never stop, like I am cruising in a Prius
You talk from far away because my money's between us
And I'm working hard as hell, until I'm chilling with Aaliyah
Bitch, you know me
Bitch



[Hook]
I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA

[Verse 1]
I'm on my ish... call it
I watch these haters take they shots like they were alcoholics
"What is he wearing? Somebody jack that fool's steeze"
If I'm a faggot spell it right, I got way more than two G's
Nigga I'm amazing, I'm a phenom
I'm assassin, I'mma kill y'all
I'mma say ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa
And this shit's closed now cause I ball too hard
And I'm cumming on her face, have I gone too far?
I don't know, who cares, I don't love that broad
And it's funny how these fake niggas always act hard
I'm a black star in a black car with a black card
They wanna knock me out
They tryin nigga
Realest motherfucker in the game like Tron, nigga
Forget these white girls
I need some variation
Especially if she very Asian
She got an ugly friend? Roll solo
Can I stay at your place? No hobo
Not my fault, man, these ladies love me
She's an overachiever cause all she do is succeed

[Hook]
I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA

[Verse 2]
Send me naked pics, I’mma Tumbl that
I’m the shit, been the shit, fuck a humble brag
Yeah we pushin’ that, and her pussycat
I got swag out my ass so I’m usin’ that
Texting with Olivia Munn, hopefully she’ll give me some
Or some Rosie Jones, man
Hoes is hoes is hoes, man
Racks on racks on racks, man
All I got is tracks, man
Sorry for my accent, but I’ve been practicin’
Everywhere ya go niggas blastin’ that Gambino
Niggas be like, "You ain't know?"
Bitches be like, "You ain't know?"
Met this fly Latino
Hope that she eighteen though
If she not, I’ll say that I got deep throat in Heathrow

[Hook]
I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA

[Verse 3]
Told me I was shit, but that shit couldn't stop me
Nigga still hungry, black Kobayashi
When I talk about you I hear a "Who?" like Horton
I was born for this shit, you a rappin' abortion
Can we hear the N-word one day and not get upset?
Can we try something new and not be suspect?
I don’t really know, we fucked up bad
You don’t wanna see my dudes when they get mad
I got a bunch of jackanapes at the back of me
That’ll lacerate anyone in the back of a matinee
And laugh while they masturbatin' all over your beaten body
Sick Boi forever, that Suburban Illuminati
Naw nigga, yeah, we never stop
No period like menopause
No period like, "Oh shit! Am I the only one you sleepin' with?"
"Am I the only one you sleepin' with?"



[Intro: Kari Faux]
(That's right)
(That's right)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino & Kari Faux]
All I see is zombies
Walking all around us
You can hear them coming
(They come to take your life)
You can hear them breathing
Breathing down your spine, oh

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
All I see is zombies
Hear them screaming at her
They can smell your money
And they want your soul
Here they come behind you
Try to stay alive

[Chorus: Kari Faux & Childish Gambino]
We're coming out to get you
We're all so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it
You will find there is no safe place to hide, hide
(That's right, that's right)
(That's right, that's right)

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino & Kari Faux]
All I see is zombies
Feeding all around us
All they eat are people
(And you won't survive)
They don't know what happened
They just stay alive

[Chorus: Kari Faux & Childish Gambino]
We're coming out to get you
We're all so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it
There is no way to stop it
You will find there is no safe place to hide
(That's right, that's right)

[Bridge: Kari Faux]
We're coming out to get you
We're all so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it
There is no way to stop it

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Do you feel alive?



Yea, this is where I show you how nice I am. 50 bars

I rip up the mic dirty, battle anybody who's worthy
The only player out with a CT jersey
You see me, heard me, felt me, purely
The sickest on the earth, ain't no shit to cure me
I am surely, a rhyme busta, fuck ya
If you go against the kid then I'll have to crush ya
Knock you down like a gust of wind if fists touch ya
Cause I always stay on my grind like Chad Muska
Take that suckas, hit em with brass knucks
And kick em with Tims on and fuck that ass up
I eat em like Pac Man, the score just adds up
Should be in a trash can, shit I'm grouchy as fuck, yup
I'll wrap my hands around your neck and choke ya
Shock ten thousand volts, Zeus lightnin' bolt ya
So keep your courage close if I go and approach ya
Cause I'm here to "Face Off" like Nick Cage and Travolta
Spit molten flows that shatter your chest
Leave you with a broken nose for a lack of respect
So please son, if you really wanna battle the best
I'll put your fuckin' life in "Jeopardy" like Alex Trebek, yes
I'm not your average vet, blastin' a TEC
I'll ravage your set, beat you up like masochist sex
I never met another rapper of my caliber yet
But them beatin' me is like me passin' an Algebra test
I be flippin' like a calender, lyrics be scorchin' em
Rap valedictorian, swingin', stingin' like scorpions
Skin whiter than porcelain, but bringin' them dark forces in
Sick like the shit they caught on the Trail to Oregon
I'm talkin' Cholera, Scarlet Fever, and Dysentery
It's scary, you'd swear to god I memorized the dictionary
I'm buyin' if the "Price is Right" with Drew Carey
Fairly out of my mind got you runnin' like Tom and Jerry
I am very mentally nuts, spit with quickness
Step to a bitch like baseball, designated to hit this
Got your head spinnin' like kickflips, when I rip this
Hardbody like my flows lift weights at Planet Fitness
You can't get with this shit Chris spit I'm this sick hit piff
Till I'm flyin' through the air quick as a discus
You simply can't dismiss this, ready to go the distance
In the booth feelin' like a fuckin' kid on Christmas
This is, me back and fresh as can be
Hell I got more kicks than the UFC
More kicks than Jet Li, or Tekken 3
I'm nice, anybody I've ever met could agree
Could it be? The dude who's droppin' analogies
Hustlin' to make a salary, and burnin' opponents quick as a calorie
I will glad-a-ly, charge up the battery
And swing with a bat and see if I can knock your ass straight out the galaxy
Fact not fallacy, I rapidly drop shit
Pilot in the cock pit and sure as a clock ticks
I'll be here throwin' more fists than a mosh pit
50 bars later and I'm still spittin' hot shit

Yea bitch, I'm nice!



Yeah, put your bottles of Adderall in the air
This to everybody with A.D.D
You know you got it, ha, listen, listen

[Verse 1]
I got Attention Deficit Disorder, I ain’t kiddin' em'
Don’t know where I’d be without the Adderall and Ritalin
Poppin’ them shits three at a time in heavy dosages
And go back to the doctor like, I still can’t focus bitch
That’s right, It’s the A.D.D
Got officially tested in upstate CT
And after I did my part
The dude went to my parents and was like
Hmm, where do I start
His levels are off the charts
This shit is killin’ me, but still I rap it skillfully
Even with a certified mental disability
I know ya'll feelin’ me, it’s drivin' me mad
Got A.D.D so bad, I can’t even add

[Hook]
I can’t pay attention to nothing, end of discussion
I just got that A.D.D, A.D.D, A.D.D
I just got that A.D.D
And teacher I know that I can’t focus
Whatcha gotta know it’s just that A.D.D
A.D.D, A.D.D, I just got that A.D.D

[Verse 2]
I day dream more than Lupe, sing a different tune
Space out, eye fuckin' that biddy across the room
It’s true I’m not messin', this shit would get you stressin’
Teachers callin’ on me I’m like, uh, could you repeat the question
I don’t pay attention, I miss out on every lesson
Get lost cause I wasn’t listenin' when I got the directions
Start typing in my phone, and then forget who I was textin'
Zone out during sex and lose my fuckin' erection
I really hate this, constantly misplace shit
Losin' my wallet, phone, or keys, on a day to day basis
It’d probably help If every night I didn’t get wasted
And high enough to be a passenger aboard a space ship
But since I do, then fuck it
Even though losing my scholarship is not within my budget
Cause son I’m not playin’
I, uh, shit, I forgot what I was sayin’

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My brain just doesn’t work cause of all the drugs I’ve done
Plus the A.D.D. to the point that thinkin' even hurts
Teachers try to talk to me as if I am gonna hear it
All I do is crack jokes, space out, and write lyrics
My brain’s unraveled over time like a rope does
Lost my mind like the change in your sofas
But I don’t gotta take my meds to spit it dope cause
All they do is give me dry mouth and a coke buzz
So what? I can’t focus but it’s straight
At least I got a good excuse when all of my work is late
Maybe can’t pay attention, but there is still a place
In my brain that allows me to murder a mixtape
Wait, maybe it ain’t even so bad after all
Fuck all the doctors, I don’t need to pop an Adderall
I’ll just be a rapper and such to make bucks
But if that doesn’t work, uhh, I guess I’m fucked

[Hook]



[Hook- Miss Daja]
They say, They say this life is gonna chew you up and spit you right back out

But this games all I know about and I know it ain't fair

But I’m almost there, I know I’m almost there

[Verse 1- Chris Webby]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I’m feeling stuck really what the fuck, I kill it with the lyrics while I struggle for a buck
I’m frustrated, feelin like I shoulda just made it
Making money off of shows but can't even make a payment on a new whip
On the edge I’m really bout to lose it
But the fans keep me motivated I know I can do this
It’s funny, seems like everybody focusing on the lyrical content but I’m barely seeing any money
I’ll leave your nose runny cause I’m so sick yo
Still scrapin together quarters to get bogies down to sicko
I know this life has more in store for me, and if it don't then I'll put a pistol to my temple with nobody forcing me
It’s costing me blood,sweat, and tears and I hate the shit
I love the game this ain't just tryin' to make me rich
I love you hip-hop simple as that
But how much would it hurt to show a little love back

[Hook]

[Verse 2- Chris Webby]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I been chilling in the basement underground
They in the master bedroom throwin bucks around
Trynna be original every time I drop a rap
But all these labels lookin for another copy cat
Anyone say I’m bitin' Asher or Sam Adams swagger is gettin' knocked out if I catch yas
It's bullshit I've been doing this my whole life
And you say I’m jockin him just because were both white
They say "he's good" but he's no Slim Shady
Well how come every black rapper ain't compared to Jay-Z
I never said I was better than Em-kid
In my humble opinion Marshall's the best that's ever lived
I’m trynna do me and create my own lane
And though the haters gossip at least they’re sayin my name
And if I don't make it then life ain't fair but uh at least I know I was almost there

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Chris Webby]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So many damn shows I’m basically on tour
So fuck these labels if they ain't knockin at my door
My grass roots fan base is bigger than these dudes that are signin
This is crazy am I losin my mind
Dropped five mixtapes in a year and a half
No Pop-Tart shit
You hear that it's rap
And here are the facts
I grind harder than most of these dudes do
Always got new shit posted on YouTube
Shout to Khalifa cause me and him are supplying the most free music to your speakers
And if you ain't likin it shut your mouth bite your lip
I can't be stopped there's too much fuckin fightin Chris
This is history pen and hand writin this
Poseidon with the flow
King Triton bitch
So close I can taste it
I'll make it
Haters smoke a blunt by yourself and just face it

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Let me set it off cause it's going down
Now I said it, killing beats so producers look around for a medic
I'm the reason Casey Anthony got off without a sentence (I did it)
Plus I'm the reason Snooki got pregnant
Hustle these others cause these fuckers are under my league
They just mad that everyone this summer is bumpin' to me
Jugular punch I'm just like the WWE
Pulling off the rubber and I'll come in your mother for free
Shout to the Workaholics cause I'm a wizard
Drinking liquor till I got my fucking head in a pisser
Puking up my chicken dinner and a piece of my liver
And without brushing my teeth I'm making out with your sister, huh
Cause Webby don't brawl or fight fair
That's why they're falling off like Walter White's hair
Haunt your nightmares I'm givin them cold sweats
I'm at it again, now let the story progress!

[Hook]
See, Webby in the booth then I'm at it again
All I need it's a fucking pad and a pen
I said I'm at it again
Everybody go ahead of your friends
And let the mutant ninja rapper begin
Said I'm at it again
Super villain coming back at the end
I'm on top now, I'm laughing at them
I said I'm at it again
I'm at it again, I'm at it again
I'm at it again, again, again

[Verse 2]
You see, I'm running for title
They running for class president
Burn every last remnant, up in the lab getting in
Pick up the pad, letter it, don't need no swag etiquette
Connecticut, get ready and never give my rap sedative
Foul mouth, mother fucker, better learn to deal with it
Banging Tilla Tequila, then blow a load on Mila's tits
Pull up to your grandmother's house and I make her feel my dick
Milf hunter bitch, I'm as sick as they get
I'll be sipping on my bottle, in a room at the Ritz
With a cougar and shit, holding up a doobie and piff
I don't need no blood test just to prove that I'm sick
I'm fucking loony see me howling at a lunar eclipse
Wolfman like Del Torro, body bigger than Goro
Finish me? My combat styles are mortal
Always rolling deep, bitch better bring a snorkel
Hungry for the money, and I gotta have a fork-full

[Hook]



[Intro]
Yeeeeaaah, Webby

[Hook]
I've been going hard, all these years been on the low
Used to show up to the spot and they would stop me at the door
Now my name is hot so they be acting like they know
And they leading my right through those velvet ropes
Now I got them saying, aww naww, who the hell let Webby in
Aww naww, who the hell let Webby in
Aww naww, so run and tell your friends
It's time to get it started mother fucker, let the games begin

[Verse 1]
Oh hello, hi there, back in the ring, never fight fair
I swear, shades on tint, never seeing through my eye-wear
No button down but I'm sleeved up, so many shows and I fly there
And my fans be getting them tickets quicker than pissing in public in Times Square
That nightmare on your street, stay with the hash like corned beef
And I light it up and I breathe it and my blunt be full of that four leaf
We killing this and I'm on my grind, running shit I got sore feet
24 deep on my tour bus, rolling right out to the floor seats
I'm blowing up what are you doing, sitting at home and YouTubing
Hating on me from a laptop, but these type of people I'm used to em
You ain't doing shit but smoking weed, watching porn, got no degree
You're a disappointment and blame everybody else that you never got where you hoped to be
See I worked for it, you sat back, I grinded out while you relaxed
And now you like; "Fuck Webby man, yo, I should be where he's at, wait is that him, did he just cut the line, wait where's Denise at?"
But I ain't gotta say nothing back, cause I got your girlfriend on my lap

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Somebody turn my mic on, throw in that beat I could ride on
Shut up and listen cause fuck it I'm spitting so cold blooded, python
Connecticut over to Saigon, looking at me as if I am an icon
Getting that dough like I started with Tae-Kwon
Drinking this gin they be calling me Qui-Gon
Started out in that small time, mixtapes in the trunk of the car that I was driving in
That Altima, with back bumper hanging off the side, people honking at me (get off the road!)
Getting pulled over so often I'd have my registration at all times, hanging out my window like
Sorry guy, I know I was speeding, I'm fucking high, but my plates are good and I'm fucking dry
Smoked all my weed on my way down here, we ain't got no charges? Fuck you, bye
Peel off in that shit box, so kick rocks, I'm out of here
Then head back to my parents house and get drunk until I run out of beer
But that was then, now I'm living differently
The clubs that would always turn me away, now they all let me in for free
The girls that used to blow me off, now they all on their friggin' knees
Still blowing me off, only difference? Now it's literally

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Axe murder a beat the way I spit a free
Lizzie Borden in the flesh come and get at me
Like the witch of the west, I roll wickedly
Can’t see me like Paranormal Activity
Lickidy split, I rip shit quick-ily
Get ya camcorder out, bitch just picture me
Killin’ shit everyday till you get sick of me
Cause I been a beast, since the priest christened me
Blowin’ up ya tape deck, C.T. to Great Neck
Dutch full of O.G. Kush and some Train Wreck
Safe sex? nah, I’m too raw
I stick it in they jaws and I get ‘em out they drawers
I’m a boss and break laws but never take a loss
Flyer than macaws, I’m just doin’ it because
I’m the best to do this within my age bracket
Waka Flocka, Soulja Boy: none of ‘em can match it
That’s it, jot it down, print it up and fax it
And tell all your boys how Webby spit the madness
Got pussy goin' nuts like I got some catnip
More than a tad sick, I murder ‘em for practice
Do what I do when I…BURN
Then ya gonna Puff Puff Pass, it’s my…..TURN
I throw down with titans, I’m rhymin’ more
More bars than a phone in a Verizon store
Bitch, I’m bigger than a body of a dinosaur
I’m crazy, who would ever blow a line before
Goin’ into a math test, energetic as ever
And all I wrote down was my name, it’s "Chris Webster"
Too drugged up to pay attention in class
So I got kicked out and put my focus on rap
But don’t do like I do, cause I’m fucked in the head
All these un-prescribed meds, now I need special ed
I’m a beast, I’m a dog, I’m a mothafuckin’ pot head
Nerf Gun in my hand, step and you’ll be shot dead
Still mothafuckin’ crazy, don’t doubt me
Pocket full of lint, pack of bogies and my house keys
Aw, jeeze, I be burnin’ the palm trees
Keystone Light to your fuckin’ Dom P
Lazy kid, I still live with my mom, see
Smokin’ bud sleepin’ late, playin’ Nazi Zombies
28 days later, see me in the paper
I’m a mix of Stewie Griffin with a little Darth Vader
Leave a crater in the earth when I drop my mixtape
The north star ain’t this hot for shit’s sake
Chase a 40 o.z. with a box of fish flakes
They might forget my name but they’ll remember how my dick taste
Dictate the scene at all times
Cause the ninja rapper’s back with an Optimus Rhyme
You Underclassmen can’t see The White Noise, bitch
That’s why my mixtape’s bumpin’ in ya boy’s whip
Oh shit, I spit and wreak havoc
My vocal chords like twin Glocks, let me blast it
Cause if anybody steps then I’ma bury ‘em
C.T.’s on my back and I’ma carry ‘em
Smoke blunts till my IQ’s very dumb
Stay high like the water bill at an aquarium



[Verse 1]
I'm the Hip-Hop antichrist, they'll regret it if they hand me mics
Jack The Ripper, huntin' bitches down by candle light
Changing the standard of nice, brandish a knife
I'm what's crackin' like I'm tightenin' ya hand in a vice
Huh! My flow nasty, get a Tampax
So many bars you would think I was flippin' Xanax
Fuck caterin' the bitches when I spit yo
Go and listen to Drizzy you dumb bimbo
This is real rappin' Webby flow it with a passion
Get these letters in my brain and cause a chemical reaction
Droppin' vowels and consonants, powerfully rockin' it
With enough force to level a continent
What I'm droppin' is the right way, I got em' guessin' what I might say
Go bananas like Johnny Drama and Andrew Dice Clay
Since the 9th grade Webby's been a psychopath
Headphones on in detention when I was writin' raps
Queue the lightnin' crash, queue the smoke machines
A factor you should fear, even Joe Rogan screams
Dopamine and adrenaline till' I'm hemorrhagin'
The fuckin' villain's back in this bitch, you better remember him

[Hook]
Say good night to the bad guy
No fuckin' around, don't got to ask why
I'll be here until they bury me and thats why
They know to run when they see me
I'm the motherfucka haunting your dreams
I'm the motherfuckin' bad guy
No fuckin' around, don't got to ask why
I'll be here until they bury me and thats why
They no to run when they see me
I'm they motherfucka haunting your dreams

[Verse 2]
You can catch me where the wild things be at
Hit em' so quick they can't react, even an Atheist would believe that
Fuck shootin' guns, I fire cannon balls
With the physical strength of a Neanderthal
Roar! I'm a Tyrannosaurus Rex
Start by beatin' up the verses and I'll slam the chorus next
Got a standard for success and for me it's bein' the best
The games like a bench presser, let me get it off my chest
I'm a vet, but I ain't checkin' on the healthiness of any K-9s
I'm giving you the news bitch, NBC dateline
Hear me through the grapevine, murderin' tracks
Leave you layin' in the bed where they do surgeries at
I been the hottest dude under the sun
Beatin' me? You got a better chance fuckin' a nun
Fuck it I'm done, got my competition on the run
Won't be happy till' I'm number one, deadly with the tongue
Rap bandito doing' coke by the kilo
The mad super villain is back, Magneto
So bow down to me or get eaten like sushi
So fuck you and have a great day, Yours truly

[Hook]



[Intro]
Yeah...Webby
I drop 50 bars, mad bars, raised the bar twice
The bars are on me all night
If they wanna go bar for bar we can do it on sight
I'm a beast, you're gonna never see me lose a bar fight

[Verse 1]
Everyone got an opinion but they won't step up
Can do a fucking handstand still got no leg up
So go ahead, talk your shit, yo, come on get tough
I'll Instagram a dick pic, you could all get fucked
I'm still as sick as a malaria patient, I'm very impatient
Stomping up the stairs of the basement (I'm coming)
No hibernation, yo, this bear is awakened
And half the game be softer than what Ben and Jerry are making
I'm a transcendentalist with literary arrangements
Vocabulary is like a dictionary replacement
But they only talking money and they last time I was checking
The greater percentage of America is in a recession (hold up) (what)
So what you're sayin' is these diamond crusted necklaces
And convoluted messages is really what you're messing with
Where's the dope shit what happened to that
Back when people stepped up to the mic and actually rapped
But now I'm on it, been here for a minute, and now I'm back to get them
Had this devil on my shoulder during catechism
Staying high from the purple and the hash I'm hitting
Brain moving slower than Rick Ross' metabolism
I'm here to rap a rhythm, so why you saying shit (why)
So many fucking punch lines, I'm about to break my wrist
Undefeated, yo, I'm hard to be playing with
I'm the king, alter alias is Marcus Aurelius
Killing beats, murder scene, and I'm washing my hands carefully
Scrubbing all the blood out the trunk of the Grand Cherokee
In need of therapy but the doctor's scared of me
Says I need a trip to Shutter Island cuz apparently
I've lost my damn mind,yo, I'm sick in the head
The reason women say that chivalry's dead
I'm that guy, trying to find some company laying in misery's bed
Staying blunted with a fifth to the head
Judge Dredd with a weapon now, laser beam flow bout to blast that
Mother fucking lyricist, you can hashtag that
Freestyle crazy, they like; "Yo, how he rap that?"
So hot off the top, I'll melt the plastic in my snapback
In a hatchback running people over till your body parts are stuck in my motor
Never sober, I got to charge my G-Pen like 12 times every weekend
Sharks and minnows with it always treading in the deep end, shit who needs friends
I got my headphones, an iPod, rhyme book and a pen, homes
Shit, I even got bars in a dead zone
I get it crackin' like chiropractors with neck bones
Shit, I been slept on, way too fucking long now
Studied every fork in the road taking the long route (yes sir)
Mapped it out like cartography, build my bridges strong
And now I know that anyone that stomps at me will tremble in my hands
Run them off my lands, see I always stuck it to the man
Fuck it, cuz I can, bringing out the ruckus is my plan
Puffing on a gram, if you want some trouble I'm your man
Comfortably stand right where I'm at
Soon to be legend, ain't no fighting the facts
About to rise to be a mother fucking titan of rap
Give them pieces of my soul and put my life in a track
In the game where people quick to put that knife in your back
Gotta teach yourself to move like a wolf or get preyed on
Fuck blowing up the real challenge is to stay on
You must be fucking stupid if you take on
This crazy white boy, keep my game face on
And my shades on, and my brim low, and my mind right
Cooking up a sick flow, chewing through my leash, now see the kid go
Because now we here bitch, welcome to the show



[Verse 1]
Yea I'm back up in this bitch just like a uterus
And I don't need no lubricated condom when I'm doing this
Always got a doobie lit
Swerve behind the wheel and maneuver it
Twenty-twenty with it, use my eyes to see the future quick
Moving shit, I'm just trying to be what I'm supposed to be
Supposedly I'm dope, St. Nicholas ain't as cold as me
The thing we got in common is I'm always with a Ho or three
Make them drop it like someone with Parkinson's carrying groceries
Cause I'm here and I rap that shit, doing shows and stacking chips
Take my shirt off when I spit that's why your girl is on my dick
Got these tats all on my body and a pocket full of piff
Fill the bong up with some ice cubes, baby take a hit
See I'm running for the title, everybody voting Webster
Drinking straight tequila out a mother fucking blender
Middle finger stay up, nobody can censor
I'm a dog always sniffing for the female gender
Friend her up on facebook and from there it's a wrap
Send a poke and then tomorrow she'll be sitting on my lap
Even back when I was broke, my girlies always had a rack
Love them big titty bitches with bodies covered in tats
It's that marijuana twister, grabbing ladies from the mixer
Then I bring them to the telly, and crack a bottle of liquor
Cause I never gave a fuck, I'm the type to bang your sister
Then go back to your crib and fuck your moms like Stiffler
I hope you get the picture, take it on your Kodak
Up in Webby's World you cannot reach me with a road map
To find it you need Adderall, Ambien, and some Prozac
Always cooking fire, someone show me where the stoves at
Keep on dropping heat, all you players grab your cleats
Cause I'm in this game to win it, I won't settle for defeat
From the suburbs to the streets, I will stand by what I speak
And I don't even know what this bitch is saying up on the beat
But I got a hundred bars on me
Everything that we throw on the credit card's on me
Every drink that we get at the titty bar's on me
And I'll be living just like this until my heart don't beat
Bitches it's Chris Webby, that whitey who spit deadly
With my foot up on the pedal like I'm Mario Andretti
Fucker I rap flames and murder the rap game
Spitting 'til I'm number one with a bullet like Max Payne
Got that Nerf gun tucked and I'll aim it at your gut
Better duck, it's that cracker and slapper of big butts
Getting drunk, always looking for some double D cups
But in the lab I cook it up like I'm WolfGang Puck
Get up in the game and I go straight ham
When I get the rock up in my hand
Cause I'm here to get it popping just exactly how I planned
Take a stand right here for this rapping shit
And keep my lyrics accurate
Test me but beating Webby just simply will never happen bitch
Salute me cause truly I be the dopest on the chords
Master Yoda with the bars, I'm a Jedi with the force
That's cause Webby done got that flow
They can act like they don't know
But they ain't fucking with me period yo
Finito



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm rollin' safe and sound, easy as I blaze a pound
Put my middle fingers in the air and never take it down
Writin' raps for me is easy, I just play around
Hit em' with these crazy adverbs and outrageous nouns
And still no labels found me and fuckin' signed me yet
And though I grow impatient, I know my time is next
I'm a big dog, y'all are tiny pets
I'm an autobot, I got it tatted on my chest
Optimus Primes my mothafuckin' bodyguard
So I hit em' with these you can never stop me bars
I'm at the sake bar, gettin' blacked out
Till I wake up on the sidewalk passed out
The judge is tellin' me this is my last chance
So I gotta stay grindin' like a lap dance
Got bitches bendin' over like they had a back cramp
Insert below the lower back tat, damn
I'm why your girlfriend lacks pants
Huh, steady work her out like it's fat camp
Uh, yo, somebody grab a trash can
Shit, at least somewhere to ash man
I gotta dutch lit, rappin' with soul
Leave you with a fat lip like you're packin' some Skoal
Cause I do it for the Franklins
I'm a blue whale and the games full of plankton
I'm a vet, a top threat, known to rock sets
Tear it the fuck down for DJ Booth.net
So yes, I'm ballin' truly so y'all should shoot me
You can see me on that online Call of Duty
Smack booty, I'm rude and intrusive, hardly lucid
Hittin' DJ Booth with that exclusive
I need no excuses, I spit that crack
Play fetch with the disc jockey bring that shit back
They said Asher's the best in the burbs, well at least that's what they said
And that's for one reason, cause they ain't heard Web
I make a mean song, plus I kick it from the head
Always buzzin off the A.D.D. meds, Hempstead!
To CT you know I make the best stutter
No Will Ferrel, but you better step, brother
Ha, that's why your girl's ass bare
I hit it, and didn't pay for the cab fare
Now relax there, don't get pissed off
I'm the survivor on my island, and you been kicked off
Think this kid's soft? R.O.F.L
I got the look, got the swag, and a flow that sells
My reputation so excels so just stop
I do more then watch for sex, drugs, and rock
I'm silly and such, fillin' a dutch
Battlin' dudes who simply suck
Then go fuck Hillary Duff
Tryin to rap it with my dick in the butt
And spit fire, so I'm sorry Lizzie McGuire
See, I'm rappin' past the throttle, I'll crack a bottle
So you better get the fuckin picture like a graphic novel
I got your little bastard boggled
You couldn't fuck with me even if we spittin' at a brothel
Cause I be killin' em like Hostile, murderous with words
That's why they sayin' Webby is the best up in the burbs



[Intro]
Yeah, Webby, Freeway, yeah!
Block to the Burbs, man
If you nice, you nice, end of story

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You see I'm reppin' for the burbs, still I'm murderin' verses
With Connecticut inserted in ink on my epidermis
Written in my skin layer, with rhymin', I've been greater
Writin' lyrics on a piece of paper since a sixth grader
With my CD disc player, playin' loud up in the Sony phones
With a style of the flowin' that I call my own
CT's what I call my home and I'm never leavin' you
Put us on the map is what I need to do
And even through the hate and the criticism I take it and listen
But all you fakers are breakin' the way I rape 'em with lyricism
I stay with the clearest rhythm, regardless of burb spot
Burbs to the blocks if you spittin' a verse hot
And that's all that matters, you either got it or not
Regardless of where you grew up at with your mom and your pops
See, I'm in it to the finish, never plottin' to stop
Rhymin' heat, pilot seat, kamikaze the spot
Think you dope? Well you're probably not
I could body the block with nothin' but a sixteen on the top
I'm like Tony Soprano when I rip it I bust flow in a suburban commando
And I'm bigger than Hulk Hogan
Check it I'm wreckin' every consecutive second
In from Philly back to the 2-03 that's what we representin'
I've been destined to make it, and I won't stop 'til I get it
And now it's Freezer and Webby, two different worlds are connected

[Hook: Chris Webby & (Freeway)]
Ride to the 'burbs, take a trip with me
We gon' cruise all around the world
(Man, they hatin' when we visit, come around they girls)
(Visit burbs, visit ghettos all around the world)
From the burbs to the block take a trip with me
We gon' cruise all around the world
(When we visit try to keep us from around your girls)
(Visit burbs, visit ghettos all around the world)

[Verse 2: Freeway]
911 it's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From the hood to the burbs, every one of you people heard of Free-
Way, and for y'all that ain't heard of me
House old one in '06, no burglary
Survived the Roc split, continued to drop hits
These rappers continue to bite my shit, commit perjury
Outer space bars, Freezer still spit mercury
Flow is from outta this planet, women from Venus
Men are from whatever planet, they think with they penis
E.T. bars, spacemen look for me when they land it
Never panic, hit up Webby tell him, "Ready to canvas"
Globetrotter, I'm in Africa, be back by the evenin'
Don't sweat it, I will be there on behalf of the Beamer
Plus the Delta Sky team while I insist that I'm reppin'
When I fly that's who I fly with, I'm a diamond member
Any weather, ? I can get up on a jet and jet it?
Back home they call me Chester, cause I get the cheddar
Yeah I get to the green, I got my shit together
It's a national hustler, I still ? rocks in the united states
Still bobblin' mecca, from the burbs to the ghetto
Word to the wise, never lie in your rap songs, learn from Geppetto
Pinnocchio, tell lies and your nose grow
Me and Webby ride, get cheddy 'til we old folks

[Hook]

[Outro]
From the Burbs to the Block
Burbs to the ghetto



[Intro:]
Yeah, y'know you think this is all there is to life sometimes
You grind so hard, huh, you forget, but I guess I'm moving onto bluer skies
Right

[Hook:]
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
I'm moving on to bluer skies

[Verse 1:]
You see the life I used to live I don't know anymore
I'm a step away from not being broke anymore
I'mma grind so hard I don't even have a life
Used to have fun every night now I just write
In the booth, press record and I let my soul bleed
For these listeners like you, to critique, so you see
It's all I ever wanted, could've sworn that it was true
But sometimes I wonder if I do
Sessions in the studio goin' on till seven in the morning
Got me wondering if it's blue skies or storming
No time to kick it with the homies and all that
I'm sorry, I'm so busy, yo, I meant to call back
The people I grew up with, chilled and smoked blunts with
Now I got it back to the end, trust it
When I see you again, we'll roll up a dub
And go back to the way we was, it's all love

[Hook:]
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
I'm moving on to bluer skies

[Verse 2:]
Staying up 'til the sunrise with my mind racing
Thinking to myself is this a dream worth chasing
Lost contact with friends 'cos of the grind
It's not that I don't got love, just no time
Mom and Dad, yo, I can't thank you enough
I know the past months have been rough, thanks for putting up
But your renegade son conduct disorderly
But no matter what I was doing you still supported me
Sorry that I don't call you as much as I should
But your boy is on the grind, non-stop, doing good
(It grooves down to D-Block and Dame Dash felt me)?
I know I'm doing something special, you ain't got to tell me
Following that bright light to fortune and fame
Sacrificing all I got to immortalize my name
Every single day I gotta put up a fight
But this the life that I asked for, right?

[Hook:]
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
I'm moving on to bluer skies

[Outro:]
Keeping moving on
Gotta keep on moving on



[Freestyle]
It’s Chris Webby, getting high as fuck right now
I’m hella sick, and no one knows what I’m infected with
So hi it’s nice to meet you
I’m the guy your girl been texting with
Evil rap nemesis, lighting up that heady shit
That’s potent as the poison in a fucking box jellyfish
In a box Chevy with the soldiers in my fellowship
Legolas and Aragorn cruising through Connecticut
Leave behind a trail of empty bottles and jealous chicks
Throw around bread, I’m on my Hansel and Gretel shit
A psychopath on a path of destruction
Popping Xanax til I’m seeing black
I better pass the Dutch Master I’m puffing
The first up the the mic but the last to the function
Stumbling drunk with a busty chick with a passion for sucking
East Coast, we don’t borrow your swagger for nothing
We’d rather start a battle instead of having a discussion
So pass it back to me, cousin
Shit I’m so nice I could spit this shit right here backwards in Russian!

No sound like the one I got
They can hear it anytime I rock
Cause all I got’s my balls and my word
And this baggie full of herb
And I’m coming for that #1 spot

I’ve always been a loose cannon
They say I rolled off of a pirate ship
High as shit, Bobby Costas, look how red my eyes’ll get
I’m out in Sochi, 720 to a flying split
And land all up in that vagina bitch, huh
See I be showing them what I can do with this shit
Yo what you think I was new to this shit?
Got a beautiful chick in the passenger seat
Giving head to me while I maneuver the whip
Vroom, rhyme book staying fucking full
Chemically Imbalanced, and fully fucking disfunctional



[Hook]
Yeaaah, all you motherfuckers
Turn it up let it (bounce)
In the trunk let it (bounce)
Throw em up let it (bounce)
Yeah bitch, this is what we do when we verbally turn em out
With the speakers to the maximum, baby just let it bounce
Now, in a crowd let it, (bounce) turn it loud let it (bounce)
Blow em out let it (bounce)
Yeah bitch, this is what we do when I show em what I'm about
With the speakers to the maximum baby just let it bounce

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
It's that evil rap nemesis, puttin' together sentences
Faster than that hedgehog runnin' on Sega Genesis
Higher than the hooves of Pegasus, and let the pencil hit
The paper harder than a bus, Jerome Bettis it
Let it be said a bit with the excellent rhetoric
My vernacular's spectacular, step to me and I'll settle it
If mastery of language was the goal, then I'm ahead of it
You can't connect the checks that I'm cuttin' down in Connecticut
My flow is art, rib cage, got a soldier's heart
Verbally a double barrell shotty, leave you blown apart
I'm such an animal they kicked me off of Noah's Ark
Cause they keep on comin' up shorter than Napoleon Bonaparte
Me? I'm a tall dude, never let you fall through
Hard as granite dammit, these bitches softer than dog food
Shoot em up, R2, drop so many bars you
Haters quit your job, cause there's nothin' to argue
Now let it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
White boy rap sergeant, buzz bigger than Cartman
Mentally a menace, my brain's the size of a Martian's
Used to be broke as fuck at the mall lookin' for bargains
Now I got a gold card, cha ching, charge em'
Started off small now I do it for the masses
Spit it greater, incinerate em, burn em to ashes
Now these new college kids think that they can match it
Bitch I drop classics, all you droppin' is classes
Who needs Hofstra? Hip-Hops my donna school
Hotter than my mamas macaroni with some gaba gruel
Yeah I'm cocky as fuck, just bein' honest fool
Being modest isn't in a single molecule
In my whole body, who's touchin' me nobody
Now I'm up on iTunes takin' yo money
Give a shit my nose runny cause I spit it so sick
Now bounce turn it up in the whip, cause you know we gonna

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I'm that dude with a 40 while everybody sippin' Rozay
No filter on my mouth, not a thing I won't say
Check the clocks like Coldplay, know what time it is
And my future still looking good like Marisa Tomei
Huh, beatin' me? no way, bitch you better ease up
Who needs a label? only thing I'm signin' is a prenup
I'm a beast why would I compete with these chumps
I'm an 8 ball, they only equal the key bump
Keep my bars hot, rappin' in the car lots
Private school trainin' at the school of hard knocks
They pop the hard rock, I'm makin' your jaw drop
So high, I'm up in the sky with Star Fox
Hip-Hop veteran, rockin' a Whalers letterman
Bad to the bone you can check my damn skeleton
Webby ready as ever you better let me in
Come on bounce let me tell em' again
So just

[Hook]



Yea
I'm Bowser bitch
Let me blow some fireballs on these motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Call me Bowser, hit em on a flow like a boss, bitch
It's inevitable that you steppin' on my level
In the end your gunna end up leavin' with a loss, bitch
Line in the sand, I crossed it, grindin' till I'm exhausted
Never gonna put the mic down
I'm here right now so what you want bitch
Still here cause I flow rhymes, mixtape shit since, '09
Only white dude in the game who made it this far without a cosign
Baby and now it's showtime, they tellin' me that it's your time
Freestylin' my destiny, bitches, I never wrote mine
So learn my fuckin' name, just know we not the fuckin' same
I'm fightin' for my life and the title just like the Hunger Games
Have to gather my success, that Connecticut, rough neck
Any time a beat gets killed they lookin' for me
Cause they know I'm the suspect
Leavin' competition upset, grabbin' that girl, then we fuck, yes
They steppin' to me in a battle and winnin?
That's like me passin' a drug test
Shit will not happen, ready for action
Gabbin' the mic and I'm gettin' it crackin'
No need for the braggin'
I know that I'm dope and homie you ain't even a fraction
But what I could do, I'm comin' for you and steadily killin' the rappin'
So fuck it I'm through, I'm pummelin' crews and leavin' the cypher laughin'
Takin' bottles to the face till I'm like fuck man
So dirty my entourage follows behind me with dust pans
So slow it down some, sippin' on my Styrofoam
Trapped inside of Webby's world like Pauly Shore in Bio-Dome
I roll an 8th of fire just so it can take me higher
Molten lava flowin', smokin' my volcano vaporizer
I haven't made it yet cause rap is full of politics
So all you politicians suck my dick until you swallow it
My dreams must have a twitter account, cause I'm a follow it
And anyone or anything in my way I'll demolish it
Mothafuckin' monster steadily rippin' it proper
Bitches so get to the chopper
Mean as Baraka, speakin' it lava
Breaking it badder than Tuco Salamanca
Killer with flow, bouncin' around like I'm Tigger on blow
Spittin' it so, outta control, trippin' the dough
The slower you thinkin', the quicker I go
The pick of the litter with vigorous flow
Keep the bitches titties jigglin' yo'
I stick and I go, I'm better than you
No matter how you try to figure it bro
The villain is back, killin' a track
Won't stop till I got me a million in cash
Listen to facts, R2 trigger attack, drop that magnificent rap
Giggity, giggity, giggity, splat, the illest up in the vicinity's map
Killin' theses bitches like Trinity's back, with different rhythm so listen to that
So Mario should do his cardio and grab a flower
Cause you'll need to throw some fire balls if you gon' step to Bowser



Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "Brass Tacks"
[Hook: Chris Webby]
Yeah, it's time to get down to brass tacks
Get it cooking baby show me where the lab's at
Here we go again, now see the cash stack
All these bills got my pockets saying Aflac
Yeah, it's time to get down to brass tacks
Bunch of women in my whip like I'm Mad Max
(Ass fat) tap it like I'm skipping through my Snapchats
You can't even do half that

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You see I've always been a killer with raps, it's that villainous cat
Go and tell em Jack the Ripper is back
And I'm making every syllable snap, a gorilla with the silverest back
Strength levels hitting simian stats
Loud pack until my eyes are cloudy
And I'm a monster with the ink, when I'm writing they call me Mike Wazowski
Am I dead? Cause I see those vultures flying found me
Tryna get a piece of what I have proudly designed around me
And like Rhonda Rousey I'm smacking bitches, and act malicious
In the laboratory I'm back to business..
I been the, best in the burbs since my third CD
Still I'm under rated like making The Purge PG
(They gone love me, trust me)
Started in the lab as a puppy now I'm a fully grown UCONN husky
Never rusty, so never rush me, don't ever touch me
Turned my skills into a job and now I'm getting money
My chick's skinny, my piff's sticky, my whip's pretty
I been busy, stirring up trouble in Sin City
You'll get killed really, here on the mic when I spit gritty
Eating rappers like I got the appetite of Chris Christie
I would listen to the radio, taping it on casette
So I could walk around my private school playin' it
And Eminem was my favourite, can't you tell?
When I grab this serrated blade and I stab myself in the face with it
Grab a grenade and placin' it in my pocket and pulled the pin
That's why the Darwin Awards is the only book I'm in
Hook 'em in, if these bitches single then my dick'l tingle
And you won't need the internet to witness Christian mingle
Yeah, cause I been shooting for the stars
I got, openin' telescope, an uzi in the car
And now they see me rippin' the stage, I started out on the bottom
Got to the middle, now I'm flippin' the page bitch

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Yeah, it's time to get down to brass tacks
Get it cooking baby show me where the lab's at
Here we go again, now see the cash stack
All these bills got my pockets saying Aflac
Yeah, it's time to get down to brass tacks
Bunch of women in my whip like I'm Mad Max
(Ass fat) tap it like I'm skipping through my Snapchats
You can't even do half that

Verse 2: [Danimal Lector]
Bout to get down to brass tacks, nothing I'm doin' is half ass
In the booth, 100 proof, getting loose ‘til the roofs goes poof… match that
A literal lab rat, syllables abstract
Dozen notebooks, no hooks, in my timberland back pack
Killin' shit mad fast, doing some fat dabs
On a Dyno with black mags, no time for cat naps
Mother fuckers wake up, or climb a ladder with Jacob
Name your top 10 rappers, I’ll eat 5 like some Steakums
The other 5, 50/50 whether I could take em
But I know I could hang with every name that they been sayin'
Amazing’s an understatement, I’m underground, under rated
Under paid, and underappreciated
But I wouldn’t mind bein' famous… hint, hint
Go buy my album bitches, fuck it get both of ‘em
My flows opium, double dose, mind openin''
Feeling like I’m floatin' in, a boiling pool of molten gin
Engulfed in sin, tryna stay positive more or less
But I know, every shot can’t touch the bottom of the net
So it’s on to the next, never wanting to rest
Dominant as Indominus Rex, call me God in the flesh
Gotta confess, I really got a lot on my chest
Treasure buried in my heart, somewhere I forgot how to get
I guess, that’s why I’m chewin' percs, cause see the truth can hurt
Music works, as my way to connect with the universe
It’s not how hard you can hit, but get hit
All the scars and shit make you who you are, news alert
Be proud own it, third eye open I’m usin' words
And sound waves to time travel through space to Jupiter
Feelin' like its 4th down, game on the line
Hail Mary, Mary please, I’m just waitin' to shine
I’m the diamond in the rough that you’ve been waitin' to find
So, what the fucks up? Stop wastin' my time

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Yeah, it's time to get down to brass tacks
Get it cooking baby show me where the lab's at
Here we go again, now see the cash stack
All these bills got my pockets saying Aflac
Yeah, it's time to get down to brass tacks
Bunch of women in my whip like I'm Mad Max
(Ass fat) tap it like I'm skipping through my Snapchats
You can't even do half that



[Intro]
This just in, Connecticut rapper Chris Webby Webster
Was finally caught by local authorities earlier this evening
He is reportedly being brought up on a number of
Assault and battery charges for the instrumentals that
He hospitalized early this year, he was found in
His parents attic where he lives. Haha! What a fuckin' loser!
More details to come, back to you with the weather Lisa

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm a beast on the mic when I speak, when I write
Speak to the sight, OZ in the pipe
I don't give a fuck if my jeans too tight
Don't worry bout me, go live your life
Just too nice, rock it ill, no auto tune, just lots of skill
Crazy so says Dr. Phil, roll one up and pop a pill
Do what I do when I rep for the 2 to the 0 to the 3, I got it dude
Never hold back with the words I spew, through my mouth aimed right at you
Through and through I'm that, you don't wanna try that
Can't see me like your own eyelash, snap on em' like a Venus Flytrap
I'm back, best in the burbs, kill the track with the excellent words
That I got in my brain, when I drop it insane, top of the game, live and learn
Always drop the hottest cause you know that Webby got it
Bein' dope isn't a question, it's a fuckin' pinky promise
I'm crazy, nothin' but straight jackets in my closet
Roofyin' myself with Zachary Galifianakis
Higher than a rocket orbitin' the rings of Jupiter
I'm the psychopathic illegitimate son of Lucifer

[Skit]
When brought in for questioning Webster was found to have
Eight bags of cocaine, 27 ecstasy pills
Three ounces of marijuana, 2 illegal pet tiger cubs
Four Ninja Turtle action figures
And a kidnapped Cambodian prostitute
His bail has been set at $2,000,000 dollars and he
Oh wait, this just in Chris Webby has escaped?!
Oh Jesus, oh god, lock your fuckin' doors people. Oh, fuck!

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Kill anything that I go and do
Come at me once and your dead, in the afterlife you'll be 0 and 2
It's fantasy to imagine me in a sober mood
Winnings what I chose to do, and I did and now It's game over dude
I'm the next white boy just to let you know
I grab a hold of the beat and I never let it go
That's why they buying a ticket to come to Webby's show
So grab a Tampax, I got a heavy flow
Do what I does, always buzzed, then say that I don't do drugs
Never been a day that I gave a fuck, so shut your mouth and tape it up
Rollin' in with vitamins, Vicodin, Liquid Nitrogen
So much fuckin' weed that I'll probably forget my lines again
Uhh, fuck, what was I gettin' at?
I've lost my mind, I'm surprised I still have my head attached
I get my razor in hand and you know I shred a track
So spread the mothafuckin' word bitch, Webby's back!



[Verse 1]
Pulling my fitted right down to my eyes, like a fucking disguise
Thought that I wanted it so I just shot for the sky
Now I don’t even know why
Gave it a try, wanted a piece of the pie, now it’s a fucking surprise
The way that I’m living is different
I’m hitting and missing, and I’m just here trying to vibe
Oh my god, all this shit done changed, people be noticing me
Now they all love me, or hate me
Like there ain’t no in between
I’m doing me, and that’s all I know
Out on the road doing these shows
To give you the fans a little piece of my soul
But you must know I’m just like you when I ain’t got no mic
So if you see me out in public show me respect and we aight
And yes you can have an autograph
But if I’m with a girl or my family and friends
I don’t get that much so please don’t ask
Pick and choose, you respect me as a person, I’ll reciprocate
Tip my hat and give you dap and I will just be on my way
If you see me while I’m out and got my hat down to my eyes
Brim low, that is like my “please do not disturb” sign

[Hook]
I’m just tryna live my life like I’m supposed to be
While I’m following the path that has chosen me
Now it’s everywhere I go people notice me
Feet planted with my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low, and I don’t see no haters
My eyes red, cause I’m always medicated
Now they say I made it, cause I’m elevated
But my feet planted and my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low, I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low with my head up high
And I’ma keep my brim low

[Verse 2]
Always be keeping my hat to my brow
And my head in the clouds
Shit has been stressing me so I been rolling this loud
Trying to block it all out
But I know right now that this here’s my shot
Shit or get off of the pot
Shoot for the top, ain’t no looking back
This is all I got, so I will not stop
But I sacrifice my private life
That’s the shit that drives a person nuts
But I won’t lose sight of that feeling I got way back when
When I started to write
Hit Radio Shack with my dad
Bought me a mic, best day of my life
Ever since then I just make this music
Put it out for them to hate
But I’m Superman, my skin too thick to be penetrated
So many people always been telling me that I never would make it
But I’m an artist, how many times must I demonstrate it?
Now it’s my time to take it, I made my choices
But now so many people in my ear I’m hearing voices
So if you see me while I’m out and got my hat down to my eyes
Brim low, that is like my “please do not disturb” sign

[Hook]



Yeah, ya know
It’s Chris Webby, uh (brim low)

[Hook: Smokahantas]
When we rollin’ in the whip after rollin’ up the piff
And we all gon’ get in free
Then I fill myself a cup, lean back with a dutch
Burn it down till it’s hard to see
I’ma keep my brim low low low low low low low low
And ain’t nobody gon’ be botherin’ me, no one botherin’ me
So I’ma keep my brim low

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I keep my brim low, nobody seein’ me
I got a dutch rolled full of the greenery
Hoppin’ out the scenery and spittin’ the best
So hot you’ll melt like the wicked witch of the west
Yes, and then we rollin’ up a fat one
Joint papers up in the wallet, I always have one
Keef on the bowl pack, we gettin’ high now
Brim low, pull the fitted to my eyebrows
Draggin’ on a dutchie, I’m in my own zone
O-Z of Sour D and that homegrown
I don’t fuck with no middies, just that headies
Twist it in a blizzy, now we gettin’ dizzy
Crack open a 40
Then roll yourself another we gon’ party till the mornin’
That’s how we get it goin’, Chris Webby
Number one supporter of that THC
My veins run green from all this weed
I’m so damn high I can barely even see
But I’m still burnin’, take another pull
Wash down an Adderall with a Red Bull
Now I got my energy and I’m still blasted
Marijuana makes life so fantastic
It is more than a habit, it is an addiction
Can’t imagine one day when I’m not twistin’
Brain moves slow, but I don’t care
Every blunt was worth it, nothin' else compares
Mary Jane you are my baby, I’ll take you as my lady
Until you take that last brain cell and I go crazy
Everything I been through, ain’t know what to do
My first resort was turnin' to you, and now I’m burnin’ with you
Go n’ roll them windows up, now puff puff pass that lovely dutch

[Hook]

Keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low (low low low low)
I’ma keep my brim low (low low low low)
I’ma keep my brim low (low low low low)
I’ma keep my brim low (low low low low low low low low)

[Hook]



Ye, ye, ye, ye, yea
Woo, let's go!

Come my lady, come come my lady
I am the MVP you can't trade me
Hate me or love me I spit greatly
Fuckin the track up, my town is crazy
I'll be back on the beat, back like the rear seat
Reclined and now I'm puttin up my feet
Heat is what I produce like rubbing flint
Punches gottcha seeing two like double mint
I'm just trying to cop a dub and split a dutch open
Fill it with that Mary Jane and start smokin'
Rollin' that shit up and get blasted
Smellin' so good in a bag it's orgasmic
Drop rhythms, pop pills till I'm trippin'
So high that my feet are lifting off the ground like a magician
Since I started flippin' I just never stopped spittin'
Now I am a brain surgeon on these pediatricians
Stay whippin', 2 blunts down and stay twistin'
Keep my people closer than the fingers in a mitten
Verbal ammunition and you know I'm never missin'
More fly than, Dancer, Cupid, Donnor and Blitzin
I am Christian, last name is Webster
Tear down the rap game,insane and clever
Buzzed off the cocaine, untamed as ever
Come down harder than rain, spit flames for pleasure
The X I got won't find you treasure
It'll leave you rollin so hard you'll leave in a stretcher
Better than all these clowns, shit I'm blastin off
I am the next, better Asher Roth
With an unheard flow I'm original
CT Criminal
Any opposition? Minimal
Get up in your face, not a message is subliminal
Battle with me simply is not winnable
I am the pinnacle of white raps since I started to write tracks
Blowing up knuckles and fight back
I like that, I might blast off to the moon
Smokin piff for a night
Capped off dogs, so light that
Puff puff pass till you fall on your ass
Quicker than silver and more fast than the flash
I'm a go kill em with my flow while they're ready to go
So bro, you know you can't rap with me
You're about as hard as a virgin daiquiri
Spit some shit, swear to God I was black, yah see
But I'm a white boy outta the academy
I master beats, who could spit it after me?
So if your looking for the best bitch ask for me
I'm a youngster the next rap from the rug
Like bow wow if he was white and on drugs
And if his tracks didn't suck but they does
So I'm a be a whole lot better than he was
I'm buzzed, you'll know that he's bad
Like Amy Winehouse before the rehab
Poppin' 3 tabs, I'm mad like (doc Jekyll)
Bump up the base line and you know I rock treble
Number one hip hop rebel
You know what I meant, illest MC of European descent



[Intro x2]
I’m going in for the kill
I’m doing it for a thrill
I’m hoping you’ll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I’m bulletproof fully equipped Kevlar skeleton
To slaughter rap veterans and stepping to get ahead of ‘em
I’m deadly as ever when I’m severing the heads of any
Competitor stepping and only show ‘em if they have weapons let ‘em in
Call me Spartacus ‘cause I’m swinging for the fences
With a bulletproof flow and a razor sharp sentence
Say it ‘cause I meant it… copy paste edit
Rap sheet long as the Lord of the Rings credits
I upset it when I said it and shred up all of these pathetic
Excuses for hip-hoppers it’s over as soon as I get it
Poison dart frog venom rap deadly
In a Nissan Honda Chevy
It’s Joell Ortiz and Webby
And this time around they’re not ready
‘Cause I’ve got my wanted level up like Tommy Vercetti
No Vice City but I’ll show you quite quickly
What it’s like to look up at the lights if you fight with me

[Hook: La Roux and Chris Webby]
This time baby I’ll be… bulletproof
We be to hard with it
This time baby I’ll be… bulletproof
Too many dope bars with it
This time baby I’ll be… bulletproof
Kevlar with it, so don’t start with it
We got our hearts in it, lyrical semi automatic (popopopopopop)

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Say my name say my name
From a student of the game to a lame’s claim to fame
Throwing shots at Joe’ll make you hot they taking aim
But I’m the best vest bulletproof like Adam Sandler and Damon Wayans
You throw a jab I’ll weave
You throw a hook I jump this ruckus gut and turn your mug to dust with an uppercut
You’re fucking nothing praisers be gay they ain’t nothing much
When I was playing cops and robbers they jump double dutch
When I was on the block with armor
I watch those suckers duck and take the back streets on the block where I was bust a nut
With a big busted slut fucking with a bubble butt
When niggas mouth ran I’m the one who shut it up
I treat rap like the tracks the same rules apply
Mention Ortiz and I reply when it’s just you and I
No cameras no crowds no music guys
My gun says you ain’t bulletproof
Let’s see if my Ruger lie

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
You couldn’t hit me with a hollow tip
Even if you graduated with a sniper scholarship
Acknowledge it and fuck the politics
Cause if they need respect in my conglomerate
Then I'mma hit ‘em with a soccer kick
This ain’t the world cup
I got ‘em worked up
The mutant ninja rappers back
Bitches Surfs up
Cleats on tear the earth up
You heard yup
I cop trees and serve blunts then break it down and I burn up
Then burn down no way that you can stop me
Them beating me is as likely as seeing a jewish nazi
So I leave ‘em sleeping with the fishes like they Luca Brasi
‘Cause I love the fucking game in fact I think that cupid shot me
Juice and saki in my cup now who could touch this
The haters saying that that better must be dusting
‘Cause I ruggedly make love to beats
No condom when I bust it
Then I post it up on YouTube and Twitter just for the public

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Jitta On The Track]
So hitch hiked some nights and away I go
With a laptop midi and microphone
And I heard there's a place where the views much bigger
And the signs light up and there ain't no limits
Feel like it already, feel like I'm all ready
Give me one time for the music
There's only one life don't abuse it
Find yourself and then lose it
I wonder wonder what will change my life
I wonder wonder if I did not fight
I wonder wonder if it don't vibe right
I'll make sure that you go and spend yo' money
I got my team with me, they dream with me
They eat with me, that means they feast me
You gone' land the same way in a 360
Wanna smoke somewhere on the beach tipsy
Can't believe it's a dream, I'm so blessed I know
Yea, and away I go, I go

[Hook: Chris Webby + Jitta On The Track]
Cause I been California dreamin' (for so long)
Said love you momma but I'm leavin' (on my own)
Don't got too much in my pockets, one way ticket in my wallet
Send my love to everybody till I get back home
Said ohh you're gonna like it, ohh the lights are bright
And I can feel it comin', waitin' all my life
There's somethin' in the air, that got me feelin' right
The stars are on the ground, the vibe is in the night, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Yea, I think it's time that we hit the road
Bags packed to the brim, yo Jitt let's go
Takin' flight like Starfox 64
And peace out, to everybody who gone' miss me though
To a new time zone, better fix the watch
Cause it feels like 6 o'clock
At the after party, but I sipped a lot
So I'm losin' track, but it still don't stop
Cause we heard California was in a drought
But I think we got it all figured out
Made a quick pitstop at the In-N-Out
And then it's back to the studio that's in my house
Listen I been waiting for shot and the time is near
And the sun is high up, and the skies are clear
I'm a pioneer, and these stars on the sidewalk always gone' remind me of why I'm hear
With every step I take, it's everywhere we go to
Pocket full of dreams and a mic with Pro Tools
Givin' up's somethin' I won't do, like I'm doin' Sudoku
Got a whole lot of numbers to go through
Watching my expenses until I'm in the Benz's
And got the whole world on my friends list
Lookin' at my life through my Ray Ban lenses
Here to strike gold out west like I dreamt it, I been

[Bridge]
California dreamin'
California dreamin'

[Hook: Chris Webby + Jitta On The Track]
Cause I been California dreamin' (for so long)
Said love you momma but I'm leavin' (on my own)
Don't got too much in my pockets, one way ticket in my wallet
Send my love to everybody till I get back home
Said ohh you're gonna like it, ohh the lights are bright
And I can feel it comin', waitin' all my life
There's somethin' in the air, that got me feelin' right
The stars are on the ground, the vibe is in the night, oh



[Chorus: Alandon]
Pardon me when I pull up with a small army
Better drink up 'cause the bars on me
We be going all night 'til the stars get bright
And the moon light falls on me

Wanna have a good time, then call the landline
Yeah it's fine, you can call on me

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You can call on me ain't no call waitin'
I'ma pick up, first ring on my land line
Headed down to the Keys with a pretty young thing
With them tight ripped jeans showing tan lines
And I ain't worried about nothing
You can hit me on the wifi
Send that location I'm coming
I'll hit your hot spot girl you know I-I-I-I
I give it to you like that
You can see them three dots when I write back
You know its simple, similar to a light snack
When I bite that, let me be your night cap
Girl, you can call me in the night, man
If its chaotic, I got it, baby I'm right there
Call me young Star-Lord flying though the cosmos
But I got my iPhone, just in case you call on me
You can put it all on me, lil mama
I think it just dawned on me that I wanna
Take this night to the limit, I know you like it, admit it
So baby you just gotta dial the digits and meet me at the bodega I'ma pop a bottle and some papers
And we can get lost, take a flight to Malaysia
Call on me I got unlimited data
I'll be as quick as Sonic on my Sega

[Chorus: Alandon]
Pardon me when I pull up with a small army
Better drink up 'cause bars on me

You can call on me, ain't no call waiting

We got no need for discussion yeah we always on the same page

Got a bitty in the city who be riding with me
Lil modern hippy rolling sticky 'til she got me dizzy
You can parley with me, 'bout the world baby
I don't really think I ever met no one like you in my life
She beautiful, tight and smart, the Miss Universe type
And I just hope that I'm maneuvering right
So uh, hey ma, let's ride, alright
Baby girl, listen we gonna get it on tonight
You can meet me in the bedroom
Or that black muscle car with the leg room
On the coast line she my Ariel on the beach
Thick as Jessica Rabbit but she the Belle to my Beast
My Lola Bunny on the court hitting all 3's
Or my Jasmine, heir to the throne that I seek
My Mulan on the battlefield, Nala to my pride
No surprise that I got you on my mind

[Chorus: Alandon]
Pardon me when I pull up with a small army
Better drink up cause bars on me
We be going all night 'til the stars get bright
And the moon light falls on me
Universe and harmony, vibe so right bet it all on me
Wanna have a good time, then call the landline
Yeah it's fine, you can call on me
Baby, you can call on me, call on me
Listen baby, you can call on me
[??]



[Intro: Chris Webby]
Chase the high until it fades
Better pace myself
Push my limits everyday
Till I break myself
My time is on the way, ay, ay, ay
Better brace myself
'Cause if I didn't give this shit my all I swear to god I couldn't face myself

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I been telling these stories about my life (my life, my life)
Out around a campfire all night (out around a campfire all night)
Just trying to find my through the moonlight (I'm just trying to find a way)
I'm just tryin' to hide my pain as I hydroplane
Till my tires strain in the left lane, with a depressed brain
Callin' my doctor up, hoping my med's came
Another panic attack feeling my chest tight
Can't even see the road, losing my head lights
I know

[Chorus: Chris Webby & Jitta On The Track]
I gotta keep on pushing through it
And my therapy is making music
Without it I think I would lose it
So gather round
Gather round, listen up
'Cause what's you know is, is not enough
Grab a blunt fill your cup
Let me tell you some'
Till the campfires out, campfires out
Telling stories til' the campfire's out
Light the match into the kerosene
Show what life is like behind the scene

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Put my soul up on a page as I judge myself
Cigarettes and cocaine, I don't trust myself
Drinking whiskey for the pain (ane, ane, ane) and blunt might help
Lacking self-respect with all the love I get why can't I find a way to love myself
I've been telling my stories to anyone listening (better listen, listen, listen)
I've done so much but still I feel so insignificant (insignificant, yeah, yeah)
Been battling all these demons ever since my christenin' (go to war with all these demons)
But still I'm hearin' breathin', tryna find a reason, why I'm breakin' even
I should have more by now from all these tours and crowds
But it's just me and this bottle, so I'm about to pour it down
Fire gonna scorch the ground while I be telling my tales
Follow a treacherous trail but in the end I prevail
I know

[Chorus: Chris Webby & Jitta On The Track]
I gotta keep on pushing through it
And my therapy is making music
Without it I think I would lose it
So gather round
Gather round, listen up
'Cause what you know is, is not enough
Grab a blunt, fill your cup
Let me tell you some'
Till the campfires out campfires out telling stories til' the campfire's out
Light the match into the kerosene
Show what life is like behind the scene

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I deal with afflictions by willingly filing prescriptions
I live with conditions that really don't fit the descriptions
My grit and conviction's the reason I'm still in existence
My will and ambition's the reason I'm still in the business
Still I just wish I could turn off the shit in my brain
The positive and all negative, livin' the yin and the yang
I'm still insecure even when they be telling me, "Webby, you killing the game"
But feel like I'm still in the rain, I wait for these feelings to change
A fifth of the Jameson, I'll sip it away
Just give me whatever, I don't want to deal with this pain
Simple and plain, I don't want to bitch and complain
My life really isn't so bad, I'm making a living, it's strange
That I'm even feeling this way, I gotta be tough for the fans
I gotta be tough for my team, I gotta be tough for my fam'
People are counting on me and I cannot fuck up the plan
Just give me a bottle, I'm fine, I'll bottle it up in advanced
Don't stop and check in on myself, I just keep on moving ahead
My wounds never heal completely, no time for the bruises to mend
I push it all down like society says I should do as a man
Don't know how to talk about it but when written in music, I can
This is the way I get through with this music is all that I got
On top of that, I run a business, I need to be callin' the shots
With all the pressure of that mixed with the pressure of life
Got all this pressure that's pressing me, feel like my heads in a vice
I tell myself every night

[Chorus: Chris Webby & Jitta On The Track]
I gotta keep on pushing through it
And my therapy is making music
Without I think I would lose it
So gather round'
Gather round, listen up
'Cause what you know is, is not enough
Grab a blunt, fill your cup
Let me tell you some'
Till the campfires out, campfires out
Telling stories til' the campfire's out
Light the match into the kerosene
Show what life is like behind the scene

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
All I had was a dream and a mixtape
And some birthday money that I saved up
Told myself I could be great
And that mindset never changed up
I don't need it all, I could be straight
With an iTunes check as a pay stub
But then it popped off on release date
And since then we been on the way up
And we almost there and it feels so lovely
Not rich yet but I'm gonna be
Movin' on up from Double Tree
To the Ritz hooked up with couple suites
Till then I'mma still live comfortably
But money ain't shit when you love to be
On the clock, and this shit's fun to me
So yo Juice go and pump the beat (let's go)
Way back when I played that minor league
It seemed nobody would ever make time for me
It seemed nobody had plans of signing me
So I grinded and grinded, then finally
It's time to be, the very same guy you see
On websites they cite Web, the sight of the blind would see
There's no chance of denyin' me
I'll collect my own god damn finder's fee

[Hook: Chris Webby]
I ain't ballin' but I got a little money
Ain't a super star but I'm on TV
Ain't a player but I got a couple honies
Whiskey bottle, bag of weed
I got everything I need
I can't complain
(Nah, nah, nah. Nah, nah nah)
Nah, nah I can't complain, nah nah I can't complain, nah, nah, nah, nah
(Nah, nah, nah. Nah, nah, nah)
Nah nah I can't complain, nah, nah I can't complain

[Verse 2: Anoyd]
It's colder than a mother fucker out this bitch
And I don't even smoke weed rollin' up a spliff, I'm thinking if I should out this bitch
Who next on the swish like JR Smith
Rubbin elbows macaroni in a jar
Like an international call you phony from afar Saying nothing in a hole like Zeroni in the yard
This is 24/7 like Kobe and Lamar
Antique in a museum you better to dust, you said it? Adjust
Typical Connecticut stuff, Yeah
We all know you ain't ready to trust, so
I'm poor to the line like a measuring cup, Yeah
I'm a be here till whenever the fuck, pretty much in the mirror like gra-ta-ta-ta-ta
They love ANoyd like bada-pa-pa-pa
And I don't got no job, I can't complain tho

[Hook: Chris Webby]
I ain't ballin' but I got a little money
Ain't a super star but I'm on TV
Ain't a player but I got a couple honies
Whiskey bottle, bag of weed
I got everything I need
I can't complain
(Nah, nah, nah. Nah, nah nah)
Nah, nah I can't complain, nah nah I can't complain, nah, nah, nah, nah
(Nah, nah, nah. Nah, nah, nah)
Nah nah I can't complain, nah, nah I can't complain

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Back when nobody was givin' a damn
They were shootin' me down just like Missile Command
So I pictured a plan, when I needed a dollar I sat up at night and envisioned a grand
Now I'm gettin' a tan, with my kicks in the sand
With a spliff in my hand, and a chick with no pants
With a beautiful crib and a bottle of Jamie
What else can I say? I just cannot complain, see
I started with nothin' so somethin' is so
Fuckin' amazing I'm lovin' it yo
Wouldn't say that I'm rich but enough of the dough's in my pocket to live my life comfortable bro
All I need is a fair amount, for all the work that I've carried out
I moved out of my parent's house, now the top is my whereabouts

[Hook: Chris Webby]
I ain't ballin' but I got a little money
Ain't a super star but I'm on TV
Ain't a player but I got a couple honies
Whiskey bottle, bag of weed
I got everything I need
I can't complain
(Nah, nah, nah. Nah, nah nah)
Nah, nah I can't complain, nah nah I can't complain, nah, nah, nah, nah
(Nah, nah, nah. Nah, nah, nah)
Nah nah I can't complain, nah, nah I can't complain



[Hook}
You can’t deny me, baby, why would you want to, you need me
You can’t deny me, baby you want to, you need me
Can’t deny me, baby you want you, believe me
Can’t deny me, baby you want you, you need me

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I’m rappin' it phat, back to attack
The stork hit my mom's bedroom and delivered a baggy of crack
Cause I rap hot, since playin' with Match Box
Spittin' shit prestigious like level 50 in Black Ops
It's that dirtyness, got em seein' stars like Galileo and Copernicus
Kill them with the wordy shit
Clashin' with the mothafuckin' Titans like I'm Perseus
Searchin' for a perk, a 40, and a pair of perky tits
Spittin' sars baby, everything I said's ill
Pop an X pill, movin' on the next kill
First degree, murder beats with the best skill
Runnin' shit like Mr. Hankey on a treadmill
They don’t even understand what I be rappin'
Tearin' down mic's, CT to Manhattan
Haters try to hate, but can’t compete with Webby's passion
Slaughterin' a verse, Statik hit 'em with the scratchin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Speakin' tight, every day I’m beatin' mic's
Run up in the Asian restaurant and eat up Condoleezza's Rice
Bless a track like my semen's spliced with Jesus Christ
Cause there’s a lot of cheese, all I want's a freakin' slice
And a chick with tats and Double D's is all I need in life
And if she cooks I'll reconsider if I need a wife
They see my skin color, so they don’t believe I’m nice
But it don't matter if I’m black, blue, green or white
Cause I’ve been killin' rhyme schemes since my adolescence
I kill a beat mothafucker, better grab a medic
I'll work your girlfriend out like calisthenics
And grant her sexual wishes just like Aladdin said it
From the past to present, I attack with vengeance
Grindin' like that teeth of someone with a crack dependence
Try to get my money up so I can stack and spend it
And take my competition out just like a bad appendix

[Hook]

Can’t deny me, baby you want to, believe me



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I don’t have a Master’s or Bachelor’s
Just a certificate sayin’ “Certified Rapper”
Fresh, fly, and dapper
Cracker with cheese, with Connecticut steez
Bitch I’m cooler than a summertime breeze, ho please
In my jeans two cojones, you better respect
You couldn’t get me with a net, I’m the Deadliest Catch
The record labels ever seen, lettin’ off steam
Sippin’ lean, American jumpin’ bean
I’m a fiend for the opposite sex
When I put your feet up by your neck, baby make us both sweat
Yes, I’m a damn dog like a Labrador
Everyday I’m baggin’ whores, fuck you think I’m rappin’ for?
And so what I be comin’ out of Connecticut?
I’m sick of rappers gettin’ big with no prerequisites
I be certified check the rap sheet
While other kids were math geeks and athletes, I was a rap freak
Cause you know that I’m about to get it poppin’
No start button for you, there’s no option
Sippin’ a concoction, I’m no boy from Boston
The tri-states ridin' with me, and stay rockin’
Never spit a flow that you won’t feel
Givin’ you the news, fuckin’ April O’Neill
Got a Casey Jones flow, baby you can never doubt me
Ten foot dick, balls bigger than Lebowski

[Hook]
Bitch I’m certified, what you think about that?
Cause half these cats nowadays can’t even rap
Baby I be certified, this is just a fact
Freestyle, written, whatever it’s all crack
Baby I be certified, goin’ to the top
Cause I can actually spit, this ain’t no pop
Baby I be certified, make the crowd rock
And do it all out of my love for this Hip-Hop
Baby I be certified

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Crtified, yes I be certified
So if you comin’ with the beef, then I’ll be servin’ fries
Murder guys with the style I run
From here to kingdom come and then some son (what?)
Professor Plum with the candle stick
Killin’ beats, yo I’m on my Charles Manson shit
Hardcore, yo they softer than the Hanson clique
Get buns everyday another random chick
Got my own lingo, never understandin' others
Roll deep with a muthafackin’ band of brothers
So flawless you’ll be thinkin’ “Uh, can he stutter?”
Nah not this slick-tongued panty-stuffer
You’d think Einstein lived in my house
Get brains all day cause that’s what wisdom’s about
Summer Sanders sucked my dick until I Figured It Out
And then I sent her back to Nick with my kids in her mouth
Cause you know I get it done d-d-done-d-done over any beat
Just give me any one w-w-one-w-one
With styles vicious got you wanna fuckin’ run-r-run
Cause there’s a lot of money, all I want is suh-s-suh-s-suh-s-suh-s-some
And I’m back-b-back, givin’ hip hop somethin’ that it lack-l-lacks
A little creativity up on the tra-tr-track
Webby’s certified no debatin’ that-th-that-th-that-th-that

[Hook]



[Intro]
Crazy world we live in man, now more so than ever
You know we're at a pivotal point in history
If shit keeps going the way it's going right now
Man, I don't even wanna think about it sometimes
But you have to, you always gotta be aware of what's going on around you
No one man or woman can change the world by themselves

[Verse 1]
I'm a hundred percent made in the USA and ain't nobody gonna change that
But how many people can we have our nuclear missiles aimed at
Before somebody steps up and aims back
That how they startin' to react all over the map
Got the weapons to attack for an oil contract
Average American's a travelin' man
Given a gun and boots send um to Iraq and Iran
US gettin' that oil money that is the plan
Against mother fuckers with bombs in that back of the van
Shit you gotta see it from a different side
The saftey of America is livin' a lie
Your enemies don't give a fuck if they live it and die
Or bombs that can change the world in a blink of an eye
So I live for the day when I step in the ring
Because tomorrow is definitely not a definite thing

[Hook x2]
I'm not here to change the world, I'm just doin' what I do
A lot's going on right now I'm just tryna make it through (true)
And I'm not here to change the world, I'm just giving you a point of view
But, I'mma do my part but then it's up to you (do)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, while you at home worryin' about payin' the bills
Scientists workin' on some new ways to kill
Everybody need to light a fuckin' j and chill
Cuz if it stays this way, be afraid for real
I'm not sayin' everybody gotta be best friends
But it's to the point I can't watch CNN
While we should be goin' forward we all headed backwards
If it ain't a war it's a natural disaster
We took the world and we ripped it up
And now mother nature's pissed at us
And we fuckin' with a force that we can't controll
And if we don't change somethin' we'll pay the toll
Generations before us said it's not my problem
Thanks a lot guys now it's on us
I'm just doin' what I ought to do
Because it's time to make a change and it starts with you (do)

[Hook x2]

[Outro (Guitar Solo by: David Webster)]
Dj Drama: David Webster let it talk to um!!



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Gotta let go and set your mind free
Cut loose from the powers that be now
And the people say follow me
Vibrations shape the revolution
Biddy bye-bye, they go-o away
All the problems that show up
See they can't not control us
So just sit back and roll up a J
When things aren't going my way
Keep a hold on my faith to the world to the end of times
I just sit there warp drive on the Enterprise
It's heatin' up and I can feel the pressure rise
No, never, they will not divide us
So we gon' rise up let the vibe set the tone, it's gon guide us
You just gotta get control over what's inside ya
Let the love bless your soul
Swallow your pride get ya vibe and go oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Webby]
Lend me your ear, free your mind
You just gotta sit back and check the vibe
And the skyline's clear, so it's about time
Everybody sit back and check the vibe
Wise man, me no need no education
All I do is sit back and check the vibe
So lend me your ear, let me free your mind

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Gotta let go and set your mind free
Gotta stand up for what you believin'
When the time comes you gon' see
Vibrations shape the revolution
Biddy bye-bye to all of my fears, you
Should never look back
Don't get lost in the past
You gotta leave all that behind in the rearview
Now roll those windows down so they hear you
Let me hear you say (Oh, oh, oh)
We gon' never lose the vibe
Now let me hear you say (Oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, we never gonna lose the vibe
We never lose the vibe
Hop on a wave, we can cruise the tidal or choose to fly
So blessed, we can move the sky
And change the world, it starts with just you and I
Yeah, it starts with just you and I

[Chours: Chris Webby]
Lend me your ear, free your mind
You just gotta sit back and check the vibe
And the skyline's clear so it's about time
Everybody sit back and check the vibe
Wise man, me no need no education
All I do is sit back and check the vibe
So lend me your ear, let me free your mind

[Bridge: Justina Valentine]
And I don't understand why the world so cold, yeah
So I keep on row, headin' down that road
Like it's all I know, I know, I know, I know
And I don't understand why the world so cold, yeah
So I keep on row, headin' down that road
Like it's all I know, I know, I know

[Chorus: Chris Webby & Justina Valentine]
Lend me your ear, free your mind
You just gotta sit back and check the vibe
And the skyline's clear so it's about time
Everybody sit back and check the vibe
Wise man, me no need no education
All I do is sit back and check the vibe
So lend me your ear, let me free your mind
You just gotta sit back and check the vibe



Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "Chemical Romance"
[Voicemail 1]
Hey it's Molly. Where have you been? We got another party going on tonight over at Stacy's. Let's get wild and make bad decisions together like we always used to. We're gunna be partying all night, c'mon Christian. Don't you miss me? Call me back fucker, love you

[Verse 1]
Dear Molly, I know that we've had our fun
Love the taste of you up on my tongue
But I'm thinkin' that we should be done
Been too many years of the same shit
You've almost driven me insane bitch
You'd whisper come give me a lick
And I'd come runnin' back, your dangerous
And you almost killed me in college remember that? What the fuck were you thinkin'
And you said that it wasn't your fault, blamed it on all the liquor I was drinkin'
But it was you! And still I came back to you lustin' and callin' you baby
And your sister? That's my ex Stacy
And both of you bitches are crazy
But I'm grown now, so listen Molly what I'm tellin' you is for the best
Cause I'm a mess when I'm with you
So with the cells in my brain that you left behind we're through
You're dead to me
Even though you were my remedy
I thought that we really were meant to be
But now you're only in my memories, so
I'm sorry Molly, I never meant to make you cry
Cause it's been great just you and I, but this is goodbye
And this is us breakin' up, I'm signin' and sealin' this letter
Sincerely yours, XOXO Christian Webster

[Hook: Chris Webby + Jaye Michelle ]
Rolled up twenties on the sink
Capsules poured into my drinks
It's been fun but now I think
It's time we move on, yeah
Goodbye, my chemical romance
Goodbye, my chemical romance
Goodbye, my chemical romance
It's time for me to go

[Voicemail 2]
Hey Christian, it's Lindsey. Why have I not seen you in so long? Come see me tonight, I want you to fuck me over and over again like you do, and we can stay up night and talk about how fucked up the world is, and you can freestyle for me. C'mon Christian, you know you want to. Call me back as soon as you get this, mwah

[Verse 2]
Dear Lindsey, you were my very first love
When I really started doin' drugs
And we've been on and off, but the rush
That you would give me, was amazin'
Till it wasn't, then I'm crazy
And I'm anxious, and I'm angry
And I lose sleep, cause you take me
Out to a place that I don't wanna be anymore, at this point there's just too much history
It was my seventeenth birthday, that's when you first took my virginity
And sooner than later I saw you on Fridays and saw you on Saturdays every week
Tried to break up with you numerous times but you'd always come back like I'm pressin' repeat
Get the fuck outta my head bitch
Don't call my phone up again bitch
Me and you ain't even friends bitch
Now your nothin' but my ex bitch
You hookin' up with everybody at the afterparty bitch I know your repertoire
They all lay you down on the countertop, then they line you up with a debit card
Then you got em takin' out they money just like you was a stripper
And I was a pretty good tipper
But now you'll be out of the picture, huh
Don't bother with tryin' to call, I've sank my final 8 ball
Steppin' away from the pool table once and for all, yea

[Hook: Chris Webby + Jaye Michelle ]
Rolled up twenties on the sink
Capsules poured into my drinks
It's been fun but now I think
It's time we move on, yeah
Goodbye, my chemical romance
Goodbye, my chemical romance
Goodbye, my chemical romance
It's time for me to go

[Voicemail 3]
Hey dude, what's up? I miss you. Oh, it's Xandra by the way. Um. Come cuddle. I just got the new Call Of Duty. And I got Oreos, your favorite. Come be lazy with me. Oh shit, my phones about to die, text me

[Verse 3]
Dear Xandra, you're the chill one, way more than the rest of my ex chicks
We would sit around, play video games, and cuddle while watchin' some Netflix
On all of those lazy days
Whenever the sky was a shade of grey
You'd make me feel all these amazin' ways
And all of my problems would fade away
But then I'd snap back to reality and wanna lose it
Had a to do list and didn't do shit
I was with you, don't you know I got a schedule too bitch?
I got me a life and this dream that I'm chasin'
But you tellin' me that I need medication
The moves in my life you would keep me from makin'
This easy arrangement is slowin' me down and I'm losin' the moments I need to embrace and
I'm pacin' I'm wastin' these minutes are fadin'
My motivation slowly slippin' away and
Procrastinatin' as we sittin' here layin'
And wake up confused again, at somethin' like 2 PM
And put off the shit that I'm supposed to do again, stuck here with you again
Cause I've been watchin' you ruin the lives of these people, so many others you've dated
Some of em landed in rehab, some of em just didn't make it
The doctor prescribin' your lovin' all over, but I'd rather be sober
Than wastin' my life with you, so take this letter as the closure, bitch

[Hook: Chris Webby + Jaye Michelle ]
Rolled up twenties on the sink
Capsules poured into my drinks
It's been fun but now I think
It's time we move on, yeah
Goodbye, my chemical romance
Goodbye, my chemical romance
Goodbye, my chemical romance
It's time for me to go







[Verse 1]
I'm on the edge, one step and I'll be over
Unless I take those 12 steps, aimed at gettin sober
That's the shit I told myself I'll handle when I'm older
And now I'm older and still got this devil on my shoulder
Bottle up my problems, like prescriptions I'm poppin
All the liquor that I find myself drinkin so often
Now these cards are dealt, told myself I don't need help
Numb myself to everything, and keep on runnin from myself

[Hook]
Let's drink away the pain
Let's make another toast
Let's smoke another blunt
Until it's just a roach
And pop another pill
And drop another dose
I haven't lost it yet
But now I'm coming close

I'm just chemically imbalanced (On that shit)
I'm just chemically imbalanced (Lost my grip)
I'm just chemically imbalanced (One way trip)
And now it's too late for turnin back (x5)

[Verse 2]
Left here to battle this addictive personality
That's got me living in this alternate reality
Losing touch with what is real ever so gradually
Cause at this point I need these chemicals to balance me
It's like I'm following a blueprint that the devil made
Since I first took my Ritalin in the 7th grade
The doctor gave me 60 milligrams, just a kid
Barely weighed a buck, it's like they used me as their guinea pig
Crazy teen, medicated ADD
Doctor said take only 1, but you know I was taking 3
Blazin tree and skippin class, getting drunk and missin math
Bangin chicks without a rubber, crushin pills up on the dash
Chemically imbalanced in this motherfucker, startin shit
Still I was a smart kid, got myself a scholarship
Private schools with it,  button-downs with the dockers
And the JanSport full of weed stuffed into my locker

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See I was blacking out weekly, livin on repeat
Still in highschool but the teachers could never reach me
Always was the fuck up with a chip on my shoulder
And a pocket full of anything to keep me from sober
See I was livin like there's no tomorrow
Chewin on a xany bar, rollin up the window smokin blunts up in family car
Bottles to the head, got detention on the reg
Never listenin to what my parents said
I was always rollin with an ounce or two
Everytime I'm bouncin through
Flippin everybody off like Shady taught me how to do
Always thinkin that the more we burnin, the merrier
Just a kid from middle-class suburban America
And so many others like me, listen to me nightly
Happy that somebody else is feelin' what they might be
So Christian pop a pill, oh yeah I bet you will
Cause if that shit don't make your problems any less forreal

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I keep it so chilly, really, see we stay killing it
Cue the theme music, I'm here on my super villain shit
Here to steal your women and hit it more than a little bit
So ladies grab your clitoris, Webby back up in this bitch
My women look like princesses, I got a job at Disney
Made Jasmin leave Aladdin, now I'm getting sloppy quickies
Cinderella's at the tellie and she drop it quickly
Ariel be sucking my dick when she under water with me
Yeah yeah, so let me grab my scuba tank
Stay faded, lighting up that uber stank
Outrageous, yeah you know I do my thing
DJ's bring my records back like they throwing boomerangs
Still I'm not a Freshman up on XXL
But fuck it, cuz me and Trel are more happy being expelled
We them bad motherfuckers smoking bogies during gym class
Dropouts, who got your girl's pants dropping quick fast

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Ride around town with the speakers up
The smell is coming from the tree we puff
And we so goddamn cold when they speak to us
Got these little hoes freezing up
We keep it so chilly (na na na na na)
So motherfucking chilly (na na na na na)
Everybody rocking with me (na na na na na)
So damn chilly (na na na na na)

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
I see three pretty bitches out the corner of my eye
Spring, but a chilly day outside
They run around my way to get themselves into shape
My Desert Eagle and my K outside
Now usually when I'm cooling with two white freaks
I like to fly and lay the pipe on the beach
But today's downtown, tinted window, blowing loud
We finna see what she like in the Gleesh
In Connecticut my college bitch got proper etiquette
Bands and good pussy, but the head come better with
I be trying to focus while I'm stroking it raw
But she too busy plotting on the dollars, some hoes
I was busy blowing something stronger than hope
Trash cans for the liquor bottles and Trojans
Webby in the Chevy like the shit ain't stolen
I'm ready, if you ready we can get it to go
So let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
See we keeps it so motherfucking frigid
A Fahrenheit digits
So cold that the wheels on your vehicle skidded
Causing ice on the roads, better go the speed limit
And turn them defrosters on when we spit it
Eyes bloodshot, got me pulling down my fitted
Stay lifted, you would think that I was practicing Quidditch
Put a charm spell right on these bitches before I hit it
Got Hermione on my magic stick, baby come and get it
I just killed another bottle
And took another pill, now I'm going full throttle
Keep hating, Hakuna Matata's my motto
I brush em off like a paleontologist with a fossil
Call me young brothel, you're fucked if you step
Bitch I'm chilly, you could feel them goosebumps on your neck
A++, when I come it's correct
With a chick on my lap, in the tub getting wet

[Hook]



Welcome, welcome! All you ninjas!
Come on in and make some room
Move on over, now! Go- Watch out for the baby head!
The baby... you about to head the baby in the head..
Now, why you gotta take up both seats? just move on over!
Lets start the show
We have a special guest tonight... He goes by the name of Chris Webby
Now, this young man, hails from Connecticut
And now, after SIX MIXTAPES
After HALF A MILLION DOWNLOADS
After 20 MILLION YOUTUBE VIEWS
Countless SOLD OUT shows
And many a SATISFIED FAN!
All you ninjas, give a warm welcome to your... CHRIS WEBBY

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah, you see I’m buzzin’ now
Shovel in hand, I dug from the underground
Lyrical artillery loaded with forty-dozen rounds
They used to run they mouth, shit, they Daffy Duckin’ now!
Came out spittin', first photo shoot was my ultrasound
Throwin’ up my middle fingers in my mother’s uterus
Spittin’ fire off a the top, Mount Vesuvius
Always caught disturbin' the peace, they said I was ludicrous
Crazy, unpredictable, nutty, but never stupid, bitch
Smart guy like Taj Mowry, eatin’ pot brownies
On the run for killin' beats until the fuckin’ cops found me
On the loose again, apple juice and gin
Outmaneuverin’ my enemies, leave ‘em with sutures in
Cut ‘em up, cause my flow is sharper than Excalibur
Maximus, Decimus, Maridius to these challengers
Gladiator in the flesh, swingin' for your fuckin' neck
Slicin' up these beats, while you bitches can even cut a check
Up next, final stop, success, like…

Now hold on, now hold up, hold on now, hold on...
You gots to teach these boys how to rap..
Cause what these boys out here is doing, is not rap, it's WACK!
You got to show them the multi-syllable schemes
You got to show them the air-tight flow
You got to show them, them punchlines
Now get on in there and do your thing, son!

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Everything I do, I do it with heart
Werewolf with a full moon in the dark
Tear a fuckin' human apart, I’m stupidly smart
Started on the east, but my music made a westward expansion
Somethin' like Lewis and Clark, climbin' up the musical charts
And me fallin' off?, that’s like Bullseye from Daredevil losin' in darts
I’m just a crazy motherfucker
Who was bred to be a monster, since the eighties motherfucker
I’m lyrically inclined, put my spirit in my rhymes
Veins pumpin’ Hip-Hop, you can hear it in my lines
Rollin’ with a bunch of goons, everyday we grindin’ on
And we all spark, you can catch me up on Cybertron
I am on everything, Bad Meets Evil-er
That’s just how the cookie crumbles, motherfuckin' Keebler!
Mark my teachers words, they told me that I should be mature
But now that my pockets beefed up, I’m never goin' vegan, sir
Grindin’ ‘till the fuckin’ day I stop breathin', word!



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I’m in flight school, I’m takin’ flight brother
Pilot of my own plane like the Wright brothers
Pull an Amelia Earhart
And just sky-rocket to the top of the charts
I’m with John Glenn and Neil Armstrong on the moon
Blastin’ off to Mars, I should be there soon
Skip Jupiter and hop right over to Neptune
Hit warp drive, aliens be smellin’ the fumes
I’m so fly I’m in the galaxy, no handlin’ me
I chill on Pluto, cause man you’re still a planet to me
I take flight everyday, launch pad, okay
Rock Orion’s Belt and dip my cookies in the Milky Way like

[Hook]
Come, come fly away with me
We’ll wander through the stars
And touch down on Mars
So come and fly away with me
No need for gravity out in the galaxy
So come and fly

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I live it how I say when I ride that beat
Not even Captain Kirk know how to fly like me
In outer space, somethin’ like Anakin
Then I turn to Vader and can’t nobody damage him
I could make the planet spin, peace and I’m outta here
Lightin’ up a blunt as I’m passin’ through the atmosphere
Pass it to my passenger, mami’s gettin’ high now
Me and her are nothin’ but a light up in the sky now
Sex on a space station and she loves it
No gravity needed we just does it
Fly can’t top me, can’t nobody stop me
Better get your telescope out and just watch me
Yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I am now so fly that astronomers study me
Time to fly away, mami you should come with me
Scoop her up in the Big Dipper
Crash-land on Saturn, burn and sip liquor
Earth is okay, I’m right here today
But tomorrow I’m gonna be light-years away
No Apollo 13, mothafuck a space shuttle
Way above SkyLab, stars, and the Hubble
Causin’ mad trouble, cause home was too boring
But I’ll be back eventually when I’m finished exploring
So, ground control to Major Tom
I’m gone to infinity and beyond

[Hook]

So come and fly
So come and fly
If you could fly, would you fly with me, with me?
If you could fly, would you fly with me?



[Intro]
Yeah! It's Chris Webby
Up in Webster's Laboratory right now, you know
Just cooking some shit up!
As I said, bars for days
Let's go

[Verse 1]
First of all, shout to Chiddy Bang yo
But it’s Webby and I still be Off The Chain, so
I’ll get your girl and do what you seeing on Bang Bros
Stacking YouTube hits like a double rainbow
So fresh, got a Old Spice old feel
Tryna stay on course like a boat's keel
They wanna know how I be killin’ it with no deal
And got the game mapped out, Michael Scofield
No prison break, get up here and renovate
Every venue that I’m hittin’ up in every state
Twist a zig-zag then I levitate
Webby been bad, professor Snape
I’m like Manny Pacquiao times four
Hyping up the crowd when I’m out on tour
I need a dollar like I told you before
So I could cop an Arnold Palmer when I’m hittin’ the store
Encore, I used to pop pills, always puffin’ bud
I think I’m still rollin’, Team Pup N’ Suds
Now I’m going big time and I’m lovin’ this
When I step in, dudes better cuff your chick
I don’t speak game, I say a couple words
Next thing you know we’re both under the comforter
In the comfort of my hotel suite
Having sloppy drunk sex and forget 'em by next week
I’m a beast, reppin’ Connecticut like a husky
CT swag, everybody here loves me
Got a stainless steel flow, never spit it rusty
Running shit like Nucky, trust me
Name buzzin’ all over the fuckin’ country
Shout to my ninjas and everybody who bumps me
So just feed me beats, I got the munchies
Nothing better than an instrumental when I’m hungry
The illest thing that ever hit pro tools
I’m 1-51, they just O'Doules
Live by no rules, no one’s stoppin’ me
They say Webby rocks, Geology
Even haters gotta bump my shit
So what, thanks for the YouTube hits you dumb bitch
Put me in the mix, I’ma be the last spittin’
I’m a tiger, y’all domesticated cat, kitten
You’ll get smacked kitten, left there with your cash missin’
It’s a fact, listen, I’ll be on a track rippin’
Haters crack jokes, I just laugh with ‘em
And get loud, like Waka Flocka ad-libing
Spit venom out, every time I rap rhythms
Webby’s the deadliest catch, I’m goin’ crab fishin’
Teachin’ hip-hop 101, so take notes
Bring it back, mu'fucker I’m done



[Verse 1 :Chris Webby]
I'm at the bottom of the barrel, the end of the blunt
The edge of the cliff, feelin' my brain tellin' me to jump
The struggle in my heart, me and you we don't bleed the same
And with probation I can't even burn to ease the pain
I've been down and out, kicked out, locked up
For that stupid shit way back at Hofstra, lots a
Stress everyday suit and tie go to court
And I try to pull it together of course
But everyday I'm

[Hook: Daniel Za]
I'm crashing down, first I fall apart
Then I get back up when I hit the ground
I'm crashing down, can't stop my flows
Cause baby you don't know how long I been down

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I'm feelin' frustrated, fed up with all this rap stuff
Down so long, how you expect me to get back up?
Bail money, lawyer money, how I'm supposed to answer that?
Fuck gettin' paid, I'm just tryna pay my parents back
I'll be settlin' my debt until I sell a millie
Although I'm happy I'm not sittin' in a cell
I really feel like rock bottoms just a couple steps in front of me
I guess God feels he's gotta punish me
So I keep

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Every thing I've ever known is crashin' down around me
The stresses in my life about to drown me
Drink until I'm drowsy, hopin' for the best
Cause now I just got too many people I must impress
They say I've got some Shady in me, and just maybe Webby is next
That's a heck of a lot of pressure, but an excellent rep
So I'll heckle my competition, get ahead of the rest
Maybe what they say is true, and I was meant for success
Yes, so now my biggest enemy is my personality
Tryin' to stay away from all the drugs that used to balance me
Tryna stay away from the trouble that used to draw me in
Just tryna focus on the music and the audience
I gotta have these inner demons all defeated
If I plan to be successful, and I will you best believe it
I'm on to do this rappin' shit, I mean it
SO when I crash down into the ashes I'll arise like the phoenix
And I

[Hook(x2)]



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I couldn't stop starin' when I saw her at the bar
Walked over and introduced, she said "I know who you are"
She said she liked the rapper type, no matter if their black or white
And I'm like, "Hmm, it looks like I'm gettin' ass tonight"
Spit some ill game then it was back to the house
Bent her over then I hit it from the back on the couch
Banged out for two hours then she slipped me her digits
Called that bitch the next day cause I still had to hit it
Then the night after that, then the night after that
To the point I'm thinkin' I might wife it in fact
We decided to go out, it started goin' well
The sex was straight ill, plus she was sexy as hell
But she was obsessive as fuck, straight up nuts
Started lookin' through my facebook, texts and stuff
Comin' at me like "Who's Amy?" "Nobody, you're my baby"
But little did she know that I'd been bangin' Amy lately

[Hook]
(She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me)
Oh yea... that text, that text message was nothin' baby
Amy's uhh... Amy's my study partner in class
(She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go)
We, we do like lab's and shit together, I swear to God yo
(She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me)
Yea don't worry about it, you my baby
(She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go)
Stupid ass mother fuckin' bitch
Can't stand this bitch!

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
We still stayed together cause the sex was unbeatable
But she was straight obsessive to the point it's unbelievable
I still hit Amy on the side with stealth
Comin' home to, "If you left me, I'd kill myself
For real, I love you baby, we'll always be together
We'll get married, have kids, and love each other forever"
And I'm like, "Uhhh, shit she's a nuts bitch
A psycho, one I never should have fucked with"
The next day I come home and she's sittin' all alone
Balling her eyes out and lookin' through my damn phone
"So who the fuck's Amy? I just read this text
'Last night was amazing, ' oh what'd you have sex?"
"Baby she's my study partner yo, don't you remember?"
"In what fucking class? You said that shit last semester!"
"You know what fuck this, grab all your shit
And get the fuck out of my house, crazy ass bitch!"

[Hook]
(She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me)
Yea that's right get, the fuck outta here
Crazy mother fuckin' bitch
(She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go)
Grab your shoes
Yea grab those stank ass underwear from out of my room too
(She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me)
I ain't even playin' with you bitch, get the fuck out
(She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go)
All in my shit yo, what the fuck is wrong with you? Get the fuck out
Damn!

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
We broke up, but I still can't get rid of this female
She called, sent texts, shit she even left emails
Just tryna get her out of my life, she's really scarin' me
(Phone ring) "Hi baby," "Bitch go seek therapy!"
So one night me and Amy come back to the crib
Flip the lights on, and there she is
Holdin' a pistol and I'm like "Where the fuck'd you get a gun?"
"What I never told you? My dad has one
Oh what, so I finally get to meet this little whore?"
(Bang, Bang) And Amy dropped to the floor
"You been fuckin' her the whole time and called me baby!"
"I can see why your angry but you ain't have to shoot Amy!"
Now my mind's racin' as I thought of the words
"Just give me the gun babe, we'll go back to the way we were."
"You promise?" "I promise, I love you yo
Just give me the gun please, yea, nice and slow"

[Hook]
(She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me)
"Yea there you go, just give me... there you go
(She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go)
Pull a fucking gun on me! ? Are you out of your fucking mind?
(She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me)
You fucking psycho bitch, you have crossed the mother fuckin' line!
(She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go)
Nah, nah ya know what, BITCH!
(Gun cock and fire)
Oh shit...
(She's not so usual.)



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
It’s lights, camera, action, run it and still rappin’
Lyrical tornado, twister, Bill Paxton
On two E pills, three vics and six aspirin
This bull’s running plays on the court like Phil Jackson
I am mad raw, fucker, better back off
Punch line pros, we leaving you with a cracked jaw
Down in MIA sniffing on some bath salts
Eat your fucking face off and spit it on the asphalt
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Call up Rick Grimes and aim for the head and shoot at least six times
Connecticut to Shaolin, show ‘em what the bounce is
Coming with that fire so you better bring an ounce, kid
It’s that motherfucker fucking panty stuffer, listen to the real can’t stand the others
Cop a lethal weapon like Danny Glover
Walk into the woods bust rounds at Bambi’s mother, uh

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Live and let die, I get it like I spit it, we ride like an AMG, get it? G5
Five, Michael in it, got the key to the city
We vibe, no commercial interruptions, we live
Warning, see now that you have entered the zone
Professionals at work, do not attempt this at home
All I need’s a verse and a minute when it’s on
I’ll be begging like a convict for minutes on the phone
Up until they throw me in a box, or catch me in the trap, trying to throw away the rock
I’m a product of the block, a hustler, the product in the socks
Serve a customer, regardless of the cops
Regardless of the guap, still a legend
On fire, cause I’m hot, y’all are sweating, still denying that I’m not
In fact, Webby, I’m like the overweight lover, I’m that heavy
Minus the frames and fat belly

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
Thanks for that Meth, we do this man you know
CT to Shaolin, C. Webby to John Blaze
It’s just that hip hop shit, you know, it’s that
That raw emotion that you get when you get behind this mic, like you know?

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Suburban rap savior's back, slay it when I lay a track
The fourth Animaniac, the Timothy McVeigh of rap
They so concerned with swag that they forgot about the basics
That’s some shit I can’t respect, I’ll never hold my tongue or take it back
This is art, this is true, this is all I know
The only time I feel at peace is when I start to flow
I don’t care if the masses think that my shit’s hot
Cause this is raw, this is me, this is hip hop



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I get rowdy, rough, drunk, excited and amped
On the table all night, I'm the beer pong champ
Drink until my mothafuckin’ liver gets cramps
And I've lost everything within the pockets of my pants
Like, “Shit where's my phone? Keys? Shit, who has my wallet?”
“Dude, you probably lost it, you stupid alcoholic”
Ha, fuck you bitch, I weigh 160
So it only takes a few shots to get myself tipsy
A few more then I'm drunk, then I move on to wasted
Then black out, find me passed out on the pavement
Slurring every statement, vision getting blurry
Sippin’ 40's from four-forty to two-thirty
I'm dirty, plus I ball like Michael
Get wasted like plastic that isn't recycled
I'm too fly, rhymin’ it nice
So drunk I could get a DUI on a bike
Mix up the lime with a little coconut
Takin’ shots outta half-filled solo cups
Get smashed like dropped pottery
Probably couldn't walk a straight line If I had a fuckin’ cop watchin’ me
Walkin’ into shit like I couldn't avoid it
Just lookin’ for a girl, tryna’ make some poor choices
But whether I get laid or end up in a brawl
I just blame it on the a-a-alcohol

[Hook]
Cuz I'm drunk
So do not play around with me cuz I'm drunk
Somebody take away my keys cuz I'm drunk
Shit I can barely even see
I think it's time to make some bad decisions cuz I’m drunk

[Verse 2: Mic Galper]
I come through already blunted like flip cup, who want it?
Twenty on the table son, I'm about to make a hundred
You can make it rain but I'm 'bout to make it sunny
That means I keep my money, buddy I'm not a dummy
“Day and Night” it's the kid, lookin’ for some Cudi
Got my homie Chris Webby to make sure she ain't chubby
Cause I drank a lot of bubbly, in the living room stumblin’
Everybody lookin' lovely but I came here for the pussy
I love to start beef son I can't control it
Might wake up with missin’ teeth like The Hangover
I might wake up with a naked slut from Angola
I don't know bro, I'm just saying I ain't stayin’ sober
So move over 'fore this fat bitch puts roofies in my cola
Cool that's what I wanted wrestling sumo with polar
Bear, beware when it's time to go upstairs
Fuck a Trojan, got socks make sure you wear a pair

[Hook]



[Hook]
Drinkin’, smokin’, poppin’, rollin’
Fuckin’ ‘till my condom’s broken
Stackin’ chips, and bangin’ chicks
We livin’ life so dangerous, now let’s go!

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Uhh, yeah
Webby back and I told you what
Get up on the stage and I show his nuts
Microphone and my Kobra Klutch
What, Jack Frost on the beat cause I be too cold to touch
Hit ‘em with the rhythm that be dope as fuck
Baby girl hit your knees and open up
CT Vandal, and I never gave a shit don’t plan to
Cause I’m here to make a splash like Shamu
Damn you, ran through, any competition that I can do
Can you figure the flow and keep pace?
Joints rolled up to the face
Turn up the bass ‘till my windows break
Flow well done, let me raise the stakes
Since '88 I been a mother fuckin’ monster, man
Had headphones on in my sonogram
Came out so mean that the doctor ran
And had a full-ass diaper of contraband
God damn, I’m killin’ the flow that’s the plan
Fuckin’ every girl I can
Ball like Jordan; Space Jam
Pass me the rock and I’ll hit ‘em with a slam
D-d-done, bass line coming out the drum
Always stay drunk with a full-ass blunt
Money up front, chasing cheddar
Can’t stop me, bitch, I’m way too clever
Give me a beat, no one could lace it better
Spit so cold I could change the weather
Bitch I’ll be living this way forever
Wait ‘till the game get a taste of Webster

[Hook]
Drinkin’, smokin’, poppin’, rollin’
Fuckin’ ‘till my condom’s broken
Stackin’ chips, and bangin’ chicks
We livin’ life so dangerous, now let’s go!

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Uhh, yeah
Let me go ahead and do it like this now
Sit down, makin' a beat my bitch now
Hit it with that right hook; Chris Brown
Deck down you chick, around the hips
Lean back with a sticky ass pound of piff
This real hip-hop, no counterfeit
Put some drink in your cup; bounce with this
Get loud as shit; T-Rex roar
Put my tape in, and I eject yours
Bangin’ the fuck out of the girl next door
Too smart and I might just check my test scores
Rock with a flow and I rhyme the best
Always on the grind no time to rest
Your girlfriend asked me if I could sign her chest
Then I worked her out like a P90x
I just sign the cheque, and then I make them bills
Shit, and I don’t even got no deal
I know who I am, and I keeps it real
So damn fresh; haven’t cracked the seal
King of the hill; rep with the words
Proved I’m the mother fucking best in the burbs
Step to me then you bound to get served
No entrée dish or a full dessert
I just put in that work; 9 to 5
Jetpack flow; time to fly
No such thing as kind of high
Burn it down all day, that’s what I decide
Yeah, it’s CW
Hear me rollin’ in the whip when we comin’ through
We drinkin’; pop another pill or two
And I be loving my life, bitch, how about you?

[Hook]
Drinkin’, smokin’, poppin’, rollin’
Fuckin’ ‘till my condom’s broken
Stackin’ chips, and bangin’ chicks
We livin’ life so dangerous, now let’s go!



Read Chris Webby's Explanation "Datpiff (Freeverse)"
[Intro]
Ye ye ye ye ye ye ye yeah
Webbys lab..... 2
Na na na na na nana

[Verse 1]
I'm Vladamir and Vitali combined in the body of Rowdy Roddy and Colossus usin' karate
So get to movin' your body, see for you it's a hobby
But I've been dropping shit ever since I could poop on the potty
And it's prolly cause I just spent my whole life gettin' stared at
Weirdo with the raw rap goin' bare back
Can I give a fuck? Hmm, maybe, but I swear that..
You'll never see it like Donald Trump on a prayer mat...
While rockin' a turban and swervin' in a Ford Explorer
Bumpin' some reggaeton and helpin' people cross the border
See I'm just tryna do it for my peoples and supporters
Roll so mother fuckin' deep you'd think I'm breathing underwater
Cause see I'm like the author of this autobiography
They call me an oddity, it ain't my fault cause they'll probably
Pick apart my every lyric like a frog in biology
But I'll keep my stock high enough to stall the economy
As I jog through your property, while they tryin' to run it
Take off flyin' and plummet while Webby climb to the summit
Droppin' fire they love it, it's just a drop in the bucket
Only dude still on the mic without a quality budget
I mean fuck it, I rock crowds and I'm makin' my block proud
Even thought I'm still residing at my mom's house
Wait, wait.. Aren't I supposed to be on now?
Countin' my money from all the people that supported my songs now?
"Calm down Webby, I been bumpin' you on Spotify"
Well thanks for that, like, one thousandth of a dollar, guy
Maybe if you listen enough then I'll get like eighty cents
And be a step closer to gettin' me that Mercedes Benz
Fuck the latest trends, I'll do the opposite
I'mma do me, middle fingers to the politics
And EDM is all I'm hearin' from the college kids
Maybe I'm just gettin' older man, but it's obvious that..

[Hook]
A lot's changed since I first crashed Datpiff
A lot's changed since I first crashed Datpiff
I'm in the laboratory cookin' up a classic
Go and tell em Webby's back bitch
A lot's changed since I first crashed Datpiff
A lot's changed since I first crashed Datpiff
I'm in the laboratory cookin' up a classic
Go and tell em Webby's back bitch

[Verse 2]
(Danger!) I run in screamin' like Mystikal, smoother criminal
Than Micheal mixed with Alien Ant Farm, the pivotal
Multi syllable killer my finger itchin' till triggers pull
Minions in the whip cause I'm mother fucking despicable
I'm sick of all these trivial rappers talkin' material possessions and financial status all up on my stereo
All I ever do is go hard, now it's gettin' physical
Until I'm breathin' hard as Seth Rogen doin' 27 miles on an elliptical
I'm not balling, I'm just lighting the bong till I'm coughing
Jamo poured till I'm crawling
If you steppin' to Chris, I'll leave your head on a stick
Like Ned Stark, I just gotta get a pencil and flip
Cause what I carry and wield, that shit's Valerian steel
And any second I'mma blow, call me Derek Forreal
So it's hickory dickory dock, lick on the tip of my cock
In the conversation I'm the pick of the litter to watch
Don't need a mixer, I don't order my shit on the rocks
All I need's a chalice with some whiskey that's filled to the top
The fuck has happened? One minute people rappin'
The next all I'm hearin' is adlibbing over tracks and
The planet is collapsing, economies are crashin'
And Hillary Clinton is dabbin', so I guess that..

[Hook]
A lot's changed since I first crashed Datpiff
A lot's changed since I first crashed Datpiff
I'm in the laboratory cookin' up a classic
Go and tell em Webby's back bitch
A lot's changed since I first crashed Datpiff
A lot's changed since I first crashed Datpiff
I'm in the laboratory cookin' up a classic
Go and tell em Webby's back bitch



[Hook: Chris Webby & RyattFienix]
Feeling like nobody knows me so I’m pouring out my soul
The game I’m in is lonely but this shit is all I know
Riding in my Chevy down this one way road
Taking it slow, but still I’m losing control
It’s just a day in the life
Things that keep you up awake through the night
Praying that the moves I’m making are right
Tryna find myself a way through the fight
Yeah, it’s just a day in the life

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Came up in the game just a youngin with a mean flow
Here to rock until the clock hits zero
Feel like I’m seeing the world through a peep hole
Stressed out, what you think I’m smoking weed for?
Gotta put one in the air like a free throw, or a G4
All these people doubting me and judging me without knowing me
So what you mean though?
Living life, what you hating on me for?
Oh you mad after finally getting mine
All these years on the grind I’m dropping shit
And now I’m getting shine, breaking records online
But every single one of my accomplishments
Comes at a cost, losing my mind
Always faded off of that pot prescript
Can’t slip up, I don’t got time
Nobody ever built a kind of watch for this
This life it’ll break you down so get ready
Driving down this one way road in my Chevy
Carrying the weight of the world is too heavy
So let me show you people what it’s like being Webby
So doubt me, judge me, hate me, love me
Either fucking way I’m making it
Cause I was made for this, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
See, everyone thinks they know how this life works
But they don’t see the negatives
On tour at least half of the year
Missing holidays and hardly seeing my relatives
They don’t know about the stress of the game
Everyday damn day, shit it got me popping sedatives
Like they fucking jelly beans, will I ever see the end of this?
If I do, shit, will I even remember it?
I don’t know man, all this rapping shit
Got me second guessing everything I had convinced
At the end of the day, fuck it I asked for this
I wouldn’t take it back for shit
I’ma soldier, with a good head on my shoulders
In it til I win it or I get a game over
Feeling like I’m on a roller coaster
Friends turn to foes and my heart grows colder
Drawn to the game like a moth to the flame
Sacrifice it all for the fame
But it’s all worth it when you up on stage and they calling your name
No doubt I’ll be paying the price in the end
But I’m cool now taking a right down the road untraveled
Seatbelt strapped in, this is just another day in the life

[Bridge]
And I’m feeling like I’m losing my mind
This game will lock you up for certain
But I’m doing my time
I keep a smile on my face, I keep my head to the sky
And in the end I know I’ma be alright

[Hook: RyattFienix & Chris Webby]

[Outro]
Yeah, to all my friends and family
To all the fans
Thank you for believing in me, man
We here now



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
She only wears black, with her hair back
Pack of cigarettes up in her bra strap
Got me caught like I stepped in a bear trap
With that witchcraft, 'til I crawl back
When you're next to me, I'm in ecstasy
See the sorceress has got the recipe
Put a hex on me and it's left on me
So cruel with the lack of empathy
With that voodoo when you stick them pins in me, baby
I think I kinda like the injuries mixed with the misery
Trickery, wizardry, an app of witchery that you inflicted me
With the black magic, I'll be comin' back
Like a crack addict with a bad habit
Smokey eyes lookin' back at me, she'll be mad at it but

[Chorus]
What should I do?
They invite me, excite me, their voodoo is taking control
Maybe it's cruel?
I won't fight it, I might even like it the deeper I go
I'm dazed and confused
I'm dazed and confused

[Verse 2: Rittz]
This girl is bad for me but naturally that's what attracted me
We fought, I thought it was just a passin' thing
But after weeks would pass, she got more attached
She's no longer lookin' at us as a fling
I seen it happenin' but can't resist a bitch
Wanted to tell her it's over but the minute that I get the nerve she starts to strip again
It's like a whippin' at a visit with a hypnotist
She use her lips to be manipulative
She told me I was in love, I told her bitch you wish
But truthfully ya'll becomin' a bit obsessed and it concerns me
Now I'm beginnin' to think that she's a wicked witch
I went in a room and all the wicks were lit on candles
In a circle with my picture in the middle
Scribble triple 6's, pentagrams and symbols written on the mirror

[Chorus]
What should I do?
They invite me, excite me, their voodoo is taking control
Maybe it's cruel?
I won't fight it, I might even like it the deeper I go
I'm dazed and confused
I'm dazed and confused

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Baby quick, let me closer
I'm tellin' you this chick is my controller
Tatts all up on her skin with a choker
Come and be the Harley Quinn to my Joker
Somethin' I never seen before
Every single time I hit, I'm fiendin' more
And my hands are always drawn to you (you, you, you)
Even when I'm using Ouija boards and I'm needin' more
'Cause you gotta be some type of venom
Check the toxicology, my curiosity is workin' constantly
She embodies the Sirens from The Odyssey
Until I'm wobbly, losin' my balance and you cast another spell
And then it's happenin' and runnin' through my body like a Pathogen and then I'm back again

[Chorus]
What should I do?
They invite me, excite me, their voodoo is taking control
Maybe it's cruel?
I won't fight it, I might even like it the deeper I go
I'm dazed and confused
I'm dazed and confused



[Intro: Chris Webby & Friend]
"Hey Webby we got some groupies at the door homie"
"Ah, tell them to go somewhere else, I'm not really trying to do that right now"
"So where do you want me to tell them to go, because they have to come here"
"It's like, I've had some bad experiences, okay? It's really, ehh, it's a long story"
"Like bad good experiences?"
"No they were just bad"
"Alright, tell me"
"Alright"
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It all started when I met her, couldn't help but to sweat her
She was bad, so I hit her with that, "Hi, I'm Chris Webster"
Spit a little game, had some drinks when I left her
She handed me a number and suggested that I text her
Weeks went by and I'm scrolling through my holding deck
Saw the name Suzy, so I sent her an emoji text
Kissy face, then I got an, "Oh, hey you"
"What up, yo?" "Nothing, boo, let's get drunk, come through"
Get her address and I GPSed it
Thinking we gon have some drinks and dinner over Netflix
Maybe smoke a joint, then later have some sex with her
Not knowing that she's crazy and obsessive
Got there, she had four cats now I got alarms going
Off in my brain but she was hot so I ignored them
Posters of me on her wall, now my eyes opened
To the fact this bitch is psycho, now that shit is really showing
I had one drink and my eyes got lower
Speech started slurring and my mind got slower
Then I realized I got roofied and I fucking fell over
"Well come here, silly pants, come sit with me on the sofa"
FUCK! This is not good, Chris, hold it together dude!
“Now you’re mine Christian, we’ll be together forever boo”
This is bad! This is bad! I can’t even stand, yo!
Then my vision cut to black like the end of the Sopranos

[Hook]
I met a girl once, her name was Suzy
Little did I know that she already knew me
I got her number and I hollered in a few weeks
Unaware she was a bat shit groupie
Went to her house, tryin’ to get some coochie
Had a drink and I started feelin’ woozy
Didn’t realize, I got roofied
And I just thought we’d get some dinner and a movie

[Verse 2]
Woke up the next day handcuffed to her headboard
Butt-ass naked, hickies everywhere, neck sore
Dick sore, leg sore, this is what I get for trustin’ bitches
When I break free, oh you gon’ get yours
Vision blurry and my memory shitty
In a dark basement, where the fuck is she?
Probably upstairs with her cats watchin’ Sex and the City
I need to break free, come on now Webby, be witty
See my pants on the ground and I grab ‘em with my foot
Kick ‘em up to where my hands are at, let’s give ourselves a look
What do you know, I got an Adderall up in my left pocket
So I popped it, dun-du-dun-du-dun, don’t need a locksmith
Ripped those cuffs off like Kong in captivity
Put my socks on and hear, “No! You can’t friggin’ leave!
You’re all mine!” “Crazy-ass bitch, are you kidding me!”
Then she pulled a steak knife out and tried stickin’ me
I ran around her and I sprinted up the fuckin’ stairs
Still wearin’ only my socks, not even my underwear
She’s chasin’ me, and I can’t remember where the door is
She ran into the kitchen throwin’ silverware, a fork hit my bare dick
Then I took a spoon to my left nut
“You wanna play bitch, okay, well guess what?!”
But I had nothin’ to follow that statement
So I started chargin’ at her full speed, butt naked

[Hook]
I met a girl once, her name was Suzy
Little did I know that she already knew me
I got her number and I hollered in a few weeks
Unaware she was a bat shit groupie
Went to her house, tryin’ to get some coochie
Had a drink and I started feelin’ woozy
Then i  realize, I got roofied
And I just thought we’d get some dinner and a movie

[Verse 3]
I was halfway to her then her cats start attackin’ me
Swipin’ at my penis, jumpin’ on my back, scratchin’ me
Grabbed one by the tail and I swung it like some nun chucks
Ron Jeremy style, beat those pussies the fuck up
“Don’t hurt my fucking cats, I’ll kill you, I really will, yo!”
Then I tackled her ass through a glass window
We fell down, she looked around, and grabbed a sharp glass shard
And stabbed me in the ribs, then she stabbed me in the abs hard
Then she broke away, I started bleedin’ out
Then I seen her runnin’ towards her fuckin’ neighbor’s house
Grabbed a stick up off the lawn and through it hard and ooh she stumbled
Tripped and fell face down in her neighbor’s garden
Caught up to this bitch stepped up in some mud and slipped
Layin’ in the grass, “Someone call 911 quick!”
Look and seen Suzy knocked out in a damn tomato plant
Neighbors callin’ cops and reportin’ a crazy naked man
Drag myself bleedin’ right up to the driveway
Got back in my car and hit top speeds on the highway
Made it to the hospital, bloody, nude, and exhausted
Almost didn’t make it, the doctor just couldn’t call it
But I did, and I never heard from Suzy again
So now I’ll never touch another fuckin’ groupie again
Never be that fuckin’ thirsty for the coochie again
And meet a chick for dinner and a fuckin’ movie again

[Outro]
You have one unheard message
“Hey. It’s uh, Suzy. I know things got kinda weird between us. I haven’t seen you in a year. But uh, I miss you. I’m outside your house right now actually. See you soon”
End of message



[Intro]

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You bite me, and I'll bite back
And I choke you, and you like that
Roll two joints and we light that
And you ain't gotta worry 'bout the price tag
And I ain't gotta ask how many dicks you've sucked
And you ain't gotta ask how many chicks I've fucked
And you ain't trynna have no kids I trust
OK then, let me grip that butt
Slow it down, but she wants it harder
Until we both sweatin' out Molly water
And with the shit I've seen, God bless any man that's got a daughter
'Cuz we are looking for some lovin', boys and girls alike
And I'm no Mr. Perfect but that ass gon' learn tonight
Give it to you how you want
Whether brunette or a blonde
I'm pulling chicks like James Bond
And baby you just turn me on
Like a light switch, can't hide it, 'cuz I read your mind like a psychic
And I know we get each other excited
So why not? Baby girl don't fight it
Don't fight it, and get in my whip
And you ain't gotta worry 'bout the mileage
And we headed back over to my crib
And fuck 'til we close our eyelids, baby...

[Hook: Sample]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you the next you are gone

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
She got that black nail polish
Body like a goddess
What you got, I want it
And I'mma give it back good, I promise
With that cigarette between her lips
Tattoos running down her hips
You got me feeling frisky, baby, come get down with Chris
'Cuz I'm a dirty dog
Yes, I'm a tramp
Girls call me a slut
Dudes call me a champ
A master of persuasion
Girl, you don't stand a chance
Full plate got 'em quickly hoppin' right out their pants
Nibble on your earlobe
How you like it, let me know
Give it to you, nice and slow
Pick up the pace and then I go
Giggitty, Giggitty, Giggitty, Giggitty
Hit it so good you won't wanna get rid of me
Hit it like thowin' a pitch up in Little League
And you'll be face down in that pillow, see
Fucking while sipping my liquor, rolling that piff in a swisher
Baby, I'm big as the dipper, you better get ready 'cuz Webby ain't quick on the trigger
Bang

[Hook: Sample] x2

[Hook: Sample & Chris Webby]
(So let's get dirty)
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
(Yeah, let's get dirty)
They stare at me while I stare at you
(Hop up in my whip and let's get dirty)
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
(Bitch, let's get dirty)
One moment I have you the next you are gone



Yeah, it's Chris Webby
203 where you at? (We right here)
Yeah, it's like that
DJbooth.net (scratch that) exclusive
Let's get it poppin' (scratch that)

Cause every time I get on the mic, and I start reciting, or writing
I'm like a Titan, ain't nobody fuck with that
Poppin' vicodin, and fighting, striking, and biting
Quicker than lightning every time that Webby gets up on the track
Cause you know I done it, I kick it, pun it, and bun it
Step to me and you'll get punished cause I'm always spitting crack
Split a couple dutches, get blunted even though I'm so broke
I had to get fronted the money for the twenty sack
Baby, I'm a killa, with microphones who is realer?
I eat em like quesadillas every time I'm coming through
My skin may be vanilla, but I'm iller than any other spitta
You heard of recently, and that's just how I do
Cause you know I rap it, cause havoc over the Atlas
Someone needs to open my brain up and tighten up the screws
Talent, yes I have it, I'm magic, puff it and pass it
Cause I'm spittin' on the mic until my face is fully blue
Pick it up and drop it, I rock it no one can stop it
I pop it, lock it, no one can ever copy what he does
Rock on any topic while coppin' exotic product from the tropics
That will leave me a very solid buzz
Cause everyday I'm twistin', it's my mission for Christian
To blow up like nuclear fission when I'm pullin' up the rug
From under your feet while hitting your vision with the rhythm
Kick flipping over you motherfuckers and pulling bud
Cause you know I'm going and steady showin' you that my flowin' is potent
Cause I am always spittin' out the truth
Notoriety growing and white as the ocean
You could try to be boasting but I'll knock you out your boots
Cause you know I do this, making music so fluid
I'm barely lucid but I drop it baby and here is the proof
Cause this is the movement, I'm bruising my competition
While hitting them with the exclusive only for DJ Booth
I'm practically the best, DJBooth.net
So check the context, I'm wrecking these little punks
Don't even break a sweat while I hit them from the right to the left
Grind for my checks, with CDs in the trunk
Music's what I do, til I'm through I'll be true
From my head to my shoes because I'm never the type to stunt
Crack open a brew, have them saying "pee-yew!"
Cause I got that Pepe Le Pew, I'm rolling up the skunk
Baby I'm a villain, George Foreman grilling, whore killing
Everything I'm winning cause Webby could never lose
Until I got a million I'll be spilling my wisdom
Over any track that I'm given, and that's why I am that dude
That every kid in Connecticut's learned to respect
So all you haters hit the deck or you'll be leaving with a bruise
The next white hope, so step or get wrecked
Success is my destiny that I choose



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Let's go!
See it's Webby
The dude who fucked your girl last Summer
And I ain't even asked for her number, bummer
And I ain't even smash with a rubber
So if your kid look like me
Don't even ask motherfucker
Huh, you could be just like Web'
With a bottle in your hand
And a blunt to the head
Adderall (check!), shit I got my meds
But I think the doctor gave me something else instead
See I'm back again
What's happenin'
Real life Billy Madison
And you know that I be rollin' (rollin')
Life of a rockstar
Until I see those flashing lights on the cop car
When I hit it (Woop Woop!) we out
Time to dip, bring a chick to my parent's house
Hit it on the tempurpedic from the back, right there
'Till I hear (Chris) Mom stay the fuck downstairs!

[Hook: Chris Webby]
So put your hands up, and do like me
Fill your cups up, and roll that weed
Sloppy drunk in that VIP
Ever since I had a fake ID
So put your hands up, and do like me
Wash those pills down, and feel that beat
Tat your skin up, and sag those jeans
You could be just like me

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
See it's Webby
The dude who.. ah shit, that was last verse
I'm so high that I'm reading shit backwards
Jedi Master, life of a bachelor
Your girl's like salt (Why?) all up on this cracker
Walk around dizzy, with a cup full of whiskey
The next shot of Jack in front of me looking risky
Think about it quick, then I drink it more quickly
Cause fuck, everybody in the club getting tipsy!
From the booth to the track, I am here
At your frat with a beer, unlatching brassieres (uh)
And I'm feeling like I'll never go to sleep
With all this shit that's in my system
I'll be up for a week
So it's time to party like I do (I do)
Because it's all I know, I don't even try to (try to)
'Till I'm forty-five thinkin how the time flew (time flew)
With a cup of vodka and some ice cubes
Telling them to

[Hook]

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
We smoking
And we be drinking
And we be fucking
All like its nothing
That's all I know
Party, until we black out
And then we pass out
Then wake up like
Fucking let's do it again!
So everybody just

[Hook]



[Hook: Rotimi]
Uh, hahaha, let's go
Yeah yeah (uh), yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah (uh)
Rotimi, Chris Webby (yeah yeah uh)
I'm a do me (yeah yeah uh)
See I'm a do me (yeah yeah uh)

[Hook: Rotimi]
I don't really wanna grind no more cause the stress be killin' me
But I know I gotta reach for the top, don't stop cause I will achieve (will achieve)
I don't wanna be broke no more cause the labels can't recognize dope no more
Ay, ay ay ay ay
I gotta do me, so let me do me, I wanna do me

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
There's been a lot before me, but Webby is next
So it's about to go down, like lesbian sex
With lyricism on a level that my enemies sweat
I'll sit here and freestyle till I get my respect
I'm just a little rascal, leave 'em baffled
No hassle, skin tone white as Eddie Haskell
Webby spit it, you know he did it
Move too fast, no speed limits
Stay blasted, rollin' up a quarter
Poster boy for Attention Deficit Disorder
Jump the racial border, "a white kid rappin"
And he's from the suburbs too? Damn, what happened?"
Smooth as butter, never known to stutter
All about my green, I'm a fuckin' tree hugger
Lyrically, I'm sharper than a fresh box-cutter
That's why I'm gon' make it, word to my godmother

[Hook: Rotimi]
I don't really wanna grind no more cause the stress be killin' me
But I know I gotta reach for the top, don't stop cause I will achieve (will achieve)
I don't wanna be broke no more cause the labels can't recognize dope no more
Ay, ay ay ay ay
I gotta do me, so let me do me, I wanna do me


[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Get down, move when I say so
I'm like Eragon, spit fuego
So tight I could sell it to Billy Mays yo
'Bout to be on top, Player 1 Halo
So what I stay broke, I'll have that money soon
Oh yes, it's comin' soon, haters just stay tuned
I'm a typhoon, you're goin' overboard
Stay high, what the fuck should I be sober for?
Haven't earned yet, but I deserve checks
What other rookie's ill enough to come and serve vets?
No matter how sticky the purp gets
I'll be pullin' stunts like Rob Dyrdek
Has it occurred yet, that I'm dope, murder a track
Bout to take the game over it's as simple as that
And if these damn labels couldn't understand that
Finito, I'm done, press rewind on a track, like that

[Hook: Rotimi]
I don't really wanna grind no more cause the stress be killin' me
But I know I gotta reach for the top, don't stop cause I will achieve (will achieve)
I don't wanna be broke no more cause the labels can't recognize dope no more
Ay, ay ay ay ay
I gotta do me, so let me do me, I wanna do me


I wanna do me
I wanna do me
I wanna do me
I wanna do me
I wanna do me



Ah ha ha, Webby
Time to go get 'em

[Hook: Chris Webby]
I don't care what none of you say
I'mma do shit my way
Been here for a minute and I'm here to stay
Cause I'm just gonna do my thang
Made myself a name all by myself
Fuck a record label, I don't need no help
Actually I do because I'm broke as hell
But I'm just gonna do my thang

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm a suburban white rapper but I make it work
And now I'm comin' out the blue like a baby Smurf
And yes I blaze the Purp, put that L in rotation
And I'll be doin' that till I catch probation
Stop yo hatin', I'm just here lampin'
Spittin' intense but I'm not going campin'
Soon to be the champion, steadily advancin'
Run the fuckin' beat till I'm crampin'
Dancin' around everybody Cause you know that Webby got 'em
Rollin' deeper than Bikini Bottom pick 'em up and drop 'em
I'mma Kamikaze drivin' blowin' up in terms of rhymin'
Hit em' so hard that nobody could revive 'em
Rappin' louder than a siren when I show up in the ambulance
They gone scrape you off the floor, man you'd never stand a chance
Climb that hill like an ant, top speed accelerate
But the top ain't enough for me I'll always elevate
Smokin' that celery, I'm the best flowin'
Leave your chick knocked up call me Seth Rogen
Back Round Two, I done killed 'em with the White Noise
MJ's dead now we need another white boy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I run the game like the banker in Monopoly
Ain't no one on top of me, except the chick sayin' "put your cock in me"
I'm cocky And I'm probably the illest, no modesty
If Em ain't the nicest white boy, then I gotta be
And I don't need a gun, never let the cannon shoot
Jumpin' over mothafuckers, call me Crash Bandicoot
And it's true, I'll knock you outta your socks and your boots
Eat you like an animal, I'll put 'em in a sandwich dude
Damage you when I put it on wax man
A dirty mothafucker, I just hopped out the trash can
And pussy?, I'm gettin' that fam
My dick's been in more holes than my brain's got in a CAT Scan
And battle me son? you don't really want it
Comin' back with my shield or I'm coming back on it
A Spartan to the heart, I will knock you unconscious
Flyer than a pilot, but no relation to Pontius
A toxic avenger, Into the Twilight Zone bro and I'm comin' back never
Music's runnin' through my veins
Webby is a beast and I do my thang

[Hook]

[Bridge: Chris Webby]

I am who I am and nobody can change it
And I'll keep doin' me till I get myself famous
A pocket full of change for the day I am anxious
And make myself money off a mastery of language
The portrait's been painted
So bitch, better back off
Pick up the mic and kill it because I'm that raw
And the next person to compare me to Ash Roth
Is getting every feature on their fuckin' face smacked off

[Hook X2]



[Intro: Chris Webby]
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Dopamine, dopamine
That I'm on, that I want
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Dopamine, dopamine

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
See dopamine is what your brain is makin' when your feelin' happy
So, if your tryna' feel what I'm feelin' then yo get at me
And me? I get me fix from all sorts of shit
Every night a glass of milk with some Oreo's I can dip
Fresh pot of mom's sauce, macaroni, meatballs
That smell of Sour Diesel when I open up the jar
Break it up and rollin' somethin', breakin' off a ho I'm fuckin'
Pop a little ecstasy and get that serotonin pumpin'
Goin' commando in a pair of sweats
Reruns of Sopranos up on my TV set
And that dopamine be flowin' on stage
Feel it every time that shit is goin' my way
It's chillin' with your best homies
The spittin' game, it's gettin' laid and it's that after sex bogie
Any time you feelin' good, it's what your brain produces
So my fans will get their fix every time they bumpin' my music

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine
If you wanna feel it too, then all you gotta do is roll with me
And everything is how it's supposed to be
And that's the shit that I'm on, that's the shit that I want
Whether I get it from hittin' pussy or rippin' a bong
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
That bamma weed you smokin', ain't fuckin' with the OG
I hit it till I'm coughing, I hit it often
I'm like a Power Ranger the way I'm mighty morphing
Into a rocket ship, that's taking off into space as I get lost
Thanks to stimulating endorphins, brings me closer to the coffin
Walk on the edge because I know the ledge
I wake up when they go to bed
Got these cowards runnin', I'm bounty huntin' like I'm Boba Fett
Life is like a drug, we born addicted like crack babies
Tryin' ta' get that fix, you gonna hurt your back, like the Bag Lady
Now why do I expose these niggas'? I got to
These niggas' heads bigger than yakoo, it's not cool
Lyrical warnings, gettin' as gory as biblical stories, you  ignoring the allegories
Tryin' to feel good; it's Aleister Crowley
Rush of that adrenaline is my medicine
My fuel is my kerosene
You ever live the life of a heretic?
That, dopamine, from the smoke the coke the lean, is temporary when your third eye ain't opening

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
I'm just tryna' get my fix

[Verse 3: Grafh]
Bitch on my lap, gyratin'
Loud so loud, my lungs vibratin'
High as a bitch I'm up skyscappin'
Annihilatin' some kind of Sanaa Lathan
That's the feelin' I feel when I am creatin'
And the fire's escapin', though your fire escape
Until I lie in your basement
Arise in the pavement just to arrive from inside of a spaceship
That fix, I'm suppose to dream
I chase Hennessy with dopamine
This is dope, I mean, I ain't sober
Promethazine in my soda, I'm supposed ta lean
My momma cookin'? Encore
The family members I die for
The two beautiful kids that I stay alive for
Plus Hip-Hop makes me feel alive more
That fix

[Hook: Chris Webby]

[Verse 4: B-Real]
Let me put you down, with some realness
You feelin' loud with me and Webby, rockin on that trill shit
Feelin' bliss, like its that fattest joint you ever hit
Higher than you've ever been, of course you know you're feelin' this
We're the feelin' that you get when you open up your bag of weed waiting for the first hit anxiously
We're the rush; when the Lakers beat the Celtics
The smile on your face when the joint lit, and ya smelled it
We the vibe at the party, when that shit's about to turn up
We the "hell ya", ya thinkin' when the dabs about to burn up
The fist pump, bitch I'm number one, I'm the winna' by the
Toast at the table when we celebrating [?]
Roar of the crowd when ya see something amazing
We're the thrill of victory, we're the felling of elation
It's a presentation and we hope you see
You're in need of that dopamine

[Bridge: Chris Webby]

[Verse 5: Trae Tha Truth]
Yeah, Truth spit game, murda'
Shoulda' been cased on it
Causing panic, 9-11 shoes laced on it
Haters on dick, knowing they woman' face on it
Money long, snakes, givin' a open chase on it
I'm fully sober, my fix is chicks and change
And ridin' lookin' amazing in something so strange
I hit the hood, just to kick it with homies
Knowing they need it for support, everyone left 'em lonely
I do my best to dodge the phoney, cuz' I don't understand them
And I ain't tryin'
I'm the truth and I don't fuck with that lyin'
Stay from beside 'em
Hit the studio to blackout, every track gettin' packed out
Just like somebody woman as soon as I blow her back out
Might just give a laugh as I proceed to knock a track out
And burn off with my speakers in the trunk, who tryna' act out?
Say Watson tell Boogz I'm on my turn up
Get [tightest?] in them [?], meet me at Dreams, we bout to turn up

[Hook: Chris Webby]



[Intro]

Yea, yea. Cause we came to get down right. Yea, yea, yea (clears throat)

[Hook]

Cause we came to get down right, yea
Eyes low from the weed we roll and I'm in my zone
Cause we came to get down right, yea
Ride slow, with the bass up mo', till the speakers blow
Cause we came to get down right
Damn right, sloppy sloppy drunk
And we came to get down right
Damn right, green up in my blunt
This what it sounds like (x2)
I don't know about you, but I came to get down right

[Verse 1]

Three below, cold on the scene when I freak the flow
Full zip lock, got the weed to roll, thick chick with the double d's leaving o-
Ver my center console in my vehicle, unzip my pants, give my jeans a pull
And even though, I put a little MDMA in your mom's martini (she ain't even know it)
We back to rip it, I'm classic, it's past terrific
I'm smashing these whack rappers, and clash with critics
At the same time, I'm rolling up grass and hit it, and drinking liquor till they telling me I'm past the limit
I'm half smashed and half baked, with accur-ate, flow that's so damn hot I'll evaporate
Let me elaborate, I'm with your chick in the back on my lap doing things that her dad would hate, so get

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Webby up next, success on the front steps
Ticking time bomb, someone dial up Funk Flex
Time to set me off bitch, none left when the dust sets
Got em upset, that I do it this big, white kid that'll never give a fuck less
That'll never pass a drug test, cause I came to get down right man, why you up left?
Hutt one, hutt two, let it go yo, Tony Romo with a bag full of homegrown
And my hat down so low, you can't even tell it's me up in the mother fucking photos, yo (yo)
Tell them wait a minute, when I'm waking up fully faded with a naked chick it's
My memory, and uhh, I forgot your name, what is it?
(Are you kidding?) Sorry girl that's the way I'm livin, so get

[Hook]

[Bridge]

(Piano solo played by Remo the Hitmaker)
This is what is sounds like (x3)
Yea

[Hook]



[Intro: Chris Webby]
Yeahh, ha
Y'all gonna think I'm crazy for this one. But...
...I am, Haha, so its all good
Check

[Verse 1]
I'm a drug abuser
Smoking crack out of a hookah
Feeling like my brain just got blasted with a bazooka
Smoking shit greener than King Koopa
Smoked into a stupor
So high that I had to learn air plane maneuvers
Im used to putting in work
Popping so many perks, getting shot wouldn't even hurt
I just can't feel my face
Lost my sense of smell and taste
But shit, I feel great!
Wait, you can try to send me away
They won't let me in
I'll be in rehab, OD-ing on cough medicine
Chugging robitussin till my thoughts amount to nothing
One pill short of a junkie
But fuck it, end of discussion

[Hook: Chris Webby]
I'll try to stop, but they keep me moving
So I guess I'll probably just keep on doing
These fucking drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs. [Hahaha]
My brains not far from ruined
But I just pop a zanny bar and keep on doing
These fucking drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs

[Ha, yeah]

[Verse 2]
I've been burning since prepubescence
So I gotta know the drill
Snorting advil through a 20 dollar bill
Outta my mind, thats just straight to the point
Skipped 5th grade D.A.R.E. class to blaze up a joint
Poppin', rollin', and blowin', Shit, till I'm quite buzzed
Lightyear, right here, even fresher than I was
Damn it, I like drugs
I'll be popping G ladies until I'm at least eighty
And still can't see straightly
I stay fucked up, I can't deny it
Drinking like a Pirate, getting higher than a pilot
Bagging up dubs, making middler schoolers buy it
"Its the cool thing to do, Trust me man you gotta try it!"

[Hook]

[I've lost my mind]

[Verse 3]
I'll roll a dime, I'll blow a line, popping X till the fluid in my spines missing
More official than most pretenders
Known to light up at night like motion sensors
Acid tabs on my tongue, till I stare at the sun
And see more than one, at that point, I'm done
My minds on the run, but I'm rapping hot
Blasting off like an astronaut
Watch
My brains fucking corroded from blowing loads of the coca
And rolling up so much E that my pupils almost exploded
I know that when its over, and I get a little older
I'll still be a fucking stoner
Forgetting how to be sober

[Hook]

Webby's Lab 2!
CT, what up man, still got those motherfucking bars on deck

[Verse 1]
I'm a killer whale
My frigging tail could tip the scales
And my train of thought is so heavy that I could strip the rails
On dark nights, you ain't catching me with Christian Bale
I'm a Tom Hardy and Ledger up in the city jail
Fuck bail, I'm already down in hell and chilling
Raise hell and sinnin'
Not counting on the day that I meet God and get to hang around in heaven with him
So when I'm Grammy winning, giving acceptance speeches
I ain't sharing the credit with him
Machete gripping
And Redy Whipping, up in my Chevy ripping
From Connecticut to your television, you better listen
Cause the flow's so vicious
I'm superhuman all they are is superstitious
So watch yourself bitches
Cause I be so malicious, vicious
So stay the mother fuck up out my business
I roll up and hit this now I am so lit
It is clear I'm on grass like a picnic
And you know we blunt sparking
Eyes lower than Ben Carson's
Space Jam ballin', I am Marvin the Martian
Pardon, I heat it up like methane and carbon
But I'm going green, solar panels in my garden
I'm committing arson when I drop my project
And I'ma burn your house down with the shit I drop next
Connecticut to the prime meridian listen in
I'm up in every classroom, home and condominium
And I cause a racket bitch, and I'm not talking Wimbeldon
I get it in
That's why they seeing Web like they looking between the toes of an amphibian, I'm brilliant
These other rappers talk but we ain't buying it
Like they selling bottled tap water from Flint Michigan
Bitches I'm on my shit again
Thinking back on life but now it's different
Always evolving, I'm so Darwinian
I'm no simpleton, Webby here to get it in
And I got my Michelin's grippin' the pavement
It's ride or die, bitches let me get an amen
My rap game's godly, pull up with a possé
Rocking the ear flaps like Kyle Broflovski
Webby kamikaze, bonzai watch me
Detonator in my pocket like a Tamagotchi
Swerving like I'm Ozzy, I think it was the molly
I put it down for months but my brain's still foggy
I'll be doing this until the day I go senile
Forget how to write, perform and spit freestyles
I'ma kill shit 'til then with no retrial
Cause I got my lawyer Saul Goodman on the speed-dial
Meanwhile, I'ma swerve like I'm flippin' a bitch
And it's simple as this, on these minimalists
Cannot hang with the bar heavy lyrical shit
When I'm back up in that lab like Kibbles and Bits
Get it? Like retriever? The dog, Labrador?
No? What the fuck, all I'm asking for is you to understand me
And some money for the package store
I need a dollar, can you loan me some Macklemore?
I want them Thrift Shop checks
So I don't care who I piss off next
Clock in, not a shift off yet
It ain't easy trying to live off debt
Put in work but nobody getting rich off sweat
You see I really love rapping bro
But now it's turned into a motherfucking fashion show
They wearing skirts and flip flops, what the fuck he doing?
With pants so tight, you see the damn buttcheeks through em
I'm East Coast cause my sweats in Timbos
A scruffy ass face, cigarette, and brim low
With a sexy bimbo, big breasted nympho
Giving head in a rented limo
So check your info
The game looking real concerned
Cause when I'm on, I'ma steal your turn
I'm like Senator Sanders mixed with a fucking Charmander
So, either way you gonna feel the burn



[Verse 1]
I'm just trynna get my vibe right, trynna live that highlight
Twenty-twenty eyesight, focused on those five nights
If they ain't feeling it fuck it at least I tried right?
But at least I caught a little tan up on this lime light
At least I made through the game and got my soul intact
At least I made it out my motherfucking cul-de-sac
I started with a shitty hand but never folded back
Eyes on the roll, with no intentions on going back
Sticking to my guns like they bayonets up on this civil war
Kept it independent now the game is in a figure four
Cooking up this music leaving lyrics on a kitchen floor
Now I got the life that I was always wishing for
Let them hate this, 2015, now I'm on your little sister's playlist

[Bridge]
And it makes sense, I put it working for years
Now I'm crusing with no brakes in the path of greatness like

[Chorus]
Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh, I be feeling like
Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh, Y'all be feeling like
Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh, We all be feeling like
Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh

[Verse 2]
Vibe is so authentic everybody's pressing rewind
Flow is anabolic Webby never spit a weak rhyme
And they all gon' see I'm, higher than the tree line
Chill up in a cannabi' while throwing up a peace sign
Living like a hippie, what's the matter with that?
Nomadic habits ain't no telling where I'm travelling at
See this shit it ain't no average rap
Now I got the ball up in my court and I won't give it back till it's flat
Ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya, I gotta represent
They know where I'm from from the second that I been stepping in
So let me get it in, check over my head and you gon' see a light bulb, bulb-bulb, Thomas Edison!
Time to take this! Cause victory is in my grass, I can motherfucking taste it!

[Bridge]
And it makes sense, I put it working for years
Now I'm crusing with no brakes in the path of greatness like

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm just trynna keep my head right, on this path that I must go (that I must go)
Only got one head light, as I travel on that road (travel on that road)
Everybody better recognize step aside and just watch the show (just watch the show)
And now we all be feeling live, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh!

[Chorus]

Yama! Pass the g my son!



[Intro]
Say that's fer sher
And that's fer sher
That's fer sher
That's fer sher

[Hook]
I'm a beast (that's fer sher)
Kill a beat (that's fer sher)
Spittin' heat
Cause you know I play for keeps (that's fer sher)
Rap nice (that's fer sher)
Plus I'm white (that's fer sher)
Just give me the mic
I'mma kill it damn right (that's fer sher)

[Verse 1]
I'm a punch line prodigy
Dope? Yo, I gotta be
Spit it and flip it and get 'em jumpin' like a wallaby
But I ain't no Rocko's Modern Life
Still these kids are watching me
Sicker than pathology
I'll vomit on you, probably
Keep rhythm like Tommy Lee
Now tell me who's stopping me?
So everybody stand up, get them hands up like a robbery
I'm a hot commodity, bangin' bitches condom free
Chuggin' bottles till I'm more fucked up than the economy
Mic check, one two, one two three four five six seven eight nine
I generate rhymes
I don't live in state lines
Spit so sharp I can penetrate spines
I rap fer sher
With a bag of the herb, yes sir
Observing actual words, and I rap from the curb
To my pad in the burbs
I'm a bull moving up from the back of the herd

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Said that's fer sher
When I come and show up right at your door
Smack your jaw, got you drinkin' dinner through a plastic straw
Rap it raw, speaking hard
Caption, just put me in charge
I'mma treat 'em like astronomers, they'll be seeing stars
A rap flower, take your chick and bend her back over
Cause I hit more pussy than abusive cat owners
Never catch my ass sober, I'm always passed out
And yeah your girl's a dime, well mine's a half ounce
I hit a track, bounce, rip it when I speak slow
I'm just a wild boy, you could call me Steve-O with a mean flow
Rockin' my jeans low, reppin' the burbs to the fullest
That's where I be, bro
Cause I'm a dog, I shop at Petco
See? I'm just a crazy ass white boy S-O-B
I could murder rock n' roll to a techno beat
With a weed sack stickier than a gecko's feet
Gee, girlies can't help themselves lookin' at the kid
Cause I'm so damn hot they gotta put me in the fridge
You heard, that's my word
Chris Webby be the illest mother fucker in the burbs
And yes, that is fer sher

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah
It's Chris Webby
And that's fer sher...



[Intro: Chris Webby]
Yeah
Pretty lights
I'm just tryna do me, you know
Everybody tells me to do this, do that
But I just keep it moving, you know

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
The life I was living is now finally moving
Tryna map out my movements, make a new blueprint
But I got a good feeling now
Touch down, feet leaving the ground, hit 'em with sound
Tryna figure out where my life is headed
Fortune and fame's a step away so I gotta get it
Hope I don't regret it, but I guess we'll see
In the industry tryna do me
C (See) H to the R I S
Gotta try hard I guess
With every bar I let, outta my mouth
I got people to impress
Tryna stay true to me
But at the end of the day I need a check
I can't live at my parents house forever
Broke as fuck, life could be so much better
Everybody tells me that I'm talented and clever
But I still got nothing to show for my endeavors
This is what I live, this is what I breathe
Without hip-hop, there'd be no me
I may have no budget, but fuck it
I don't do it for that, I do it cause I love it
Tryna get the game wrapped up man
It's all I got, no backup plan
These other kids do it for the iTunes cash
I give it to you for free, it's all love like that
And anybody running they mouth saying they nicer
Will shut the fuck up when they step into my Cypher
Dope word writer
On point like the bullet of a sniper
Future looks brighter, still got work to do
Everyday's a grind
Yesterday was theirs, but today is mine
So every time I lay a rhyme, I know this is what I'm meant for, shit'll be fine

[Hook- Chris Webby & Pretty Lights]
Ooh, sometimes I get a good feeling
Yeah, I got a good feeling, you know
Get a feeling, that I never never never never had before
I don't think I ever felt it, but uh
I get a good feeling, yeah
Shit's gonna start going good, you know
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I'm feeling good, what can I say
Get a feeling, that I never never never never had before
Oh no, I get a good feeling yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Just wanna tell you right now
I get a good feeling
For real, I'm feeling lovely
Just wanna tell you right now
I get a good feeling

[Verse 2 - Chris Webby]
Yeah yeah
I know that today is my time
But there's a million other people that's on the same grind
So I gotta separate myself as the best
I gotta hip-hop beat to the heart in my chest
My lungs breathe music, my veins pump melody
That's why I'm so on point mentally
No one is ahead of me, so I know eventually I'll make it
Even if it's not 'till I'm seventy
Rapped for a century, determined to spit
And everything I got in my pocket I'm earning it bitch
It's been a long hard road just to get where I'm at
Court case and some other bullshit don't match
The stress that I feel you don't know about that
Until I tell it to you through all these eloquent raps
Im telling the facts, you don't know Webby like that
I'mma fuck up and drop out with a felony rap
And though I'm not proud let's get that clear
But I've been through a lot of shit
I'm still here, yes I'm still here
Been pedaling for a minute, now it's time to switch gears
Clear skies ahead, I'm an artist to my roots with every god damn line I said
Cruising, and all this will all be worth it dude
Now relax, cause we finally moving like

[Hook - Chris Webby & Pretty Lights]
Ooh, sometimes I get a good feeling
Get a feeling, that I never never never never had before
I get a good feeling, yeah
Just wanna tell you right now
I get a good feeling
Just wanna tell you right now
I get a good feeling



[Intro]
Yeah Shit it sucks growing up man
Shit changes
You lose touch with people
You lose friends along the way
But you just gotta keep going man Yeah

[Verse 1]
Man it sucks growing up, gotta let go of the past
Not every childhood friendship is going to last
People grow up and move on, for better or worse
Always praying for us that it doesn't end in a church
We used to go on L rides like the city's ours
But now we all got real jobs and shitty hours, huh
And those the lucky ones who earn a check
The ones who don't sit at home all day and blow percocets
Cause I've seen a lot of people on the path
And it sucks cause they almost never come back
It's the sad truth to life, it's ruthless, right?
As a kid we never thought that we could lose the fight
Shit we all had big dreams back in middle school
But real life is played by different rules
And reality hurts
So I always keep a bag of the purp
And pray for the best until they put my ass in the dirt, word

[Hook]
Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams

[Verse 2]
For the teenage mothers with a baby to feed
For the kids who think the pill bottle's all that they need
We all hit a rough patch, get back on your feet, we only got one life
And it goes on, but now we're one less
NEV tatted on my bicep, shit
Nick I miss ya man, but I guess that fate just had a different plan
I thought you and me would be kicking it in twenty years
Talking bout our wife and kids over a couple beers
And now you're not here
And it's hard to even say in a song
But shit I've thought about you every fuckin' day you've been gone
A.G. Shawn and Glock we all getting through the pain
But just know that Norwalk ain't gon' ever be the same
You even had faith in me back when we was kids
You said I'd get big back when nobody did
So now I'mma do this rap shit for the both of us now
Cause I know your still up there Holding me down
So brother, save me a spot if something happens to me
Until then, enjoy the show from the balcony seats
I love you man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
For the kids who lost friends and family in the past
For the kids who messed up and want to take it all back
We all hit a rough patch get back on your feet. We only got one life
If you got a dream you gotta get it man
At least try, shit, you may never get a second chance
As a kid we never thought that it could happen to you
For better or worse It's how I'm here rapping to you
Keep in touch with all your homies and your right in the prize
We all slip and fall down push your shit to the side
Only got one life better live while you got it
Cause only one thing's for sure: tomorrow is not promised
Yeah

[Hook]
Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams

[Outro]
And that's it, you know
Life goes on. Got to keep focus
Nicky We all miss ya down here brotha
We'll see you though
Yeah



Yeah, Webby
Never had a friend like me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it’s that big bad wolf, ‘bout to blow your fuckin’ house down
With a quarter pound in my trunk on the south-bound
You can smell me comin’ as I’m whippin’ it around town
Weed so loud that I’m smokin’ in surround sound
Had ‘em hooked since I shook Dat Piff
No one handin’ me the keys, so I took that shit
With Latarian Milton doin’ some hood rat shit
On my hustlin’ flow I’m a whoop that trick
Got Henny in me and rollin’ with plenty bitties
And home town pussy I call it Conneti-Kitty
As animated as Ren & Stimpy, so clever and witty
You’ll need a certain level of intelligence to get me
Gimmie gimmie, everything that you got
Everything in your wallet and that ring with the watch
There really ain’t no coming at the king for the spot
That’s like stepping in the ring with The Rock

[Chorus]
It is what it is and that’s how it’s gon’ be
Oil in my pen, burn it down, low-key
Y’all know me, I hit hard like Apollo Creed
You ain’t never had a friend like me
(You ain’t never had a friend like me)
In it to the end like me
No matter what the end might be
Y’all know me, I hit hard like Apollo Creed
You ain’t never had a friend like me
(You ain’t never had a friend like me)

[Verse 2]
Got a strong bloodline, I was born a leader
People bumpin' my music from here to North Korea
To Argentina, fans be lining up outside my concert
Like the ticket to my show was a court subpoena
Yeah I get it up on it like EMT paramedics
No anaesthetics phonetic, energetic with alphabetics
I’m spreadin’ the fuckin' vibe like a pathogen epidemic
While I’m sippin’ my unleaded and puffin the devil’s lettuce
I’m a menece in my whip, indicia vapin’
Sippin’ whiskey like some sort of liquid dinner replacement
Feel my inner Simba awaken, the prince in the makin’
My idea of vacation is to sit in my basement and write raps
So I’m ‘bout to tell 'em like that
I run my lane take a step or five back
If you forget the rest then just memorize that
‘Cause at any second Webby might snap

[Chorus]
It is what it is and that’s how it’s gon’ be
Oil in my pen, burn it down, low-key
Y’all know me, I hit hard like Apollo Creed
You ain’t never had a friend like me
(You ain’t never had a friend like me)
In it to the end like me
No matter what the end might be
Y’all know me, I hit hard like Apollo Creed
You ain’t never had a friend like me
(You ain’t never had a friend like me)

[Verse 3]
It’s like, I was made up in a lab or somethin'
The way I hit ‘em with these raps in the tracks you bumpin’
They say I sound like I’m Eminem’s rabid cousin
Who’s still on drugs, fuck it, I’m on acid buggin’
I’m pass ’n puffin’ the loud packed passed my limit
I snap and kill it, my syllables are mad explicit
Take my enemies and kill ‘em on a massive skillet
And as for critics, I covered them in gas and lit it
I’m back you bitches (I’m back) and the crown on my head stay
Get on your knees, bow down to your Sensei
(Bow down to your Sensei)
It’s like I’m fuckin’ Christina Ricci the way I put it down on a Wednesday
Yeah, Addam’s family shit
Always on my hustle ‘cause nobody handin’ me shit
All I’ve got is intuition and a plan to get rich
And when I do the fuckin’ planet will flip, yeah

[Chorus]
It is what it is and that’s how it’s gon’ be
Oil in my pen, burn it down, low-key
Y’all know me, I hit hard like Apollo Creed
You ain’t never had a friend like me
(You ain’t never had a friend like me)
In it to the end like me
No matter what the end might be
Y’all know me, I hit hard like Apollo Creed
You ain’t never had a friend like me
(You ain’t never had a friend like me)



[Hook]
Some people say I'm famous, tell me that I made it
Some other people never heard of me at all
Got some people on my dick now, others talking shit now
I'm just in the middle trying to write these songs
So I can make some paper, yeah that would be great sir
I've been doing this shit way too long
Bout to get my just dues, don't like it then fuck you
I'm just doing me, you can all fuck off

[Verse 1]
Check my lyrics up on Rap Genius, I'm a rap genius
Going longer than a fully gassed Prius, bitch I mean it
I've been at this shit for years now, where my millions at?
Got the wheel in my grip, I'm surpassing you backseaters
Til I'm sipping margaritas off the coast of Ibiza
With a bowl full of reefer, eyes low as Khalifa's
And got two lovely senoritas making home-cooked pizza
And anything we need I throw on the Visa, I'm getting there!
Shit this game ain't overnight, at least it wasn't for me
But now I'm varsity and I'm filling the bleachers
Drop a track and now these DJ's bring it back
Just like a golden retriever
Get on the mic and spit your dopest shit, I know the procedure
Yeah, some people got my lyrics tatted on they skin
Some people read every single Tweet that I send
Some other people still be like "who is he?"
But fuck it man, I'ma keep doing me cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm staying high as Buzz Aldrin
Major Tom can hear me coughing
I'm falling out of gravity ("someone help, I think we lost him")
Hit the stage and show these people how I do this shit so often
Got em yelling like they're Paul Revere on horseback outta Boston
You critics can't deny it, shut your mouth and keep it quiet
Now I'm out here getting bread, you'd think I'm on a Subway diet
I do this shit the livest, so yo please don't kill my vibe, bitch
Or I'm setting off a riot in this bitch, don't even try it
I've been working everyday, I think I need a vacation
And your girl been feeling me just like a TSA agent
So even if you haven't heard of me, at least she did
And even though that pisses you off, don't blame me kid!
Some people hate the fact that now I'm on my way
Some people love every fucking word that I say
Some other people still be like "who is he?"
But fuck it man, I'ma keep doing me cause

[Hook]



Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "Full Steam Ahead"
[Hook: Chris Webby]
Peddle down to that floor, till the wheels don't spin no more
See me swervin', I'm fast and furious, hear that engine go roar
Speed is all that I know, buckle up and I go
When the light's not red, full steam ahead, go and pass me the microphone, and we yellin' out
Full steam ahead (full steam ahead)
In a hurry goin' a hundred and thirty until everything outside of my window is blurry, yellin' out out
Full steam ahead (full steam ahead)

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah, got Chloe and Kendall grippin' the head of my member lickin'
And suckin' until I'm bustin' all over they neck and dippin'
Like andale andale, cause I'm speedy with my exit mission
Gone before they even tell I'm missin', my Chevy whippin'
So fuckin' quick your vision can't manage getting recognition
And now your head is spinnin' like I'm practicing exorcism
So when I'm on the mic there ain't no way you could censor Christian
So many words would be cut you'd think your fuckin' antenna's missin'
Like Em and Tech were spittin', so check the rhythm
And bring it back just like the dead were risen with necromism
Because I shock em like they opted for the chair instead of prison
With my crew made up of closely assembled villains
You just a kennel kitten, stepping into a bigger pet division
I'm bred to sic em, so just let me off the leash and I'll effin' kill em
I'm blowin' up like I apprenticed in demolition
And now I'm all up on your television baby lets fuckin' get em
So run run now, go and hit the road jack
Hut one now, ready when I thrown that
Blackin' out on a beat like I'm takin' Prozac
Mixed with a bottle of cognac, call me Bojack
Cause I'm an animal and I'm so animated
Going green, so I'll get a Prius candy painted
Drivin' through your campus waving as the fans awaitin'
Followin' behind me from a cinematic angle till the camera's fadin', what
Buzzin' like I fuckin' suck at operation
Sorry sir I think there's been some minor complications
Vital signs flat line while your body's shakin'
That's when I lose my god damn patience (sir we've lost another one)
On a god damn rampage, leave em with a bandaid, fuck what the man say
Just a renegade getting handshakes, up and down the landscape
Do what I do to the death, get up out my damn way

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Peddle down to that floor, till the wheels don't spin no more
See me swervin', I'm fast and furious, hear that engine go roar
Speed is all that I know, buckle up and I go
When the light's not red, full steam ahead, go and pass me the microphone, and we yellin' out
Full steam ahead (full steam ahead)
In a hurry goin' a hundred and thirty until everything outside of my window is blurry, yellin' out out
Full steam ahead (full steam ahead)

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
Yeah, all gas, no brakes on the pedal
This song sounds like rap mixed with heavy metal
Never settle, flow hot, I been screamin' like a kettle
In the city of the stars, pullin' strings like Geppetto
I saw the path and I went the opposite way
Middle fingers in the air when I respond to a lame
I was findin' my lane, and they defied what I claimed
Anything is possible, I'm just reminding my state
That anybody with a dream and work ethic can get it
All it takes is confidence and persistence
I calculated a plan I envisioned
Became the man in my city, took shots with precision
And now I can't stop with my writtens
My pen bleeds the truth, I every single sentence
Helped kids through addiction with the music I invented
Made a style and a voice, let everybody rent it
Windows tinted in that brand new Range
So when I say you can't see boy I mean what I say
Full steam like I'm cleanin' a tux
Award shows in my Chucks, not givin' a fuck

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Cause we, livin' it up, shit I'm fillin' my cup
I started with the minimum and now I'm triplin' up
I'm never quittin' till I'm sittin' on a million plus
I'm colder than reptilian blood, with a brilliant touch
Up on an instrumental, leave your noggin spinnin' like you Dizzy Devil
Hit the peddle, since I was eleven playing Twisted Metal
Cause the kid is friggin' mental, spittin' till I pop or rip a vessel in my neck while I whip a rental
I'm runnin' up the mileage, so much if I returned it they'd make me buy it
Auto pilot while riding the Iron Giant
Burnin' so much gas that I'm worried about the climate
Sorry for contributin' to the crisis, but I got my..

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Peddle down to that floor, till the wheels don't spin no more
See me swervin', I'm fast and furious, hear that engine go roar
Speed is all that I know, buckle up and I go
When the light's not red, full steam ahead, go and pass me the microphone, and we yellin' out
Full steam ahead (full steam ahead)
In a hurry goin' a hundred and thirty until everything outside of my window is blurry, yellin' out out
Full steam ahead (full steam ahead)



Yeah, I’m just tryna' to get by man, you know
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah

[Hook]
Grind every minute of my day tryna get by
And if I don’t reach the fortune and the fame I can always get high
Rollin’ up the la, la la la, la, la la la, la
La, la, la, la la la
Stay rollin’ up the la, la la la, la, la la la, la
Get high

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Hello, my name’s Christian, steady flame spittin’
Treble, bass, and drum takes out the same system
Liu Kang kickin', Sugar Shane hittin'
Mary Jane twistin’, that’s my main mission
David Blaine magician, vanish into thin air
If they got a beat to spit on, I be in there
Cause I rock skills, and I pop pills
Til I act a jackass, Johnny Knoxville
Burn ‘til my eyes the color of a cardinal
I go all in, never partial
I'm a pure-bread, they’re just part-ill
They make a track, we forget em’ like Sarah Marshall
24/7 never will the grindin’ stop
Explore the internet, light up the FireFox
This isn’t AOL, but I’m livin’ A-OK
Philosophize, think the Socrates and Plato way
Never fade away, this the raw shit
Blueprint, Stan Lee couldn’t draw this
Flow a perfect 10, head-to-toe flawless
Give ‘em a colostomy bag if they try to talk shit
This is Saw Six, there will be no survivors
I drop the dopest fire, they just a broken lighter
I flick my Bic to the tip of the spliff
Sizzlin' piff, how I spit, try to riddle me this
Bitch

[Hook]
Grind every minute of my day tryin’a get by
And if I don’t reach the fortune and the fame I can always get high
Rollin’ up the la, la la la, la, la la la, la
La, la, la, la la la
Stay rollin’ up the la, la la la, la, la la la, la
Get high

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Rockin’ a new shirt, find your chick and do work
Hoppin’ on every step to the top like livin’ like Hubert
I don’t do the jerk, or the rock away
But I got a lot to say in my mind locked away
Since my baptism of rap rhythms and had cats
Back flippin’ to tracks, spittin’ and ad libbin'
While we livin’ let’s enjoy it
On this planet earth before we destroy it
Cause now it seems we can’t avoid it
They talk about 2012, I’m like “oh well”
But between now and then, Webby’s got records to sell
I’ve been at this rap shit too long, too much practice
Hit a lot of road blocks, always moved past it
So twist a j, light up a dub sack
Yeah we love that, THC and blunt wraps
Bust raps spittin’ dirty as a mud flap
Since I was nothin’ but a rug rat
This is the life I’ve chosen, or has it chosen me?
But I’m just tryna be the man that I should hope to be
Another dope MC, out in the open sea
Hopin’ that the sharks ain't approachin’ me
Totally mind in tact, and I don’t do it for the money stacks
Just a head nod and some firm dabs
Runnin' laps tryna stay on track
Just tryna get by, what’s the matter with that, Jack?

[Hook]
Grind every minute of my day tryin’a get by
And if I don’t reach the fortune and the fame I can always get high
Rollin’ up the la, la la la, la, la la la, la
La, la, la, la la la
Stay rollin’ up the la, la la la, la, la la la, la
Get high



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Lemme get my fresh on, next on deck
I just breeze through easy, I haven't stopped yet
People give me daps, it's just a sign of respect
For me doin' my damn thing without breakin' a sweat
Look at me now, I'm doin' it, that's word on my life
Even this bummy ass white boy can clean up nice
Button up on, hat crooked to the right
Don't gotta look in the mirror cause I know that I'm tight, right?
I'm just here to have a hell of a night
And I'm ready to get twisted grab the L and a light
I know this hip hop game just a roll of the dice
But I know that I'm nice, that's why I'm holdin' the mic
Flowin' precise, who ever knew this stoner could write
And spit venom? Get ready for the cobra to strike
The end of the night? Shit it ain't nowhere in sight
So stay rockin' with your boy cause the future look bright

[Hook: Chris Webby]
So we get down, bottles in the air
Dutch full of the kush and my people everywhere
And we get down, swag on high
Windows low, bass bumpin' in the ride
So we get down, ladies looking sexy as hell
You want a good time? Then Webby is well
So we get down, fill another cup
Cause we goin' from now till the sun come up

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
And I get down, like I never wanna get up
I never let up, I keep my head up, dead up
Fed up, but not havin' my bread up
But still I'm goin' all in, bitch, put your bed up
Shred up any track given to me
It ain't hard for all my dogs and my women to see
That I can't wait to be king, Simba's living in me
So I'mma roll with it, Kill 'em all subliminally
Don't even try gettin' at me, it just ain't worth it
Cause I ain't ever seen a mothafucka be perfect
Got my own title and I damn sure earned it
Ain't nothin' I got now I didn't deserve, bitch!
My feet left the surface of Earth cause I'm too fly
And I don't ever have to come down, do I?
Who I, be? W-E-double B-Y, now who fuckin' with me?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: OnCue]
And I get down, like your girl on her knees
And I got it in the car when we shootin' the breeze
I wish I could leave, the snow and the leaves
And see the palm trees, gettin' blown by mamis
And y'all say my dick bigger than Tom Lee
And I'm tryna get a piece, like my name Gandhi
Got my whole state, riding behind me
My back seat big enough so go ahead and sign me
I murder this rap shit, murder this rap shit
No I'm not a thug or stuck in a trap, bitch
Tell all these dudes, "Don't check my tactics"
Webby I got you, you don't gotta ask it
Let's wipe 'em up like a goddamn napkin
Half of these dudes shouldn't even be rapping
See, me and you got a purpose
They should be at Mickey's, flipping our burgers

[Hook]



[Intro:]
Uh, yessir
It's Chris Webby
2-0-3, where you at?
Ha-ha, yeah

[Verse 1: Chris webby]
Get from out of my vicinity, listen see
This is the, dude who be flyer than a Griffin be
Sippin' tea, gettin' my voice right to strike out willingly
Ready for the game, already had my epiphany
Now who could get rid of me, I show no sympathy
When I hit the track I make 'em jump like Jiminy
Cricket, and bitches be bewildered by my wizardry
And opponents be gettin' Michael J. Fox jittery
Can't tell if I'm dreamin', somebody start pinchin' me
How do I keep killin' these critics with my similes
Metaphors, I'm the Megazord, y'all feelin' me
I'll rap from now until you count to infinity
Flow art like Mozart, conducting my symphony
Hold it down on stage with my main man Timothy
Simply a pot-head, I am the epitome
But I am who I am and nobody could reconfigure me
Yeah, you think there was ten of me, the way I crush my enemies
A guaranteed recipe for disaster, come step to me
Generally, you don't even know how potent my venom be
I'm handsome, young and in charge like John Kennedy
There is no discrepancy, I'm illy with my weaponry
I got the front row at the theater, no one's ahead of me
I'm losin' it mentally, but flowin' it deadly
So, who here could measure me, 'cos you know who Webby be
And just know that Webby be, readily rollin' up that heady tree
Smokin til I'm 70, get at me
And I'm spittin' it fatal, on demand like digital cable
Make heads spin like a dreidel
I am able, and mad nice, so bitch you better act right
Cause steppin' to me is like seeing Clay Aiken and Shaq fight
Hit 'em so hard that I'll knock 'em to their past life
Even though I'm white enough to glow in front of black lights
That's right, I am the best you can't mess bro
Nike Kicks, wardrobe fresh from Mark Echo
Let's go, blazin' the shit, got haze in the spliff
Bitch, I'm number one like I'm takin' a piss
But I spit out number two cause what I say is the shit
Bitch, I'm hungry in the game I need a table for six
There's no evasion from this, cause I'mma leave them on the floor dead
Cause y'all are about as hard as an infant's forehead
I run this shit 'til I got sore legs, I need a stretch
Hip-Hop Chea Pet, livin' off of weed and sex
Line 'em all up, I'll knock 'em down, I can beat the best
Now I need a breath, I need a rest

[Outro:]
Ha-ha, that's just how it is baby
It's bars all day, I just drop bars
Whatever hobby, we goin' to the top, baby
Yessir

Get from round me [x4]

Ha



Statik on the beat

[Verse 1]
It's that human dictionary, Webby's always rapping A to Z
Never smart to play with me
The flow is never rated G
My style is indescribable so nobody can label me
Get loose with a bottle of goose
Rollin' an eighth of weed
Step to me, then I'm prepared for war
Cause I'm a ninja, so you know I'm down to carry a sword
In the lead so my competitors stare at the score
While I'll be gettin' high like Chewbacca and Harrison Ford
Immature, yeah, sure, but I spit that heat
Molten lava off the top, baby, Dante's peak
I just tighten up my sneaks and I stomp that beat
Bill the butcher don't even know if you want that beef
I get loose like the crotch of my jeans
So complex when I rap, can't even tell what a lot of it means
But I be gettin' to the top by any possible means
With that audio crack rock I got for the fiend

[Hook]
I get loose in the booth and I'm at it again
So get ready for the show baby, gather your friends
It's that foul mouth white boy back to offend
Everybody that I can, where's my pad and a pen?
I get loose with the flow, never air to my words
CT on my back and I'm reppin' for sure
Anybody and everybody can tell it's my turn
So I'm a show these people why Webby's the best in the burbs

[Verse 2]
I roll the dice like Jumanji, no Robin Williams
But I'll have a pack of animals stampeding through your lobby
I'm the son of Zeus, Webby spit it godly
I'm a good fella, play the role of Tommy
With a couple of Xanies in my system and a klonny
I'll be wallin' out of control, I fuckin' dare you to stop me
I'm edgier than complicated origami
Throwin' fists, I'm the opposite of Gandhi
Never be wack, ahead of the pack, I'm leveling tracks
Et cetera, you step in the ring I'm sending you back
You'll be lucky if you leave and then your head is attached
When I attack the nervous system with these venemous tracks
Stay loose like the laces on my boots
Living proof that hip-hop ain't dead
It evolved to something new
So call the army and bring out the damn tanks
Cause that's all she wrote, Diary of Anne Frank

[Hook]



[Intro: Chris Webby]
Yeah, Chris Webby, Oncue
Sometimes I just wanna go back
Be a kid again ya know, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I wanna go back to bein' a kid
Everything was easier, ya had to just live
I was a little dude, chillin' with my nose runny
Eatin' grilled cheese and watchin' Doug Funny
Havin' play dates, buildin' Legos with my boys
And buyin' kids meals just so I could get the toys
Way before Twitter, Wii and PS3
We used to play capture the flag and hide and seek
Freeze tag with them Velcro kicks on my feet
Or them light-up sneaks, on the bus rollin' deep
Back before I ever smoked weed yet
Used to run a 7-minute mile during recess
Now it takes like 9 just to jog like half of that
Wanna go back to that, kick it in the Cabbage Patch
And that's where you can find me
It's Chris Webby dog and I'm a product of the 90's

[Hook: Oncue]
I'm a go back, I'm a I'm a go back to the very first time
I'm a go back, I'm a I'm a go back when I wrote my first rhyme
I'm a go back, I'm a I'm a go back when I learned this crime
I'm a go back, I'm a I'm a go back and move forward and shine

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Bein' a kid was just plain illa
Chillin' havin battles my action figures
I had every Ninja Turtle and every one of the X-Men
Teddy Ruxpin was my muthafuckin' best friend
Mighty Max and G.I. Joes
Goin' home with grass stains, Mama clean my clothes
Roll with Tamagotchis in my pocket
A holographic Charizard card, I got it
The Megazord dope, kill it with the weapons
The Pink Ranger gave me my very first erection
Lion King was the shit yo, enough said
When Rafiki drew Simba got it tatted on my leg
Way before I knew what an e pill was
I used to eat mad candy just to catch a little buzz
Now who could rock like I could
Time goes on but I'll always love childhood (uh)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Oncue]
Hey big guy, you already said it
No rewindin' tape, no need to edit
Ever since 7 I've been grindin for my lettuce
Cause my mom and poppa told me no one gon' let us
Get it, so sick I need a medic
At age 8 imagined a Murcielago
Comin in with Donatello and Leonardo
Rocked a mask like Zoro, wanted money like lotto
Summers by the beach house, murdered that gelato
Homerun derby had the hoes screamin' "Bravo! "
Now I grew up I'm the man with the hot flow
Don't know no gangstas, bloods, vatos
You can't see me cause it's hazy from the pot smoke
I'm goin' way way back, hey Dad press this record on the 8-track
If you don't let me get 'em I'm a paint my face black
Runnin' in that bitch strapped like "Take that! "

[Hook]



Yeah, Webby
Uh uh

[Hook]

All the right friends in all the wrong places

Everybody knows, everybody knows where we’re goin’
We goin’ we goin’ we goin’ (yeah, we’re goin’ down)

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
We goin’ down, town to town the whole court
East to West side, got fan support
I serve ‘em with the music like a delicatessen
What will I do next, got Connecticut guessin’
Leave a hell of an impression, my words are my weapons
Now that my name’s stretchin’ they startin’ to feel threatened
I’m rowdy, I’m rough around the edges and I’m reckless
Rock mics from New York, Philly to Texas
Eat rappers for breakfast, murder a beat
Got peoples from Florida to Old Orchard Beach
Up north, but of course I show up with a team
Roll deep like E pills on submarines
Flow obscene, half and half, I need cream
So I can add some thickness to the pockets of my jeans
One day I’ll be on that TV screen
But until then I’m chillin’, just livin’ the dream like

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
We goin’ down like a light switch, we on that hype shit
Middle fingers aren’t concerned about politeness
Rip mics righteous, who could not like this
Eagle in the sky while you birds still flightless
Do nothin’ but travel, flowin’ and such
Got girls across the east side blowin’ me up
They all got Chris Webby in the tape deck
Jersey Shore to my mamacita in Great Neck
Sorority girls from Hofstra to Adelphi
Down in L.I. they bumpin’ that Webb Y
And I’ll make sure that they all are pretty
Got a Barbie bitty down in Garden City
I guess I got hoes in different area codes
CT, 203 to 860
And how could I complain about gettin’ laid off of mixtapes
Even though I probably got kids in like six states

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
We goin’ down like the temperature in winter
A skinny white boy inked up, no printer
CT Simba, knock ‘em down yellin’ out “Timber!”
For those who support all of my Ninja
That’s what it is, I’m here to make it pop off
Lyrical hot sauce, too dirty to wash off
I’m a boss with suburban swag
Spittin’ since I had a fuckin’ pet hermit crab
I’m burnin’ bags, turn in a swervin’ cab
To the school of Hard Knocks where I learned to brag
And when we roll up to show our face
Bitch I’m walkin’ in the door like I own the place
Just gimme one mic, I’m the dopest look
How to Be a White Rapper, I wrote the book
And that’s just how it is, and that’s just how it be
So keep doin’ you, everybody lovin’ me

[Hook]

Underclassman, Chris Webby, CT, holla



[Intro]

We so high
'Cos we so high

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah, I'm feeling lovely, please don't judge me
Walking on the wild side, you just got to trust me
Rolling round with hippies, everyday I puff trees
Getting so high there ain't nobody above me
And I'm feeling spectacular chilling at the bar
No need for the mean mugging while they acting hard
I be chilling with the people that are happier
And I don't need the biggest house or the fastest car
Shit I'm me and that's all I'll ever be, son
I don't need no money to shape who I become
I'm my own man, now that's freedom
You getting what you paid for no refunds
But fuck it yo this a good day
Listen when the hook play
Baby, this them positive vibes and what I should say
Is that I'm faded, feeling happy as fuck
Living every single day like it's the Cannabis Cup

[Hook]
Yeah, we smoke and get by
And you know that we so high
And I'm never come down
Yeah, I'm never gonna come down
I'm just tryna have a good day
'Cos we so high
(When they see him in the dope now?)
We don't really got to stop living this way
But I'm gonna have a good day
Yeah, I'm tryna have a good day

[Verse 2: Jitta On The Track]
Man, I'm so high and I can't come down
She said that she single and she wants some fun now
Said that I'm Jitta and she took her tongue out
Tried to say she shy but that weed's so loud
I be out in L.A
Homegrown the team, baby
Tryna fit a whole eighth up inside a leaf, baby
Yo I'm tryna (cuff?) girl, I ain't with police, baby
Jitta On The Track, lumber life's what your seeing, baby
Yeah, I started with a swisher smoke a blunt up in the morning
Man, I'm tryna have a good day but you know I'm steady on it
And I'm all about my paper like a office to the (laws?)
Get to coughing, man, I'm fresh to death to the (?)
I'm stoned on top like a coffin
Stoned in the cold like I'm Austin
Baby, we can kick it like (Kosten?)
White boys saying that I'm awesome
Shit, I'm just tryna smoke weed to be honest

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Feeling great, B
Everything is gravy
I'm just living life, going wherever it takes me
Started from the bottom, now I'm up on phase three
Shit, you know I got them and the crowd be going crazy
I just run in through this war zone
Tryna keep my head low
Think they messing with me, motherfucker, that's a heck no
Check yo, every time I spit I make them sweat yo
You would think they doing hot yoga in a trench coat
I'm just chilling doing my thing
I could give a shit about the money and the fame
All I need some good weed and a bong and a flame
And a little bad bitch that'll scream my name
When I'm laying that pipe like Luigi
Holler when you see me
Cotton mouth criminal, sipping on a Fiji
Coming with that fire they be calling me Khaleesi
I'm just being me I just need to be easy

[Hook]

[Outro]

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah, I love girls, what's the matter with that?
And they like me back as a matter of fact
See em' at the bar, grabbin' a drink, give em' a wink
If she smiles, I'll be over there quick as an eye blinks
And I think you lookin' real sexy, yo
If you wanna hit the dance floor, let me know
I'm already thinkin' bout hittin' it, or lickin' it like licorice
Wishin' the predicament just changed into somethin' intimate
Your style, girl I'm diggin' it
She stay fly, and if she got the fresh kicks on I gotta say "hi"
I be, highly
Skilled with the rhythm, don't try me
Step up in the club, no I.D
Like I don't give a fuck that I'm 19
Find me at the bar doin' work
Lookin' for the girl here with the shortest skirt

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Now go back forth, right left, pull it
Push till you're running out of breath with me
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Back forth, left right, grab it
Tongue goin' at it all night with me
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Stay grindin' on the dance floor

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Screamin' Ay Bay Bay in the club, so make way
Just had a pay day and need vajayjay
Okay? now y'all ain't ready for this
Girl so just stop, take a break real quick
Not smooth or slick but my game's still sick
I'll make Tila Tequila stick to the dick
Listen to this, Hip-hop song soon as I enter
First stop on the list, to the closest bartender
Checking on the list is to find me a chick
After I say what up to my peoples and drink a bit
Takin' shot after shot after shot after shot
If I got money, then why not?
I got lyrics and rhyme hot
I got the hottest bitches on campus on my- what?
Cause it's all about the sex man
Just jump on the dance floor and grind like the X-Games

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Now go back forth, right left
Pull it, push till you're running out of breath with me
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Back forth, left right, grab it
Tongue goin' at it all night with me
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Stay grindin' on the dance floor

[Verse 3: Timothy]
By the time that you step in, I'm two steppin'
I rhyme with perfection, I grind with aggression
I'm from behind on the side in the section
Got it on her mind, but the grind's my profession
If she get blogded, cup a wine for refreshment
On the dance floor, tryin' to find a contestant
So try to find a contestant
What a shame, even if you're blonde, you're a freshman
Three of four options, never nothin' less than
Dimes, you will never find my dimension
Eights and nines and two or three sevens
And if you line 'em up it's booty meet heaven
Couple shots here and there, feelin' invincible
Mami over there and her rear's irresistible
I scored 3, and called it the hat-trick
And transitioned from the dance floor to my mattress

[Outro: Chris Webby]
Just grind with me
Yeah, grind with me
Yeah
Drop it to the floor
Girl, grind with me
Just grind with me
C'mon and grind with me
If you hustle on my rocket
And you grind with me
Now, grind with me
Cmon and grind with me
My sexy women and the bar
Just grind with me
Now grind with me
Get on your grind with me
Who can grind with me?
Now baby grind with me
Yeah
I'm feelin' good
Stay on that grind, baby
Whether you got a bag full of dubs in your pocket
Or a fat ass baggin' all up on your shit
Stay grindin'
Holla



I started off a little guy, baby full of laughter
But due to Darwin’s theory I evolved into a rapper
Flip a couple chapters, this foul mouthed bastard
Is here to get this rap shit mastered
After I talk to you and get to speak what I’m about
Linguistic, twisted diarrhea of the mouth
So hot, drop the mic and I’ll leave the set steamin’
I been the best breathin’, since I was breast feedin’
Presto, I’m back writin’ rhythmic manifestos
So let’s go, I’m meaner than an angry Lou Ferrigno
Flows that’ll get yo hands in the izz-air
Blunt rap, puff that, done that, been there
So tap the keg, let’s get drunker than we’ve ever been
Liquor settin’ in, shit somebody let Webster in
So go and fill yourself another dutch
And put ‘em up, put ‘em up, put ‘em up, put ‘em up

[Hook]
Put your hands up, everybody stand up ‘cause we ain’t leavin’ till they throw us in some handcuffs
So put them hands up up up up up, and keep it goin’ like (hey!)
Put your hands up, roll yourself a gram up, if you ain’t twisted go and fill another damn cup
And put them hands up up up up up, and keep it goin’ like (hey!)

I’m a mix of rhymes with some Nirvana and Sublime
Eric Clapton with the rappin’, Jimi Hendrix in his prime
A little bit of Lennon and Zeppelin up in the mixture
Stumblin’ around on more drugs than Keith Richards
Hard body spitta, overnight deliver
Lyrics sharper than Legolas’s arrows up in the quiver
Liquor by the pitcher, beer by the thirty rack
Droppin’ dirty ass, intelligent wordy raps
So raise your hands to the God damn roof
Sippin’ white grape juice with the eighty-five proof
I’m the truth, go to parties in my birthday suit
And holler at any chick I think’s cute, and to boot
I’m an artist to my roots, and I got the soul
Rollin’ deep, shit I’m showin’ up with Jacques Cousteau
I’m a pro, here to show you what this rappin’s about
So put ‘em up like you have balloons attached to your house

[Hook]

That’s how we do it



[Hook]
Goin down a hard road
Don't know where I've been x2

[Chris webby first verse]
You see I'm going down a hard road
Light speed activate
Moving at a rapid pace
Down whatever path it takes
To the top, the tippy tipidy top
Cause im spittin it hot
With a vicious rhythm to watch
Block to the suburbs
I'm known as a dope rhyme buster
Full of drug references and cuss words
Parents, I'm what you do not want your kids to be
Crazy little bastard on more drugs than Lindsey be
(snnniffff) shit
Back to rehab I suppose thats it
Pneumonia with the flowin cause I spit it that sick
I'm just gettin where im going yo I'll be there in a bit
I'm the shit, pound sign just sayin
So tweet that while my cd's in your Ipod playin
Always got the bar raisin
Gettin pussy like a young Hank Moody at a Californiacation, easy!

[Hook]
Goin down a hard road
Don't know where I've been x2

[Chris webby second verse]
I've been goin down a hard road
Where the fucks easy street
Rappin since salute your shorts, rutgrats, and Pete and Pete
Product of the 90's
Taught me how to rhyme
Grew up listening to Eminem, Jigga and Sublime
My mind absorbed everything
I'm sure that you can tell
Even if along the way I lost alot of brain cells
Oh please, you know I blow trees
And stay slick with the tongue like Yoshi
Rappin and I'm undefeated
Not to sound conceited
But I'm nice
Say it once, theres no need for me to repeat it
Put me on Ripley's I'll make everybody believe it
Hip-Hop I eat, sleep, piss, shit, and breath it
I'm a dragon on the mic
They call me Mushu
Killin any beat ten times better than you do
The days of my competitors are numbered like Suduko
Do it for the burbs baby holla at the Youtube (bitch!)

[Hook] x2
Goin down a hard road
Don't know where I've been

I'm rappin better
Rip up any track forever
Raising anarchy like Jackson Teller
Call me captain clever
Cause Webster is just a genius
Spit it so seemless
Creatine flowin never comin with the weak shit
(urrrrr)
Stay fucked up, chuggin a bottle
Comin from the underground like dinosaur fossils
Shark tooth in the flesh
Where the fucks Little Foot
Writin lyrics twenty four seven I need a bigger book
And I got me some haters in CT
But they mad for one reason, Cause they ain't me
Spell it out W-E and a double B
Don't ask Y cause I'm too damn high to even speak



[Verse 1]
Ayo, I'm here again like Jesus on Easter
Coming full circle like eight pieces of pizza
Only seek to defeat ya, repeatedly beat ya
One two step, and introduce your teeth to my sneakers
And my kick game's strong, you know that of course
Your boy stays fresh, something like an orange in Florida
Or a peach from Georgia, with mad weed
My backpack got more shit in it than Dora the Explorer's
Spit flames and torch ya, get fucking destroyed
I've been spitting since I was a little bundle of joy
But then I spit on a bib now I spit on a beat
When I evolve from a kid to a motherfucking beast
I don't re-invent the wheel, bitch, you know I'm unique
Break a motherfucker's confidence easy as antiques
Better try plan B, cause I'm 'bout my cream
And got your crew flippin' like a fuckin' bob-sled team

[Hook]
I've been here for a minute but I'm back for more
More skill, more power than I had before
That's right, motherfuckers, and I'm here again
That's right, said I'm here again
And you know it's the same Vindictive riding on the beat
Call me the fucking furnace, I'm providing you with heat
That's right, motherfuckers, and I'm here again
That's right, said I'm here again
And it go like that

[Verse 2]
Bitch there's no hurtin' me, call me Hercules
I spit flame, leave you burned in the third degree
This ain't a homeless shelter, but you could get served for free
And after that, guaranteed these bitches heard of me
Pockets fat like they chowing down on burger meat
But ain't cholesterol, they full of that currency
And fucking with my paper, that brings out the worst in me
Fuck a fight, I cause a state of emergency
Ha, cause I'm like Donald and you're just the apprentice
So I got no need for y'all like a fucking appendix
Written rhymes master, freestyle menace
Whether off the top or not, I'll still kill 'em with every sentence
So battling is senseless, my punchlines are endless
The whole East Coast on my MySpace friend list
Something like you've never seen, you'll never forget this
Even after I O.D., word to Jimi Hendrix

[Verse 3]
That-dat, rat-a-tat-tat
I'm just a hitman fulfilling my contract
And I wouldn't dare, bro, you's a peasant, I'm a Pharaoh
Fucked up, walking around drunker than Jack Sparrow
Cruising in a Black Pearl, step to this monster
And I'll rock ya, send you down to Davey Jones Locker
Deep down with lobsters, ha-ha
Officially the illest college rapper and I'm repping for Hofstra
But this straight PG got your moms and your pops worried
While you're bobbing your head, like Night at the Roxbury
Drop furious rhythms directly out your system
Bass booming so loud that it's vibrating your vision
But I'm saying, so listen, my turn taking for spitting
Is the sole reason I'm living, along with weed and women
Sub-Zero couldn't finish me
I'm here again and spilling my blunt guts on the whole industry
Bitch!

[Hook]



[Hook]
So keep on running
Yeah bitches better keep on running
Muh' fuckers out there are scared so keep on running
But you know I'm gonna find you like it's hide n seek

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Webby's off hook like where your house phone at
And I'm bouncing back
Double click and get your mouse attached
High with a pound of grass it's that
CT dude back to spit word game so accurate
Last quit, first start got soldier's heart
Back to spark with a bag of piff
So choke a ho or smack a bitch
I don't give a mother fuck be mad at this
I'll still be right here rapping shit
Sag my pants and I grab my dick
Scandalous, cancerous because the flow to sick can't handle that
Man of myth I can't answer this, but everybody hearing this ran it back
Tracks on tracks on tracks like you pro two sessions stacked
Spittin' it ill with a vision to kill any mother fucker that will step in my path, yea
That's just how webby be flowing, doper than ever
Hoping to sever the heads of my enemies leaving their face on the ground then I tell 'em to hold it together
Sober? never rarely at most hittin that blunt till it's barely a roach
But I'm MVP in the whole north-east pass me the rock and I'll carry it coach
Brag and boast yeah I'm nice but shit you mother fuckers all knew that right?
See was good when I grab that mic
Polar flow, cold as ice

[Hook]
So keep on running
Yeah bitches better keep on running
Muh' fuckers out there are scared so keep on running
But you know I'm gonna find you like it's hide n seek

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Bitch I'm gonna find you like it's hide N seek
Grindin y'all just grind your teeth
Listen to and follow my directions like when Simon speaks
Simon says go fuck yourself
Webb spit a flow that'll be tough as hell in a gun fight with a knife out duckin' shell's like Mario cart so tell
Everybody know that I'm back bitch straight jacket
With a xanex tablet and wash it down with the draino that's in the back of my cabinet
This is maddness no this is sparta who rippin it harder
Pick it apart with my butcher knife herd these pigs to the slaughter
Oh my God let's go retarded politically incorrect with it
So sick that I got 'em puking and spitting up like the exorcist
I'm maximus mixed in with a little sparticus too
And the mic is like my sword that I use for carvin 'em through
So what that means is when I'm in the booth I'm harder than you
So keep on running mother fucker cause I'm charging for you
You see my time is now, your time is not
All I do is grind a lot, lemme count to ten
Now you should go and find a hiding spot

[Hook]
So keep on running
Yeah bitches better keep on running
Muh' fuckers out there are scared so keep on running
But you know I'm gonna find you like it's hide n seek



Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "High by the Beach"
[Intro]
Recline in your seat, while we ride to the beat
Cause all we wanna do is get high by beach
Get high by the beach, get high by the beach
All we wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high, get high, get high, get high get high, get so high
Get high, get high, get high, get high get high, get so high

[Verse 1]
Maybe it's because I'm selfish, I'm sorry but I can't help it
Cause I'm smoking by the coast and all my worries are neglected
For the moment for a second I'm not tweeting I'm not texting
I'm not calling, I'm not checking so don't bother with leaving a message
I'm not stressing in the least bit 'cos we just let that smoke fly
And I'm living it how I see fit from the sunrise to low tide
I'm so high don't know why my seat belt still on
I've been parked for 40 minutes, yo, damn this weed is strong
See I roll up and give it the flame
Now all of my windows are fogged out
This chronic pumping through my veins
Now all of my worries are crossed out
And I'm gone now like I'm Lana
High by the beach with marijuana
No road map, no ways out, no drama, nada

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high, (X4)

[Verse 2]
Karma's a bitch and life's a beach
Ain't shit sweet, the bottom is deep
The undertow is strong so watch your feet
Don't get carried away by the sea
Submerged under water by Davy Jones' Locker
With shellfish and lobsters and ancient sea monsters
From starboard to port, to weed back on shore
No life jackets needed, my ship stay on course
From Venice to Montauk, and way back to Norwalk
We spark up and then we get high
And you know that I be puffing as much as I can
Hit it and pass it then do it again
Tapping a blunt in my hand
Leaving this ash all over the sand
Don't need me a plan
Don't need me a schedule
'Cos I got medical indica edibles, feeling incredible
Fuck all the chemicals (up in the clouds,)
Extraterrestrial (hearing me now?)
Clear, now ready your ears
Bury your burden, and steady your chairs
No lifeguard on duty, you better beware
The current is currently pulling you where
You pass your pass now pass the swisher
Ask the captain, ask the skipper
Get your scuba mask and grab the flippers
Bitches

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high, (X4)

[Outro]
Recline in your seat, while we ride to the beat
'Cos all we wanna do is get high by beach
Get high by the beach, get high by the beach
All we wanna do is get high by the beach



[Verse One: Bekay]
Bekay
Check it out, check it out yo
The music shit used to be makin' my day
Yeah your dream is ya dream till they take it away
Fuck makin' mistakes, I'm makin' a fan
Makin' a fuckin' army, while you makin' a band
And you could try to desecrate but I'm takin' a stand
On top of Ground Zero with a shank in my hand
And my peeps screamin' out "Fuck this crap!"
I been gave everything I had to this, please give me somethin' back
All your whips and ice, who the hell knows
I'm more happy with some rope chains and some shell toes
I paint pictures, sculptures
A&R's is a bunch of fuckin' vultures, you ruinin' my culture
So while you make your check, pumpin' bullshit
I spit that real shit that could break ya neck
I'm real hip-hop to the death of me
I mean for you this shit is a hobby, but for us it's a destiny

[Hook: Chris Webby]
This is hip hop
I live it I breathe it I walk it I talk it I crave it I need it
Jot lyrics nonstop every day and night
I'd sell my soul for it, name the price
Stay focused, I know that my aim is right
For that one fuckin' shot I would trade my life
Getting' closer to the edge with every page I write
For that one opportunity to blaze the mic

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Rap is my life, always stayin' strapped with a mic
Representin' for all the cats that are actually nice
Which is few, trust son, most of them are fake
Rockin' so many chains they're gettin' scoliosis from the weight
Doin' shows and gettin' paid and it's a fact that they suck
Could get tutored by Pac, still wouldn't be nasty as us
But these the same muthafuckas who be stackin' the bucks
While stuck here in CT like fuck, crack a dutch and it's such
These whack ass rappers think they're tough
With pre-school vocab and a whole lotta luck
I'm determined that I can't lose
Take a lead pipe to Soulja Boy's legs, fuck your dance moves
We've been told we got the talent, the devotion and charisma
We just need an opportunity to prove we can deliver
This hip-hop and I'm dyin' to live it (I live this)
And will do every fuckin' thing in my power to get it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Hip hop, live it breathe it
Walk it talk it, crave it need it
Never lose focus, or get defeated
Keep talkin' that shit, go and get me heated
But I'm rappin', writin', scrappin', fightin'
Spittin', rippin', mic ignitin'
Hold my spot down, stand tall like a titan
And stay strikin' you muthafuckas like lightnin'
Rah !



[BarsTaLoan]
Flying in the car, looking like a star, just like a galaxy
Go so hard like a callus be, uh
Burning more things than calories

KID: I see you homie, I see you. Working, huh?

BarsTaLoan: You feel me? You see me right? I got bars kid, that's what I do

KID: Word? That’s what’s up man



KID: Hold up, you heard of Chris Webby though?

BarsTaLoan: Chris Webby? Man I ain’t worried about Chris Webby, man, I told you. I’m the illest out here in CT, I’m not worried bout no motherfucking ninja turtles, fuck a Mario man, this motherfucker looks like motherfucking Rob Dyrdek and shit, fuck that dude

KID: Funny story, he’s here right now!

BarsTaLoan: Oh word, like here? At this party?

BarsTaLoan: Yo chill, chill, chill, chill…

BarsTaLoan: No

KENNY (in robot voice): I’m ready

BarsTaLoan: What the fuck is that?

[Freestyle: Chris Webby]
Yo, it’s Chris Webby
At this party and shit, motherfucker wants me to rap
I’m about to open an abortion clinic right next to your local church
And go to narcotics anonymous hustling coke and percs
I’m just trying to piss you off, I really hope it works
Go berzerk, I got a dirty mouth, I’ll never hold a curse
Jerking off until my motherfucking shoulder hurts
Even if she vegan she gon swallow when my boner squirts
Help an older lady across the road, “hey can I hold your purse?”
Then kick her in front of a moving bus, “oh no, she’s hurt!”
Shit I’m pretty sure she’s dead but you can check yourself
While I run her wallet and spend all the money at Taco Bell
Anyone this deranged should surely be locked in jail
I’m on the grind but off the rails like an Eric Koston fail
I hit it rapid fire, try to pull out of a vaginal cavity
But busted while I was half inside her
Then I woke up in the morning and had a reminder
That she's getting plan B for breakfast with an apple cider
Someone pass the lighter, I need some weed to breathe in
He’s a demon, dirty mind, sneaky heathen
I don’t need a reason
I’m creeping up like sex offenders with binoculars on a beach in bikini season
You won’t see me leaving, I’m running through that
Stomp you to death then throw my Nike’s back on the shoe rack
Huh I’ma do that, why bother tryna bleach the blood stains out?
Somebody told me orange is the new black
So I scrub my white T til it turns the color copper
And use some Tide detergent and throw it up in the washer
I swear that I'm crazy though, shit you can ask my doctor
Psych, I’m off my rocker like an active grandfather, motherfucker

WEBBY: Your turn, bro

BarsTaLoan: I actually gotta save my voice for my open mic tomorrow, bro

KID: Oh man, get this coward out of here please. Please get this coward out of here...

WEBBY: Oh yeah? That’s cool bro. Seriously. (to party) Who wants to get back to drinking?!?!



[Intro]

[Hook: Rotimi]
You know that I got em baby
You know that I got em baby
And anybody try to block my shine
Take a number and get to the back of the line hey
You know that I got em baby
You know that I got em baby
And anybody that try to step to me
Is gonna quickly get sent away

[Verse 1]
You see a lot of um are hatin' now
Cuz I got my name around
Around me, people sayin' that I'm famous now
Don't be mad, I worked hard for a kid
Wrote a million verses and a multitude of choruses
To get to where I'm sittin', now look at where I'm sittin' at
Kick my J's up with a drink now I'm sittin' back
Lovin' life, feelin' good, tryna keep my head straight
Keep the trunk roarin' that tyrannosaurus rex bass
Been a minute now, now it's do or die
Fuck High school, I went to school high
Graduated with a rap degree, so me reachin' to the top is how it has to be
I'm OE to these poptart daiquiris
Nunchucks in my hand and attack a beat (ha)
I'm on a God damn rampage, money's goin' up and so's the number on the fan page

[Hook: Rotimi]
You know that I got em baby
You know that I got em baby

Take a number and get to the back of the line hey

And anybody that try to step to me

[Verse 2]
I got some very big shoes to fill
Cuz I'm aimin' for the title and I shoot to kill
Got the iTunes in your whole computer filled
Kids be like "Yo dude, Webby's super ill"
Is it frat rap? Or is it backpack?
But all I really care about is where the cash at
I got a dutchie rolled up like a snack wrap
I got a biddie by my side and I'mma wax that
I'll make my competition sweat with no elliptical
The school of new age rap and I'm the principal
Chicken with some waffle fries, flow is unforgivable
Kill it every time I be droppin' a single syllable
Gettin a beat and I'm rappin' it ill and I'm back with a skill you've never seen
Knew that I was meant for this when I was only 17
But I'm livin' good now, movin' onto better dreams
Rapin' every beat I got and making instrumentals scream

[Hook: Rotimi]
You know that I got em baby
You know that I got em baby
And anybody try to block my shine
Take a number and get to the back of the line hey
You know that I got em baby
You know that I got em baby
And anybody that try to step to me
Is gonna quickly get sent away

[Verse 3]
You see I'm hoppin' in the driver seat
Pedal to the floor mat
Ain't no catchin' up to me
VROOOM betta fall back
Raw track after raw track is my résumé
Make my own music while they spittin' over lemonade
Stay messed up with a style to step up
Over the competition while they tryin' to catch up
Haters suck my left nut, cuz if the good die young
I'll be in a body bag by next month
Cuz you know that I Got um baby
Ain't no mother fucker that could stop um baby
So listen to this, I'm killin' the shit
Rippin it sick, I should be sellin' tickets to this
You must've had the game twisted like a licorice stick
If you ain't thinkin I was steppin' in here and killin' the shit
So remember the name maybe take a picture of Chris
Before I burn the house down and leave you sizzlin' BITCH (yeah)

[Hook: Rotimi]
You know that I got em baby
You know that I got em baby
And anybody try to block my shine
Take a number and get to the back of the line hey
You know that I got em baby
You know that I got em baby
And anybody that try to step to me
Is gonna quickly get sent away



[Intro]
Its Chris Webby, yeah
Asher Roth ain't the only college boy on this rapping shit
And I love college too, shit, heh

[Hook 1]
That party last night was awful nuts bro, wish I remembered
But I took a Xany, and shots of Soco so it's whatever
Roll my blunts and pop my E
Now chug that 40 just like me
Pass out at 6, wake up at 3
Then do it again, tonight drinks on me, man I love college

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I love college even more than Asher
Different chick every other night come home plastered
Somehow pass class and twist blunts after
I'm Hofstra's top dog and homecourt rapper
Fitted pointed backwards, spittin' that fire
The shit on campus bitch ask Van Wilder
Don't need a reminder to party everyday
Cause I'm an alcoholic, I remember anyway
I've been drunk since 12, mothafuck a drinkin' age
Walk in a liquor store, take my wallet out to pay
Clerk tellin' me I'm not who I say I be
Even though it says I'm Spanish on my fake ID

[Hook]
That party last night was awful nuts bro, wish I remembered
But I took a Xany and shots of Soco so its whatever
Roll my blunts and pop my E
Now chug that 40 just like me
Pass out at 6, wake up at 3
Then do it again, tonight drinks on me, man I love college
And I love boozin', and I love bitches, I love college

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
They say drugs make you dumb, but I don't think they do
Last semester, I pulled a fuckin' 3.2
When I wakeup's, the only time I'm sober enough
To do homework unless I'm hungover as fuck
And still there ain't even a teacher that can hold me
Go to class blunted, lookin' somethin' like Spicoli
Or I just pull a Ferris Bueler, skip the whole day
I'm just here for the party and I hope that's okay
But there's no way to stop me, this sophomore's a monster
Even though I'll end up doin' 6 years at Hofstra
Sit back, sippin' on a beer with a mic
Knowing these are gonna be the best years of my life, right?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I'm a flip-cup phenomenon, beer pong pro
Hit all 10 in a row with my fuckin' eyes closed
A little bend of the knees and a flick of the wrist
Have you chuggin' every second while I'm sippin' my shit
Dutch Master always full of some ridiculous piff
That got me twisted like a licorice stick
Listen to this, my time is never wasted cause I'm always wasted
I fuckin' love college, that's all I can say kid

[Hook]



[Hook]
I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar is what I need
Well I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar is what I need
Said I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar is what I need
If I share with you my story, would you share your dollar with me

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You see I’m broke, I’m not tryna brag
About money, cars, hoes, jewelry and swag
About to be the first dude with the game in the bag
Who still lives home with his mom and his dad
Screw taking a cab, I’ll save my dough
And get to jogging, yeah my funds are that low
My car’s dented up with some dirty ass rims
My left headlight is duct-taped in
You think I’m joking? I wish
But I’ve also accepted the fact life is a bitch
And I ain’t here to complain
But yo I’m just saying that uh, I’ll take your dollar even if it’s change
Cause I’ve given you nothing but free music
When I do release an album you can buy, please do it
Now there’s a fan base followin’ this character
About to show the world how to make it in America

[Hook]
I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar is what I need
Well I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar is what I need
Said I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar is what I need
If I share with you my story, would you share your dollar with me

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
You see it don’t matter, nationwide everybody heard of me
Cause my wallet still lacks American currency
Dudes be like “Yo you’re not broke son; you’re famous”
Huh, and I’m still unsigned you ignoramus
Boston’s making money like Billy Costigan
While Webby’s in CT grinding for Washingtons
But it’s straight yo, I’m having a great time
And I realize some of these things take time
But I put out more hits than A-Rod
And gotta work a seven-dollar an hour day job
Don’t have the money, but I have the skills
And respect that’s worth more on the real, I’m the real deal
Soon enough I’ll have my fill and pay off all these late lawyer bills
About to have a mil in the stash, for real it’s a fact
Need bills to the max, TiVo bring it back

[Hook]
I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar is what I need
Well I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar is what I need
Said I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar is what I need
If I share with you my story, would you share your dollar with me

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Eh, Webby I got you bro
Pittsburgh in this bitch, Mac Miller
Aight look, I start my name with a capital “M”
You missed the start of the show, but you catchin' the end
MC’s up in my cypher, come and show me love
Say, “Mac look at you kid, you really growin' up”
Before I ever had a video to look at
A bunch of weed and mixtapes fillin' up my book bag
Doing it, feelin' it, keepin' it real
One in a million, needin' a feel
Bringin' the stage, whippin' 'em aways
Kid be livin' in the City of Steel
There’s a hundred billion rappers in the world
Yeah I’m one of many, get this money better understand me
No plan B, bitches no panties
Bunch of hoes tryna Facebook fan me
Platinum record, I get a Grammy
California Kush and parties in Miami
Got the game by the titty, she my nanny
Thumbs up motherfucker, aha

[Hook]
I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar is what I need
Well I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar is what I need
Said I need a dollar, dollar, a dollar is what I need
If I share with you my story, would you share your dollar with me

Throwing competition in the litter box

Get a baby sitter, come and spend the night

Sayin' hello kitty and get up in it right

[Intro]
Yeah, Webby
Ha

[Hook x5]
I'm fresh, I'm fly
So damn high

[Over Chorus Spoken by Chris]
You see I'm fresh but, um
Y'know I'm not like everybody else
Y'know, I don't got a flashy car, I don't got these big chains
But, um, I'm still fresh, y'know

[Verse 1]
I'm fresh, motherfucker, I just hopped up out the tub
Rollin' bud, spittin' on the mic until they pull the plug
Paul Rudd, 'cos to all of these kids I'm like a role model
I teach 'em how to twist a J and chug a whole bottle
I'm a monster, I hope I didn't startle ya
Tryna get my profits in the green like a gardener
Beamer, Benz or Bentley, Webby's only get an Ultima
Paint peeling off the hood, bumper hangin' off the front
Interior smelling like Bogeys and Blunt Dust
But my little dump truck'll ride 'til the sun's up
Ferrari's and Jag's, got all these gettin' chicks wet
But I'm having trouble just tryna pass the admission test
Cigarettes and gas money and I'm over budget
Guess I gotta borrow a 20$ from mom, fuck it
Some people whip in Lamborghini's, going so swiftly
But my pedals on the floor and I'm barely pushin' 50
I'm fresh, ha-ha

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm that skinny white dude who spits every time he's standing out
Only rapper still living in his parent's house
I'm going in as soon as someone turns the beat on
Oh yeah, you're Pitbull's mean, well so's my Bijon
I got probation coming in a month now
Cop's yelling at me 'Webby please put the blunt down!'
Used to work as Leslie's Pool Supplies to bring in dough
And I should probably start again, 'cos goddamn I'm broke
How many other dudes can come in a wreck this shit
And grew up in the burbs of Connecticut
I'ma beast and I'm always doing me
Brain-dead, pot-head with that A.D.D
So try to call me corny (stupid bitch) I still spit it true
And chances are I bang way more chicks than you (true)
I'm doin' shows so who's the idiot now
When I see your mom, little sister and your bitch in the crowd
I'm fresh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Optimus Rhyme, yeah I'm that dude
I got a lot of lyrics, and stupid tattoos
I went to private school, college shirts and doctors
Didn't make honors, sold weed up out my locker
They kicked me out of Hofstra, now all I got is rapping
Can drop a mean verse but can barely do subtraction
Stay true to myself when I'm rhyming and it's clear
The only thing fake about me is the diamond in my ear, I'm here
So dirty I leave your region in fear
It's Chris Webby, not that other seasonal beer
That was a joke, Sam Adams, relax
But I'm keystone nice, the ultimate 30 racks
It's a fact from the burbs never whipping out a gat brother
The only time I pull a hammer is when I'm playing Super Smash Brothers
My bank account's about as low as my gas tank
But I'm fresh, and I'm fly, if you don't believe me ask Banks

[Hook: Chris Webby]
There's a lot of people talking to me, I don't hear nothin'
Pop a pill now I'm rollin', all I hear is the percussion
I'm gone (x5)
Driftin to another world, losing touch with gravity
Losing touch with everything, even my own reality
I'm gone (x7)

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Got my unusual pharmaceuticals, everyone is edible
Barely sensible, but I'm feelin' fuckin' incredible
Like Bruce Banner changin' the standard of bein' lifted
Got another dutchy twisted the size of a fuckin' midget
I rhyme and they fuckin wit' it, so why would I fuckin' quit it?
So I'll tap my blunt ashes on these liars and fuckin' critics
Designed to just be a menace, let me pop a pill and witness
Me defy the laws of physics, tell Newton I really did it
No losin' so let me get it, maneuverin' with the quickness
I'm the reason that my local pharmacy is still in business
I'm the illest like I stepped out the clinic with bad news
Now they see me as more than just a gimmick with tattoos
They hatin' then fuck you, and fuck it yo where's my medicine?
I think I got another doctor's appointment to pencil in
Almost out of Adderall, pop another Ambien
Buckled in on whatever shuttle they try to land me in

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I'll be poppin' G-ladies until I'm at least eighty
Unable to see straightly wherever the E takes me
I'm there, poppin' stars until I'm rollin' insane
Even if the doctor says I'll get a hole in my brain
I got that mental Novocaine, palms sweaty, it's aight though
Molly and some acid tabs, yep! that is the right dose
I'm bad news, you want different? then go to Geico
A drug induced animal posted up with the lights low
Brim to my eyebrows, higher than the sky's clouds
I'm Mike Vick-ing bitches refusing to lie down
Greater than Alexander, searchin' for my crown
Ounces don't do it no more, I gotta buy pounds
Break it down, then I roll it up quick and I light that shit
Ain't nobody messin' with the flow now, betta slow down
You ain't rippin' mics like this
You don't live a life like this, so go and shut your lips
And pass the fuckin' joint man, I need another hit

[Hook]

[Outro]



Damn, man
I'm broke as fuck
Yo Akon
Why don't you throw me a couple bucks
Or some shit, man?
Fuck, ay

I get it in till the sun rise
But all I got's a dollar twenty five
And I don't even gotta ask why
Cause I I I'm so broke
And I know that it sucks ass
Cause I ain't got enough cash
Shit I ain't even got one mother fucking dollar
At all
Cause I'm so broke

Shit
I'm broker than the dropped antique [?]
Haven't had a fucking dollar
In a God damn week
And not having a buck
It straight up sucks
How you gonna pay for weed
When you can't afford the dutch?

How you gonna buy a sandwich
When you can't afford the bun
Cause your bank card keeps saying
Insufficient funds?
Fuck, you think my 98 Altima's fast?
Hell no, but how would I know?
I can't afford the gas

And cigarettes went up
Another dollar last week
If I don't quit now
I'll be living in the street
I know it sounds funny
But this shit's no joke
So but your bottles in the air
If you're straight up broke

I get it in till the sun rise
But all I got's a dollar twenty five
And I don't even gotta ask why
Cause I I I'm so broke
And I know that it sucks ass
Cause I ain't got enough cash
Shit I ain't even got one mother fucking dollar
At all
Cause I'm so broke

Anytime I do have a little money
I'm spending it
That's why I'm spending Spring break
In Connecticut
For me, beaters and sweat pants
Is dressed to kill
Either new clothes
Or pay off the electric bill

But still I rap extra Ill
So yo, don't hate
Unless you're my girl
Bitching how we never go on dates
Thank God I'm good in bed
And a lovable dude
Cause I ain't taking you nowhere
I can't buy myself food

Unless the dollar menu
Gon' be cool with you
If that's the case
I could treat you to a burger or two
And then we'll go back to the crib, babe
You know I get it poppin'
But you are on the pill, right?
I couldn't afford condoms
(Yeah, my bad.)

I get it in till the sun rise
But all I got's a dollar twenty five
And I don't even gotta ask why
Cause I I I'm so broke
And I know that it sucks ass
Cause I ain't got enough cash
Shit I ain't even got one mother fucking dollar
At all
Cause I'm so broke

Psh, yeah I'm broke
But fuck it
Yah know?
I'm a keep grindin'
I'm a change that
You already know



[Intro]
I thought I told you I'mma star
Whether with a free or written down bars
No jewelry, piece of shit car but that's just Webby
Bitch and I'mma star

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'mma star bitch, no five points
Just a high white kid rolling up a joint
I run the fucking beat, until I pull my groin
Eating competition like some stake sirloin
All about my coins, like a damn pirate
Fuck with my doubloons bitch, you should never try it
If you don't like it, you're probably just biased
Cause I stay flyer than a helicopter pilot
Phone on silent nobody could reach me
Smoking on that peace pipe we're the fucking TP
Cause I come from CT, hold down 203 C
Hold my nothing special, but I know where all the weed be
Beep beep rolling up knee deep
King of all the suburbs and they need me
No need for a receipt, you gon' keep me
Caveman flow I've been rapping since the B.C
All about my green like the center of a kiwi
Up in outerspace R2D2 C3P
Your girl facebook creeps me cause she wanna meet me
Flow so magic veni vidi vici
No GED kicked out of Hofstra
But I still lay it down on the beat proper
Private school hustler weed up in my dockers
Cause I always stay high on trees like koalas
Give me twenty dollars put it in my wallet
Rowdy on a beat like a motherfucking mosh pit
Oh my gosh it's Webby baby watch it
No holding back when I roll a phat
L up of only bomb shit
I'm the bomb bitch, ecstasy pop it
And then I'm rolling like Otto Rocket
I got it, no hold up I got it
I'm at the summit bitch, you'll never top it
I'm up in here, Webby's always gonna start something
Always coming with the flame like a carved pumpkin
Got your heart thumping and your car bumping
With this music that I'm making, I don't charge nothing
These are all freebies, so don't start man
Cause I'm rolling with more animals than Tarzan
I live in the Bronx zoo so what you gon' do
I am a mongrel and I will chomp you
Varsity rapper never on the side lines
Rhyme fine cause my mind is Einstein times nine
So start understanding my rhymes cause I've been kicking flow
Since the land before time
I'm back up on a beat, did I stutter bitch
Always gonna come with something sick
Anything you did Webby done that shit
I'm the come back kid, you better stand up
That's why the DEA in Nassau wants me handcuffed
You see ya get down and then I land up
Me and my mic are soldiers, the beat commands us
So roll the gram up 'til we're getting superhigh
Y'all are just fake sick like that Ferris Bueller guy
Me I'm the bird flu, do not make me hurt you
Cause I spit it raw bitch uncooked Purdue
I'm a jerk dude and I will burn you
When the moon is up a werewolf is what I turn to
I'm that rapper you should call, look
Always chasing after tail like a dog
Woof , paws, hook-line, hit 'em with the sinker
Then skate away bitch, call me Andy "Brink" Brinker

[Outro]
I'mma star bitch
Well at least in CT
Haha
Oh shit where that joint at
Feeling right
You know, just droppin' bars
It's what I do
Holla



Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "Imperfect"
[Hook: Jaye Michelle]
Insecurities and anxiety
Kept internally, trapped inside of me
And I really just don't know why it don't show
On the surface, I'm so imperfect, dealing with the
Insecurity and anxiety
Kept internally and trapped inside of me
Even if I keep it to myself better never let it show
On the surface, I'm imperfect

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Tryna learn to embrace all my imperfections
But the voices in my head got me waking up sweatin'
Alprazolam, point five milligrams in my hand when I'm stressin'
But self medication isn't helpin', second guessing while I'm dealing with depression
Pills to wake up, pills to go to sleep
Habitually, continuously
Chemically imbalanced lookin' in the mirror like this isn't me
And I'm left to wonder who the fuck I am
And my listeners been witness as I try to find myself and trust I can
And that's why I'll always love my fans
Without y'all I'd be off the deep end, every other weekend
But this game is like the coliseum, you'll get taken out the moment that you weaken
People comin' for my neck, like they Boba Fett, and I got a bounty on my head
Givin' me insomnia but when I'm sleepin' all these demons'll surround me in my bed
Now I'm feelin' like there's really no escape
I used to go and roll a J
But even that don't work anymore, they just never seem to go away
Need some novocaine to control the pain
And now these mother fuckers know the name
I thought that'd make it better but it's worse, maybe it's too late to ever hope for change
So I'm sayin'..

[Hook: Jaye Michelle]

Even if I keep it to myself better never let it show

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I've always been too nice and too trusting
And time after time that approach left me with nothing
But some drug problems and a lot of debt
Feel the noose gettin' tighter on my neck
Try to tell myself that I ain't stoppin' yet
But it's gettin' harder tryna calm the stress
I got turned down as a youngster, by every girl I ever liked in class
It's prolly why I talk about the chicks I'm (beep) now when I write my raps
Like some sort of validation of a mechanism of defense
Like I'm not depressed, yea I'm havin' sex
But I'm still alone, and I'm still a mess
Chain smokin' cigarettes by the light post
Cherry glowin' usin' that to light mo'
Breathin' in the chemicals and hold it, whiskey got me loaded, damn I need a life coach
I'm a nice guy, people take advantage of me and my money then they step out
Leave me left out, full of self doubt
Life line's got a low thread count
And after all the years of being taunted
Hated on, not bein' wanted
Bein' thought of, in the wrong light
Now I'm feelin' like I'm bein' haunted
By these demons, I try to leave em
But it's like I'm swimmin' in Epoxy, they always stop me
Try to keep my head above it but the waves are gettin' choppy

Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "Inebriated"
[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been up on cloud nine
So high I could never have down time
The liquor pourin's that brown kind
To the point that I'm not of sound mind
And got the white lines up on the counter top
And got a pound of crops, it's like a flower shop
Right in my house so stop, light up the sour pot
And get high till the ground is not
Under you no more, take your shoes on tour
Up and away till the roof's your floor
Sayin' to yourself I shouldn't do no more
But what's one more? You just chewed up four
Or was it five? Who knew, the effects were dead wrong
And you could really tell your head's gone
With even more psychedelics and medications lined up than an old school Eminem song
I'm feelin' myself, baby I'm feelin' myself, I do not need any help
Unless you want to get that jar full of weed on the shelf and if not then just keep to yourself
Burn till we fillin' up the room with vapors
Smoke right now then I'm boozin' later
Cup is so full that it's leakin' like Ashley Madison's god damn user data
I, light up my doobie till I'm high as Mount Fuji
I, got booze of several flavors mixed into my smoothie
I'm, Christian Belushi with a cruiser full of groupies
I, keep it groovy feelin' loopy cause you know that I am

[Hook: Chris Webby + Jaye Michelle]
So high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
.. Do ya feel me now
Drank a lot of liquor
No chaser makes it quicker
Rolled up twenties on the mirror
But I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated
I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated
I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated
I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated
I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated

[Verse 2]
Now I don't support drug usage
I would never tell my fans that they should do it
But any adult can do whatever they want
And live life how he or she chooses
With that said, I'mma still have my fun
Occasionally when the work gets done
Not like it used to be, takin' two or three
Of whatever I could fit on my tongue
But shit I gotta let loose right?
So sometimes when the mood strikes
We gone buy some drugs, and line em up
And turn into a werewolf in the moon light
And the moon lookin' full tonight
Eyes dilatin' as the beast awakens
Feelin' like I just booked a flight
And we flyin' straight into inebriation
But personally, like currently
I just stick to whiskey and I burn some tree
Unless old habits pop back up but fuck, ain't nobody perfect, see
Everybody got flaws, you me and them too
Weed and them brews, lead to them moves
That you might regret but oh well, even if I wake up seemin' confused
I, light up my bubbler till my body feels like butter
I, got that sticky you gone wanna post on tumblr
I, be gettin' higher than a Michael Jordan jumper
Speakers be kickin' like Thumper I'm up in the club with a blunt and a cup then I light up another I'm

[Hook: Chris Webby + Jaye Michelle]
So high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
.. Do ya feel me now
Drank a lot of liquor
No chaser makes it quicker
Rolled up twenties on the mirror
But I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated
I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated
I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated
I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated
I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated



Yeah, this is for all you shit talkin’ muthafuckas out there
Runnin’ your lip and shit
Cause if you push somebody to that limit
You push that wrong button, you feel me?
Dude bound to just turn around and fuckin’ injure you
Ya know what I mean?

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You’ll get injured, grab around your neck with my hands
And choke out every fuckin’ last breath if I can
God damn, I’m usually mad stoned and friendly
But like anybody there are many sides to Webby
I don’t need a pistol, I’m leavin’ you knocked out
Show up at your mom’s house like, “Bitch whatchu want now?”
My sanity can’t be found, try to step hither
I’ll stab you in the liver with a pair of blunt scissors
Run up with a switch blade, flipped out displayin’
And slit my own throat first to show you I ain’t playin’
With a few beers in me I’m a rowdy muthafucka
So keep talkin’, I love it when you doubt me muthafuka
Cause when I feel aggression I just grab the closest weapon
And beat him in the skull with it until I make his head spin
Couldn’t matter less my skin color or complexion
I’m a nutcase for fuck sake so quit steppin’
You’ll get injured, and that’s just me bein’ truthful
I’m brutal, beat you to death with a pool noodle
You fuckin’ toy poodles can’t step to the fight
Leavin’ him drinkin’ every meal for the rest of his life

[Hook]
You’ll get injured, and nah I ain’t playin’ around
One punch make that ass lay on the ground
If you didn’t know before then I’m sayin’ it now
Yes I’m sayin’ it now, that you’re gonna get injured
And nah I ain’t fuckin’ with you
You can touch me or anyone in my crew
You can just ask anybody, it’s true
If I’m comin’ for you then you’re gonna get injured

[Verse 2: D. Lector]
Feelin’ like I’m wantin’ to kill
Straight ragin’, my boys are like, “Knowledge just chill”
But on the real my pockets are filled with pot and some pills
Ready to leave a muthafucka with some hospital bills
I’m not stoppin’ until, I see you drop and then spill
If the bleedin’ don’t kill you, lack of oxygen will
I’m a doctor, not like Phil, but more like Kevorkian
Get over here, I’ma bout to finish em like Scorpion
Stick my fingers in between your rib cage, force ‘em in
And straight open you up like an accordion
I ain’t tryna’ pretend that I’m the hardest
But all this, I'm a beast talk is just garbage
A light weight, I’m a lean two fifteen
Ruthless, ready to leave a tooth or two missing
I put the heat in ya mouth like a Hooters’ wing
And dunk shot after shot like playin’ hoops with Kareem
I’m rulin' as king, proceed cautious, I eat bosses
CT’s mine tell Rell to leave office
Try to cross me and rest in peace under crosses
Body full of more metal than Kanye’s jaw is

[Hook]



[Intro]

[Verse 1 Chris Webby]
Listen babe is it alright if I spend my night beside you
Cuz this liquor got me feelin' like I maybe really like you
But I'm not the Prince Charming you been waitin' for to find you
I might seem like I'm the one but shit it's only for tonight, boo
I do this on the regular baby it's not despite you
That's just how I live my life and you know it as well as I do
Come on, did you honestly think that Webby would wife you
Shit I got my own personal problems I'm tryna fight through
Kickin' drugs that's easier said than done
And tryna keep my head straight when I be out on a run
On the road doin' shows tryna stack my funds
Got 99 problems and trust me you're not one
So I'm sorry boo but you know I got a fuckin' job to do
My heart is off limits so my dick is all I got for you
Don't get it confused I love bangin' you out
But that's the only time you'll hear love comin' out of my mouth, out

[Hook Nikkiya]
Is it alright if I kick it with you all night
Is it alright
Is it alright
Is it alright if I have to leave at sunrise
Is it alright
Is it alright with you

[Verse 2]
Since we met I been the headlights and baby you were the deer
So caught up in who I was you weren't seein' nothin' clear
But I'm focused on myself and tryna make a career
So just ignore those sweet nothings that I whispered in your ear
'Cause one second I'm in then the next I'm outta town
You'd be foolish if you thought I'd think of settlin' down
Doin's hows and pickin' the hottest girl from the crowd
I'm young and famous yo, of course I get around
At least I keeps it real with you, no need for tellin' lies
So if I break your heart don't ask why
And I know you're catchin' feelings for me I can see it in your eyes
When I got your ankles over my shoulder smackin' your thighs
I gave relationships a couple of tries
And learned it wasn't for me so you just gotta realize
That's why when you text me you never get a reply
We can have fun tonight, but I'm out by sunrise (yeah)

[Hook]

[Outro Dj Drama]
Yeah, Chris Webby
Bars on me, get your bars up
Our bars on full service like a cell phone
Ya'll shit out of service (haha)



[Chorus: Stacey Michelle]
Which ever way the wind blows
I'ma keep my brim low
With these glasses that can shelter my eyes
Feeling like a Sckitzo
From the life I live yo
Now I'm caught between both Jekyll and Hyde
Jekyll and Hyde

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Which ever way the wind blows
They gon' ask me why I change and where did Chris go
A stoned soul away from fame, rocked up in this glass house
With the fucking world watching every movement through the windows
It's a cold world, and it predicts snow
Got me stressed out, sitting with a spliff rolled
Thinking back to when I started as a kid, yo
Blind to the biz, all I knew was how to spit flows
Young teen so damn naive, learning jedi mind tricks with immortal techniques
Eminem's LPs with some F.A.B., X to the Z, Snoopy D.O. double G, D.R.E
Skipping church, staying home alone to scribble down a written verse
Dreaming that one day making music be what I did for work
I follow through with that, but always seem to hit reverse
Like maybe I'm scared of being famous cause it's a gift and curse
No time to be an introvert, cause now I gotta be in front of the camera every fucking where that it follows me
Ain't no alone time, just studio time
Haven't seen my family in weeks, there ain't no time
When the tours booked, then it's road time
Sound check, hotel, then it's show time
Mr. Hyde got Dr. Jekyll playing second fiddle
And now I'm stuck in the middle

[Chorus: Stacey Michelle]
Which ever way the wind blows
I'ma keep my brim low
With these glasses that can shelter my eyes
Feeling like a Sckitzo
From the life I live yo
Now I'm caught between both Jekyll and Hyde
Jekyll and Hyde, Jekyll and Hyde
Forced to be two people, got me losing my mind
Jekyll and Hyde, Jekyll and Hyde
Just tryna' find my way, I'm taking you for a ride
Jekyll and Hyde

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I'm stuck as two people, there's the man behind the mic and the person that I am off stage in real life
The person with the stress that eats away at him at night, drives him crazy, every step along the way has been a fight
With any love, I'm always getting hate, and how would you like having strangers talking shit about you every day?
But I brush it off, won't go get it straight, but that negative energy still affects my day
I'm just trying to make a hard earned living dude, cause of what I do, these people see me from a different view
Sick of all these stupid questions in my interviews, like the motherfucking color of my skin is news
Sick of people thinking that I'm on some gimmick shit, sick of all the comparisons that they hit me with
Like every other white kid spit no different, right? Fuck that, my brain waves are limitless
I'm just a kid tryna' sing his song and by chance other people started singing along
I feel like an old soul in a young man's game, but I'm living Hip Hop and the love ain't changed
Put my life in it when I wrote them tracks, but every piece of me I give you, I don't get back
Now I'm feeling like an unfinished puzzle, bartender gonna pour me a double, yeah

[Chorus: Stacey Michelle]
Which ever way the wind blows
I'ma keep my brim low
With these glasses that can shelter my eyes
Feeling like a Sckitzo
From the life I live yo
Now I'm caught between both Jekyll and Hyde
Jekyll and Hyde, Jekyll and Hyde
Forced to be two people, got me losing my mind
Jekyll and Hyde, Jekyll and Hyde
Just tryna' find my way, I'm taking you for the ride
Jekyll and Hyde

Tell em all like (ha ha ha)
You don't really want it with a guy like me
Na-na-na (ha ha ha)
Your jacket ain't got no stripes like me
Na-na-na (ha ha ha)
You ain't about that life, you don't have that heart
When the cages unlock in Jurassic Park
You might not make it, better play your part
Cause I be like (ha ha ha) [4x]
You might not make it, better play your part
Cause I be like

[Verse 1]
Reptilian from the Cretaceous
I've written the pages of how to make music
From minimum wages to killing these stages
I honestly offer the children a blueprint
How to do this shit, how to do that shit
How to crash Datpiff, how to be in tune with
All of my fans from all over the atlas
You don't respect that then I'ma lose it
See I've been around since the comet crashed
With the velociraptors, no way that I'll give in yet
And that's why I'm feeling myself just like Pee-wee Herman in the back of a cineplex
I've watched other rappers catch fire until they would fall like the ash from my cigarette
While on the flip side I've built up my legacy
Bars on more bars on more bars, I'm a triple threat
Spitting like dilophosauruses, many verses and a lot of choruses
And I've seen a bunny rabbit in a race go fast
But I'm thinking more like the tortoises
Main attraction at Jurassic Park
I'm like a T-Rex mixed with a Mako shark
You better play your part
Cause my brain so sharp
You gon' cut your-damn-self tryna be this smart
See when I brainstorm fill the air with shrapnel
And when I swoop down like a pterodactyl
Show em all why I'm the king up in the castle
And they recognize that anywhere I travel
Anywhere I go to, any state I roll through
I'm still ice cold on the stage, I'll show you
The shit I go through on a daily basis made me who I am, we ain't trading places

Rookies not showing respect to me definitely will be getting me irate
You ain't taking no food off of my plate
Address me as captain, you lightweight
I've been around for a minute now, sit down
Get that ego out of my face
Oh you got you some plays on your Soundcloud?
Bitch, I was popping on Myspace!
I was rapping in the goddamn lunch line
Before it was cool to be doing so
Before I had hair on my nuts I was tearing them up, and I knew I had room to grow
And I still truly know that I am numero motherfuckin' uno and that's indisputable
Treating the studio like it's my cubicle
Since I was nothing but just a young juvenile
Cause I've been stuck underground with the sabertooth tigers, I need me a paleontologist
I've just been puffing my loud with an eighth and a lighter
And seeking to make my accomplishments
Known to the people that follow my steps
From when I first started to rocking with Tech
And a 50 show tour, across the U.S
All that I'm asking you for is respect
I've put in my sweat and I've put in my blood
And some tears have been shed as I've been on my path
Just follow my story and follow my steps
By the giant reptilian tracks
I've survived while I've watched others going extinct and become just a thing of the past
Shit, the fact that I'm still here at all is a show of my skill, it's as simple as that

They stab it with they’re Steely knives (They stabbed it with they're Steely knives)
But they just can’t kill the beast (just can’t kill the beast)

[Hook]
Just can’t kill the, just can’t kill the, just can’t kill the beast
(Yeah, its Chris Webby They can't stop me)
Just can’t kill the, just can’t kill the, just can’t kill the beast
(I work too hard for this shit. Too damn hard)
Just can’t kill the, just can’t kill the, just can’t kill the beast
(Let me tell you bout it real quick.)
They stab it with their Steely knives but they just can’t kill the beast

[Verse 1]
Yeah yeah I could of just been stop by what arisen in the past
Sitting in the county cell only two years back
Waiting on a phone call from my girl or dad or my mother
As they try to gather together all the cash to bail me out
And I'm embarrassed for that cuz it was my stupidity that got this felony rap
And now they had to suffer cuz of me and I'm sorry for that
But now the coast is clear and they ain't never sending me back
I was left with fucking nothing not a dollar to my name
Left with a pen left with a pad left with dream it's all the same
While I'm thinking I was looking at three and half years
Still I never shed a tear I got on the grind with an idea
To be great to make something outta my life and just redeem myself
Enough with all the tough talk and shit Webby be yourself
Work for it everyday put lyrics to these beats now they just can't kill the beast. Bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I was stuck living in my parent's house working a 9 to 5
Waking up for court at the crack of dawn and loosen up my tie
Waiting for my paycheck in the mail even though it was low
How the fuck else could I pay for the studio? Cuz I know
Even back then that I would make it rapping
Its all I ever thought about so I knew that it would happen
It had to be so gradually put my soul in this music shit
If you don't think I worked ever second for it you stupid bitch
I remember performing in ten people show
But still I put my fucking heart in it even though
It seemed I would never make it every one told me I'd never make it
But I had determination and I never let nobody brake it
I was set on being famous I was ready for the anguish
That goes into being something that requires mental patience
I grinded and I grinded so everybody would listen
So while I got your ear I'd like to introduce you to Christian

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Went though a bunch of situations leading me to dead ends
But I kept the microphone with me just like my best friend
After lots of bullshit I sat back home
And said "Fuck it" Im'a do this shit all on my own
Got a strong team behind and we went the independent route
Stepped my lyrics up while my competitors are stepping out
Of my way cuz I'm here to stay paving the way every fucking syllable
ThatI say, I'mma make my way to my dying day Im'a be okay
I've been booed at and taunted and hated through all this
I've kept my fucking head up now it me that they be wanting
I've earned this I worked to fucking hard to tell me otherwise
I've made a fucking movement yo I'm not like all these other guys
I was born for this fuck what all the hater said
Any talk about me being fake has now been laid to rest
Took the long road making it eventually
So fuck a mixtape this is me fulfilling destiny

Mirrors on the ceiling (on the ceiling) the pink champagne on ice (champagne on ice)
And she said, “We are all just prisoners here, (just prisoners here) of our own device (Of our own device)."
In the master’s chambers, (In the master’s chambers) they gather for the feast (they gather for the feast)
They stab it with they’re Steely knives (They stabbed it with they're Steely knives)
But they just can’t kill the beast (just can’t kill the beast)

MASS PRODUCTION



[Intro]
Yo!
Chris Webby
Who else you know is about to go rap over some Lady Gaga?
Yo for real
I go hard

[Verse]
Just dance, dance, hold it down
Didn’t think I’m ill? Well you know it now
What’ll come, around goes around
That’s why I hit ‘em with the dopest sound
Flowin’ now got a dub to twist
And not even Ron Jeremy can fuck with this
Cause I’m fuckin’ sick, so who’s touchin’ Chris?
Treat a chick like an Oreo and double dip
Because I’m white as a glass of milk and I’mma rap until
The sun comes up, Massive skill
What I got ? so I don’t gotta brag I’m ill
But I still do when I’m drunk on a bag of pills
Cause I rap shit hotly, everybody watch me
Cause I love attention and nobody can stop me
Go against me, then I’m like John Gotti
And you will get taken care of like Tamagotchi
So sick that they think I’m a zombie, gee whiz Gaudi
I’m so godly, rollin’ with my homeboy Abi
So you know I’mma do what I gotta do hard body
I’m the shit need a potty
Probably do it all in front of your eyes like Hibachi
Roll the dice like Yahtzee, got more balls than Botchi
I’m rollin’ out top speed, and I’m callin’ out shotty!
No blitz, bitch no this, I’m so sick if you didn’t notice
You don’t know what I been through did you
But I still keep it cooler than an igloo
And I don’t gotta be a big dude
I’m still a Pitbull and you’re a Shih Tzu
So strong I could lift you, pick you
Up and drop you, don’t even need to hit you
Grapple rappers, put ‘em on the ground
Pin ‘em real quick no need for a second round
I was a yellow belt at 6 holdin’ it down
Now takin’ over town by town
Wow, Let me just smash the set
And find me a little bachelorette
And I’mma bring her back to the sac and sex
Well see how the action gets
Then round two if she pasts the test
Spit with a cleverly skilled mixture
Big as the Beverly hills ninja (hiya!)
Rollin’ up the windows, Light the L
Puff puff pass till we gettin' high as hell
Kill ’em with the wordplay nice as well
Will I get signed soon? only time will tell
But I’m kickin’ it for now and I love that
Postin’ up at the crib like a Rugrat
Now where the dutch at, fuck that

[Outro]
I’m ill, Chris Webby bitch
You better remember that damn name
Shit. And I’m out!



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah, yeah
I be killin’ ‘em
Yeah, yeah
I’m killin’ ‘em
Till my bank statement reads twenty-seven million
They said I couldn’t do it so you know I gotta get it done
Acrobatic rappin’ the way that Webby be flippin’ son
Six mixtapes and the fans need more
I hit the fork in the road and took a detour
Fire marshall shuttin’ shows down
Cause I blow up spots like a dalmatian strapped up with C4
Blow minds when they heard the rap
Hustle so many tapes you think I’m servin' crack
Make bass lines sizzle when I burn a track
Only dude who made Datpiff’s server crash
Yo I’m nice better learn the facts
Came a long fuckin’ way, not a chance I’ll be turnin' back
Uh, so you know that I’ma rap check ‘em
When I put my fitted cap back like Ash Ketchum
I beat 'em up, grab an EMT
Think you better then you must be takin’ DMT
Dream on muthafucka I am the MC
Hard body flow, cop my tape at GNC
See, I shut 'em up like they Papa Doc
Cause I got more lines than a Stop and Shop
On the day before Thanksgiving, yeah I drop a lot
Of shit, stealthy in the game like an ocelot
Ha, Mortal Kombat logo tatted on my back
So you know I’m gonna finish him from the moment I attack
I’m a train passenger all I need is a track
To be gettin’ where I’m goin’ and when I do it’s a wrap
So step when I bust, get left in my dust
I’m in it to the finish investin’ my bucks
The best and I just don’t stop, an animal
My manager found me up at Pet Supplies Plus
Plus I be killin’ ‘em consecutively
Without expending any energy, effortlessly
I got a bag full of trees, Chef Boyardee
And a hometown throne in the 203
Motherfuckas know, they better tuck and roll
Cause I’m the Master and Commander of this shit
They call me Russell Crowe
I’ll never love a ho, so I’ll wear a rubber bro
If I have a kid I’ll get disowned by my mother, yo
On another note, nobody can step to me
I think I may have told you already, but with my memory
It’s hard to remember anything after all the ecstasy
But still they can’t touch me like I got a case of Leprosy
I got ‘em askin’ questions like they playin’ Jeopardy
A dope spittin’ white boy
What is Chris Webby, see
They take shit too serious, I’m here to add some levity
Roll a J and take one to the head, John Kennedy
What I’m here to do is pretty fuckin’ clear cut
Even at forty-five with a beer gut
I’ma still get your chick wetter than a tear duct
And make mixtapes that’ll get your ear fucked
Not in Taylor Gang, not a Young Moola
I’m in Webby’s World, I am the one rula
Nerf gun shoota, with a dumb aim
Leavin’ Monica Lewinsky with a cum stain
Untamed, understand the flows
I’m dope, but at this point the fans should know
HBO flow with a Band of Bros
And a chick with an ass fatter then Amber Rose
Heh, I throw ‘em off like a star pitcher
They can’t follow the flow the way the bars hit ya
I’m a bar spitta
Shit, them beatin' me is like seein' Mel Gibson at a Bar Mitzvah

[Outro: Chris Webby]
Yeah, I be killin’ ‘em
Heh, I be killin’ ‘em
Yeah, Hahaha
Yeah, Webby’s Lab, yessir



Read Chris Webby's Explanation "Knocked Down"
[Intro]
We'll be singing, when we're winning
We'll be singing...

[Hook]
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down

[Verse 1]
I get knocked down, but I'mma be back in a minute
Glass full of Guiness till I'm passin' my limit
Shots lined up, throw em back, never sip it
Then my vision goes black and I'm in it
We gon' open that bottle and break it in
Chasin' that Maker's with Jameson
Party when it's Saturday again
But you won't see me on Sunday like mailmen
I'm on my Chumbawamba, clutch a cup of
Vodka shipped in from Mother Russia
Just a bad ass mother fucker
With a bar tab that got me crunchin' numbers
21 and under, this ain't for you
I stay lit drankin' brews and breakin' rules
With straight shots on demand, no Pay Per View
So all I really got to say to you, is..

[Hook]
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down

[Verse 2]
I get knocked down, but I get shit poppin' pronto
.. Pulling up on my Dr. Gonzo
Suit case full with a lot of contro-
Band, my shades on like I'm Johnny Bravo
Grab the liquor get wasted, until we all live in the Matrix
Sippin' my whiskey until I'm like sixty and need me a liver replacement
Really I'm sayin', I guess that sobriety's one of those things I can't do for the life of me
.. I honestly try to be, but bein' sober just gives me anxiety
Knocked down like Apollo Creed, pour four shots and I swallow three
Then I hit a little bit of Colorado tree, and then .. Follow me!

[Bridge]
(Pissing the night away)
This drink is all up in my cup
(Pissing the night away)
Knocked down but I'm gettin' right back up
(Pissing the night away)
And we do not give a fuck
(Pissing the night away)
Knocked down but I'm gettin' right back up

[Hook]
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
We rollin' trees and smokin' la la la la la
Another weed song from me
Burnin' more trees than Cheech Chong
Red and Meth all roll together in the same L
We smoke blunts all day, you can't tell? Hell
I'm stompin' in with my boots on
Rollin' to the diner with my half off coupon
Fuck, I been burnin' since I was newborn
So high flyin' through space with Jimmy Neutron
That's how I do mon, rock the rhythm
You would think I had a mothafuckin' pot prescription
Like the doctor's flippin', my grass stay fresh cut
Sticky icky wet stuff, put it in the next dutch
But last time I had a checkup, the doc said my brain was not fully developed
Fuck, but it just don't matter, I'mma have to roll the next blunt fatter, ha!

[Hook]
La la la la la
Just break it up and smoke that (la la la la la)
Now twist it up and smoke that (la la la la la)
Now light it up and smoke that (la la la la la)
And then you keep on burnin'

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
The way this weed hits your chest, should invest in Kevlar
Chillin' on Saturn, cruisin' in the XR
Everyday I got the best bars
And the best weed same color as Reptar
Yes, we stay lightin' up the purple
In my own entourage, smokin' like Turtle
Fuck all the commercials, they all straight lies
Actin' like I'm gonna kill a mothafucker cause I'm high
The most I'm likely to do is open the fridge
Chill on the couch, and never end up leavin' my crib
Shit, but that's just how I do
Stay high, seein' from my birds eye view
I walk into a room and everybody starts sniffin'
"Like, oh my God, I can guarantee that's Christian"
"It's nine in the morning yo, what the fuck's with him?"
And I'm like, "Chill! I've got a weed addiction", like

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
We lightin' ganja ganja, every day we burn dutchies
And always we stay around more trees than Fern Gully
I earn money, spend on weed, and burn money
Got the dice in my hand, can't take my turn from me
I rip like a beast when I hit the beats
But it's just weed when they say I'm equipped with heat
Please, shit's leavin' you in disbelief
I'm that monster at your door, bitch, trick-or-treat
The way I freestyle, shit, it really baffles me
Cause I'm a pot head, call me Johnny Appleseed
I got a dub and a dutch, let's roll and spark
Til we start to see shit like Joan of Arc
I know I'm smart, I know I'm nice
That's why ya'll can't see me like a poltergeist
Smokin' la la la, give that bowl a light
Grab the bong even tighter than I hold the mic, like

[Hook]

KENNY (in robot voice): Beatbox activating

WEBBY: *coughs*

MARTY (referring to Kenny): Is that coming out of his mouth?

[Freestyle: Chris Webby]
I'm an untrained dog, no collar
Had loose screws since I was a toddler
Yo don't bother
Up in this bitch drinking vodka like water
Do you read me? Roger, I am a monster
All you young buck white kids put the mic down, I am your father
Still be drinking like I did when I was up at Hofstra
Taking more shots than I did playing Contra
Hold up, hold up, hold up, wait
Let me take a sip of water, I don't know if I'm straight
Lost track of all the LIT's that I drank
And I'm feeling like I just might faint
But I lace my sneakers, eat a piece of pizza
And throw another bottle right up on the Visa
Bangin' out those speakers
Going hard in the paint like I fucked Mona Lisa
Where the chronic B?
My short term memory is chronically
Fucked up, cause I burn down constantly
How could I shape up? I forgot geometry
But they gon' learn CT in geography
Cause I got the whole damn world watching me
It's hard to even keep up with it honestly
Let's gettin' it muthafuckin' poppin' B
We're losing brain cells
I don't think I'm leaving this
Motherfucker, 'til somebody takes away my keys and shit
I haven't been trained well, I'm so disobedient
Got that verbal dope, so just holla if you need a fix
Drop a freestyle, daily fire
Lighting up a bong up that'll take me higher
Crazy rhymer, that's known to cross the line like a stereotypical Asian driver
Web so sick that I make 'em nauseous
Go balls out, never play it cautious
Went from a dorm room to rapping to muthafuckers wearing suits in a label office
I'm a beast on the mic with a beatbox flow
Anybody steppin' after he rocks, no
He got flow, I'm an animal, follow my name with an e-i, e-i, e-i-o
Seat ride low when I'm cruising in
With a cup full of brown like Julian
With a trailer park boy and some hooligans
Got bars, yeah kid I got a few of them
It's C Web

MARTY: Mc Donald's, Coca Cola, Chris Webby, in lights... Billboard, Times Square, you'll be holding babies on ad commercials

WEBBY: That's cool. Babies, why babies? I don't understand this

MARTY: You know what, you wanna make money?

WEBBY: I mean...

MARTY: A million dollars

WEBBY: That's cool, I... don't know...

MARTY: Five albums, eight years

WEBBY, WEBBY'S AGENT, KENNY: What? Five albums, damn! Nah nah...

WEBBY: I...

MARTY: So no deal?

WEBBY'S AGENT: Yeah, we're not gonna...

WEBBY: I... I mean, I'm just not so sure...

MARTY: Get out of my office. Leave the pen here too

WEBBY: Damn, alright...

MARTY (from the distance): Lisa, next meeting! And bring me a coffee and my fucking granola bar!



[Chris Webby Talking]
Yeah, we all get to that point in our life ya know
Shit really hits the fan and everything seems like it sucks
But ya know, you always gotta think everything happens for a reason
Ya know what I'm sayin'? Chyeah

[Verse 1:]
Everybody make mistakes, I'm the first to admit it
But once you make a choice you're forced to live with it
Some people never get it till they live it
And then when they live it
There's not a chance that they ever could forget it
You wish that you could switch it
Waitin' on that lawyer visit
Now the old me's dead and gone
Like I had Timberlake to spit it
The way I had been livin' my life just wouldn't cut it
Head always in the clouds with an attitude like "Fuck it"
But that's just immaturity and surely I figured out thoroughly
That that was only hurtin' me
Now I need a purposely
Get my life back on track and leave some things in the past
It's as simple as that, yeah

[Hook:]
Some people say that I'm not worth it
I made mistakes but nobody's perfect
I guess I'll give it a try

I got one last chance to get myself together
I can't lose no more time it's now or never
And I try to remember who I used to be
I got one last chance to get myself together

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes you need to realize you got one last chance
When the outcome of your life rests within a judge's hands
And I'll never understand how one man with a gavel
Can decide if your future is worth being unraveled
Or take away your paddle and send you right down shits creek
For as long as the dude sees fit
See it's a tough ass world that we live in
You could find yourself in prison over one wrong decision
It's difficult to get this shit outta your mind
Wish you could just press rewind, go back in time
But I've accepted that I need to find the bright side
Cause often the dark is the only thing in sight
I'll find that silver lining cause I gotta keep on grindin'
And until I reach the top you know I gotta keep on climbin'
One setback won't stop me
I'm still here breathin'
Believin' that even this shit happened for a reason

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
And I don't wanna be misunderstood (you gotta understand me)
I got to take this chance
And make it into something good, oh (you gotta always find the bright side)
Some people say that I'm not worth it (nah)
Made mistakes but nobody's perfect (nobody)
I guess I'll give it a try (I'm a try, Lord knows I'm a try)

I got one last chance to get myself together
I can't lose no more time it's now or never [2x]
And I try to remember who I used to be
I got one last chance to get myself together

I got one last chance (yeah, I got one last chance)
And so it's all I need, one last chance

[Chris Webby Talking]
Sometimes, you just gotta change everything up
Grow the fuck up, ya know
You can always bounce back
Ha, ha, ha, ha
It's Chris Webby



[Hook]
I be living in the left lane
Passing y'all by
Sun roof rolling back, speakers up high
I be living in the left lane
Closing my eyes, watch the world from the third person inside
I be living in the left lane
Never looking back with my foot up on the gas, ain't got no time to react
I be living in the left lane
Moving too fast, I'm just trying not to crash, it could all end in a flash
When you be living in the left lane

[Verse 1]
Fast money, fast women, fast cars, doing donuts in the back-yard
Middle fingers up like a rap star, telling me I go too hard
Shots all lined up on the God damn bar
With a chick so bad she dropping jaws
And I'm dropping trou and I hit that raw, yeah
Live this way till I lose my mind, me I'm doing fine
Fucking monster call me Frankenstein and Dracula combined
On my grind, in my verbal prime, still Optimus Rhyme
Got Griselda Blanco coke and no one fucking with these lines
Cause uh, all this shit is apart of my job, the parties the woman
The liquor the music, living a life you could only imagine
Put it in words and I give it to you, kids
But I told them, please don't try this at home, you really will lose it
So don't blame me if my listeners do it (let's go)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Let me carefully win, they callin' me Jeremy Lin, never stare at the rim
If you going to give me the rock I'm gonna dribble and carry it in
No comparing to him
Up on the road everyday, chugging a bottle of gin, contacts lens, 20/20
But you can't see them from under my brim, do it again ('gain)
Beast mode, cup full, trees rolled, shit I'm here to rap
And if you're not I'd check that ego, try to keep it peaceful
But if they be coming at me bro
I'm rolling up in a tank, like I got Grand Theft Auto cheat codes
A mix of Mick Jagger and Morrison on tour again
Pushing the fucking limits till I'm in the crematorium
Cause when a star goes out it does so in a blaze of glory
Then Mr. Harry Fraud will just bring the chorus in

[Hook]



[Produced By: Krunkadelic & Ben Billions]

[Verse 1]
I've had some of my best times chillin' at the bar yo
Doing stupid shit, that I won't remember tomorrow
Waking up confused, still wearing my shoes
Thinking back like ''Yoo What the fuck did I do?!''
Nights like this started with a pre-game
Give me an auxiliary chord, now I'm the DJ
Playing what I wanna hear, none of the Pop shit
Give me the Big L, Wu Tang and Pac shit
Drinking till I'm buzzing like my phone's on vibrate
Taking another shot just to clear my mind state
Now im feeling good, never any less
So I'd like to welcome you to Project X
Yeah yeah yeahh
All you need is that 5 dollars for a cup and you can party 'till the sun comes up

[Bridge]
12am: On the way to the house
5am:  We'll be kicking y'all out
6am:  We'll be falling asleep
By 10pm It's on me to do it again

[Hook]
Let's do it again
Let's do it again
Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it again
Let's do it again
Let's do it again
Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it again

[Verse 2]
And I don't wanna push my luck
Cause I'm already so drunk
I just threw my dinner up (But fuck it)
I've been trained to be a weekend warrior
So the puke and rally move is in my wheelhouse, of course sir
Living on the border
There is no other option
Even if the memories we make are all forgotten
I'll be sipping my concoction
I'm mid twenties, drinking like I'm 18 back in high school
Is that a problem?
Na man, this is not a race
Imma have my fun now
And mature at my own pace
Cause for years I've been living this exact same way
I'm like Bill Murray in Groundhogs' day

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's getting late now, late as the night can
Girl under my left arm, bottle in my right hand
Everybody's drunk now, most of them are passed out
Reach into my back pocket and pull a bag out
Then finally the herb come around
Blunt ride back and burn the fuck down
Getting so high, that my contacts dry
Put the visine in my eyes
So go and live your lives, we'll only get to do it once
Have some fun with it yo
Everybody loosing up, go and do some stupid stuff
Isn't that what's life about?
Man I'm having fun and if you're not, then you should try it out

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Hook]



[Chorus]
You're growing up little man
All the castles in the sand gone with the tide now
It's all a part of the plan
Stand tall, you gon' be all right now, just hold ya head
You're growing up little man
You got the world up in your hands, better hold on to it tight now
It's all a part of the plan
Stand tall, you gon' be all right now, just hold ya head

[Verse 1]
Sittin' by the water in the sand
Buildin' castles til the tide rolls in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just a refugee in Neverland
Thought my feet would never land again
Don't let the world steal your magic
The rising tide is automatic
Use your time wisely while you have it
Because tomorrow never stays
And yesterdays just a page
In a book of life
So catch the wind 'til you flying high
With that birds eye view from the sky
You'll feel that wind chill
That's just growing up
Case you know they say that castles made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually
And I know that I can do anything
Yeah you can do anything
Nothings impossible
You're unstoppable
But you gotta grow
Listen up

[Chorus]
You're growing up little man
All the castles in the sand gone with the tide now
It's all a part of the plan
Stand tall, you gon' be all right now, just hold ya head
You're growing up little man
You got the world up in your hands, better hold on to it tight now
It's all a part of the plan
Stand tall, you gon' be all right now, just hold ya head

[Verse 2]
Growing up little man
From a seed to a bigger plan
Even if you can't see there's a bigger plan
Young soul, so low in the solar system
And the clock is ticking and the world is cold
And then one instance your world could go
From the Little John to the Super Bowl
Flipped upside down like vertigo
So here we go, up up and away now
Never see the world if you stay up on the playground
Can't see the stars if you stay indoors
You can never have it all if you don't want more
You can never have light if you don't endure the darkness
Til it shines so bright you can feel the sun
But you gotta set sail in the sea regardless
Say goodbye that the beach that you leaving from (yeah)
But don't let it get to you now
There's gravity pulling you down
Keepin' one foot on the ground
Trying to keep you from looking around
But look at you now
Little man you're growing up
And ya here for more than showing up
But you gotta close one door in order for the next one to open up
But just take it slow, oh, oh
Everything is gonna be alright (yeah)
Just let it go, oh, oh
Your time is now but it's running out (running out, running out)

[Chorus]
You're growing up little man
All the castles in the sand gone with the tide now
It's all a part of the plan
Stand tall, you gon' be all right now, just hold ya head
You're growing up little man
You got the world up in your hands, better hold on to it tight now
It's all a part of the plan
Stand tall, you gon' be all right now, just hold ya head



Yeah, this shit right here is for all the haters
Alright, everybody sayin', "Yo dude, you can't spit."
And I'm like, I'm like, "Yo fuck that I can spit!"
Ha. So uh, let me just lay down mad bars
Yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'll spit a whole bunch of bars, re-roll up cigars
I am greater than the rest Supernova, the stars
You're just the common cold I am SARS
I do not spar, every single blow will hit hard
And I know what you are and hm, you're not me
Outdo you in anything bitch, just watch me
Drop shit on any topic, hotness
Then swap spit with hot chicks and get my cock licked
I'm a rot pit mixed with a little bijon
Hugh Hef in the flesh, Stay rollin' with three blondes
So don't hate this, I can't help that I'm great bitch
I spit a rhyme and then I'm outtie, Like an A6
I make hits and I hit the marijuana
Then beat the shit out of Rihanna just because I wanna
Haha, Nah, I ain't Chris Brown, I am Chris Web
CT is listenin' to everything this kid says
The only time I get bread's at a meal
Before my main course, god damn I need a deal
I'm broke out on bail and I'm livin' with my parents
But I spit, and got these high school girls starin'
Darin' to be different, apparently it's rhythm
That's keepin' me goin' every moment that Webby be spittin'
Spittin' like I got a loogie stuck in my throat
But fuck it I'm dope, the ring leader's runnin' the show
So ring around the rosie with a pocket full of OC's
Pop 'em all at once and OD
Oh me! Oh my! So high! I don't even want to land
Contraband in my waistband, rip it cause I can
Half man, Half ninja turtle
Half a fuckin' head case
If I don't make it on the mic I'll make a sex tape
Me, Kim Kardashian, and Paris in a three way
Burn it right to disk and make a million off of Ebay
I got true blood runnin' in my veins
Sharper than a vampire's fangs
Bang! Sneeze a lightnin' bolt, cause I'm always spittin' thunder
Runnin' shit like Ari, cause drama like Vince's brother
Smoother than butter with a pocket full of rubbers
And skills that'll make your girl s-s-s-s-stutter
Back up in this m-motherf-fucker with a vengeance
Make 'em pause like they got a comma in their sentence
You can tell I'm the shit as soon as I hit the entrance
Fuck the shampoo, we that rollin' that Herbal Essence
Cause I'm great like Alexander
Two Poke balls hangin', spit flames like Charmander
And I got your chick wetter than a Blastoise
She said I'm sexy and she love my raspy ass voice
I'll turn the stage into a slaughter house, ask Royce
Fuckin' with Webby is just a bad choice!
I'm a mothafuckin' goblin man
Get the cable vision rhythm, rippin' on demand
You can see me with the mic on my sonogram
The doc was like "hm, I think we've got a problem ma'am"
Had a rattle in my right hand, dutchie in the other kid
Diaper on my ass, thirty rack up in the fuckin' crib
Had 'em sayin' "what the fuck is up?"
Cause all I do is fill up cups and puff a dutch
Rollin' with a crew of giants like Justin Tuck
So if you really wanna step, better muscle up
Cause I really got to show 'em when enough's enough
Cause now these rappers trying to bite me like Scruff McGruff
Gotta get these damn dogs euthanized
I am back ill as can be, and super-sized
Like Star Fox, I am truly fly
Can't do what I do, excuse you I
Be runnin' shit with my manager younger than me
And I'm young as fuck, and still nobody fuckin' with me
I am in A&R's wet dream ready for the shit
Cause the games a fuckin' rap when they let Webby in this bitch

Because the game's a fucking rap
When they let Webby in this bitch. [x2]

Yeah, you know, mad bars
Maaaad bars
Spit straight on any mixtape
I'm ill, yeah, what



[Verse One: Chris Webby]
She's the picture of perfection, let's start with that
Type to give an elderly man a heart attack
She's bad, so goddamn sexy
Thinkin' dirty thoughts every single time she texts me
Bedroom hot and heavy, naked and sweaty
Hour after hour, non-stop, stay ready
We both down for whatever, that's why I got you
And you got me, so we rollin' to the top, boo
She's like a top model, and I'm a ill rapper
Down to kick it, roll a blunt and just chill after
Pop a pill after, shit, we're both nuts
Telling us to slow up, and we're like, "So what?"
'Cause we don't give a fuck, and they know it
Throwin' middle fingers up, bitch, blow it
The sex gets rough, I got the scars to show it
But she's the only one I roll with, that's my baby

[Hook: Chris Webby]
She's the one that I keep to the side of me
Ready to roll, 'cause Mami gonna ride with me
From the moment the sun goes down until the morning
So sexy with every damn thing she do
That's why I can't hold back when I'm bangin' you
She my, she my, my mamacita, cita
She my, my mamacita, cita

[Verse Two: Chris Webby]
She like to fuck on the regular, but baby I'm ahead of ya
I've been doing dirty, you tamed a sexual predator
And since, it's hard for me to keep my dick in my pants
I guess this is the chance, for me to find true romance
Mami like 5'2'', dark tan complexion
Nice ass, real tits, with a slim mid-section
I know every dude stays looking at you
But since you're coming home with me there ain't shit I gotta do
You, do, somethin' to me, fuckin' with me
Under the sheets, babygirl's nothin' but freaks
She's five hundred degrees, so hot and spicy
Grab me, scratch me, slap me, bite me
'Cause since she got an attitude, she always wanna fight me
But since I like it rough, we can do it on the nightly
We stay gettin' drunk and fight, but it's aight, yo
It's worth it, the make-up sex is so tight, yeah

[Hook: Chris Webby]
She's the one that I keep to the side of me
Ready to roll, 'cause Mami gonna ride with me
From the moment the sun goes down until the morning
So sexy with every damn thing she do
That's why I can't hold back when I'm bangin' you
She my, she my, my mamacita, cita
She my, my mamacita, cita

[Verse Three: Chris Webby]
She's a dime piece, everybody know her, girly's well known
Sendin' me, naked pictures on a cell phone
Babygirl, I really think that I'm lovin' you
Either that, or shit, I'm addicted to fuckin' you
But it's whatever, we gonna ride 'til the suns up
Hit it harder than nunchuks, makin' you cum, yup
I am one-up on all of the rest
Because I do it like I done her and I did it the best
Sex drive on full throttle, you know what I'm about
What, give a fuck if we wake the people in your house up
Yeah, Mami's so sexual, don't gotta stretch 'cause them legs so flexible
Pop an X pill and just fuck for five hours
From the bed to the floor, and the floor to the shower
Dry off a little then it's back to the bed
'Cause she my Mamacita, yo, you heard what I said?
Holla!



[Verse 1]
Webby going hard, you can tell when I drop a line
Its like I've had my lyrics genetically modified
Sap giving me beats is like feeding a mogwai, after twelve o'clock on the dot
‘Cause I rap like I'm 'bout to stuff you and your squad into sarcophagi
Oh my God am I, blacking out again like I'm hanging out with that Cosby guy?
Killing rappers as easy as swatting flies, with that old school vibe, it's just like I've been fossilized
Murder shit, like they legalized the Purge when I'm rappin'
They choking like they having some kind of allergic reaction
See 'em nervously scratchin' on they epidermis and that's when I know I'll leave a crime scene, get the surgical napkins
Hackin', slashin', cuttin', leaving your mufuckin' head sufferin' from about twenty different concussions
Every time I try to get my life together, then the fans be like, "Man, where the crazy Webby, yo, I like him better"
So at last I'll give the people what they've asked for
Just get my weed, whisky, see them pills there? Grab four
Get my razor blade, a rolled up twenty, and my glass Roor
Meet me at the back door, tell 'em that I'm back, whore
I'm back, fuckers, huh, let's go

[Hook]
I could never be what you want me to be
Could never visualize what you want me to see
All I've ever known is that I'ma do me
A true MC, yeah I'm the master of the ceremony
Yeah I'm the master of the ceremony
Yeah I'm the master of the ceremony

[Interlude: Sap]
Yeah Web, talk that shit
Talk that shit, we don't let up on these fuckers

[Verse 2]
A new rap song with Miley Cyrus? Sorry I don't buy it
This is Hip-Hop, and now we all fucking surrounded by this
Rap, pop, and these bottles, and twerking it right on my dick
So fucking numb is the culture, we're like, "I kinda like it…"
That ain't the shit you bump by yourself, get inspired by it
Ain't the shit that makes you start up a movement, incite a riot
And give a voice to the people who need to be blindly guided
And see somebody to follow, so I'll be their Iron Giant
To help 'em forget their problems, at least for a fucking moment
When they throw them beats on and I speak to 'em and console 'em
Got fans, just know that like Caesar you could control 'em
Now what would y'all do with a legion of fuckin' Romans?
Us is entertainers, the ones with a chance to rhyme
Gotta give these people something authentic to stand behind
These rapper say they care, but that's only on camera time
Then they go right back to rappin' 'bout strippers
And damn it I'm, fucking sick of all this stackin' money, spending money, throwin' money
Shit it's a recession, most these listeners are owin' money
Cash Money, Young Money, his money, her money
But chances are they ain't never talking 'bout your money
Fuck money, know what I mean? This real Hip-Hop shit right here

[Hook]
I could never be what you want me to be
Could never visualize what you want me to see
All I've ever known is that I'ma do me
A true MC, yeah I'm the master of the ceremony
Yeah I'm the master of the ceremony
Yeah I'm the master of the ceremony
Yeah I'm the master of the ceremony



(Verse 1: Chris Webby)
Quick to the draw like an animator
Laying down tapes like I'm Hannah Baker
Microphone assassinator, rolling in a navigator
They just cannot load the data
Baby, now they know I made it
(Baby, now they know I made it)
Better get ready to bust, Merk you ready or what
I'm lighting the medical, giving the heady a puff
Nobody heavy as us, venomous touch
Got 'em all bellying up, better give up
Turning your city from metal to dust [click boom]
Make tombs for my adversaries
Make room or I'll have 'em buried
I'm cutting through all your capillaries
Give me, give me, all the God damn loot
With the trees on deck, baby I am Groot
So please, give me some more space to breathe
They saying things about me but the thing about me
Is I never care what all these motherfuckers think about me
Young and OG, spitting my game since ‘03
Feel a cold breeze whenever I speak to you
Speak the truth, living proof, I can reach the youth
And move a mountain, you? You just move around it
Try to climb it but the climate got your movements clouded
See the room is crowded when I pack the show
All black bumblebee, pull up at the door
Murdered out, when I’m burning out
Tryna get that money in absurd amounts
I'ma need a third account
I’m the one you heard about, listen
Campaign mode like a poli-tician
Never laid low 'cause I got a, vision
And I gotta bring that bitch into fruition
Got 'em wishing I would stop
But I never slow down like I’m running from the cops
Put some money in the pot
Got the pocket aces and I’ll take it no debating
Give me everything you got
'Cause I am the mic, the microphone killa
I grip the mic, like Mike, I’m all thriller
Looking for a bigger dinner
Got the world up on my finger-tip like a fidget spinner
Bitches, because you know that I’m the

(Chorus: Chris Webby)
I am the mic, the microphone killa
I am the one with the golden gun
I am the light, recite with no filla
Don’t step to the best and expect respect
I’m on deck so it’s best to protect your neck because
I am the mic, the microphone killa
I am the mic, the microphone killa
I am the mic, the microphone killa
I am the mic, the mic, the mic, the mic, the
The microphone killa

(Verse 2: Merkules)
I’m the microphone killa with a gun on my waist
Fuck out my face, drink tequila out the jug with no chase
And runnin' with apes, gorillas, fuck the love, it’s just hate
Snatchin' crumbs off your plate and ask if you got something to say, I doubt it
I’m feelin' violent, I’ve been a tyrant since Pokemon
My potion’s strong, I’m the OG like Obi-Wan
I’m going hard like a virgin’s first booty call
Every verse will give them pins and needles like a voodoo doll
Now every single rapper Big Merk is taking doo doo’s on
See me in a camo balaclava when the news come on
Shout out Webby, we the youngest with the juice
I got an army right behind me, we are hundred, strong salute, yeah
These bitches salty, they feelin' froggy, well get up off me
What’s in the coffee? I fold em up like I did the laundry
I’m Kurt Cobain, with a hint of Ozzy, my shit is hauntin'
I kill 'em softly, I’m ice-cold like I went tobogganin'
Nevertheless I never fall off once
I’m Air Jordan in his prime and y’all the Walmart Chucks
My fan base will keep growing like Paul Blart’s gut
One bar in the booth will get these Pop-Tarts stuck
I’m sayin', these ignoramuses think I’m famous, the shit is dated
I’m sippin' Jameson thinking about which whip to blaze in
I feel the hate it’s just motivation to get me paid with
So if they say they don’t like me that means I fit the A-list
Hey bitch, why you mad at the kid? I’ve had it with this
You think you dope, but I’m actually sick
Hackin' this shit, back in the mix, gargantuan shit
You think you slick, you get slapped with a dick, no question
Everybody wants to head off Merk
It’s R.I.P Prodigy, I’m bringin' hell on Earth
We the truth, we the ones that you should bet on first
Yo Webby, this shit’s like a 110 bar verse, let’s get it
It’s probably 'cause I’ve never wrote my shit in double time
Which means that now I have to go and add in just a couple lines
Fuck it’s fine, we the illest right now
CT to Canada like how you feeling right now

(Chorus: Chris Webby)
I am the mic, the microphone killa
I am the one with the golden gun
I am the light, recite with no filla
Don’t step to the best and expect respect
I’m on deck so it’s best to protect your neck because
I am the mic, the microphone killa
I am the mic, the microphone killa
I am the mic, the microphone killa
I am the mic, the mic, the mic, the mic, the
The microphone killa



{Intro}
This is for all the happy rappers
Who have real nice deals
And have no idea what it's like to work this hard and still break even..

{Verse 1}
I'm aware I'm a little nuts, and I know I'm a headcase
Unpredictable moods are a toll that the stress takes
I carry the world's weight tlil my shoulders and neck ache
And my sanity be going downhill like a sled race
All day my legs shake, like a nervous tick
This Adderall don't work for shit, it only gives me thoughts that got me worried sick
Feelings are so bottled up, the cork is decomposin'
And if this shit got opened, it would cause a damn explosion
With overflowing emotions that I kept pushed down
Like it was someone I was trying to drown, I know it now
I'm a little tightly strung and see I know I need to find a doctor
And a therapist and a shaman who got some ayahuasca
'Cause surviving in this game that's full of irritants
Has got me wonderin' if I'll make it, my greatest fear is this
So when you hear this shit, you'll hear the hunger
As I'm trying to stay financially afloat and keep appearances
'Cause I've been in this middle ground, people say I made it
But there's so many that still don't know what my name is
It's hard to get a grasp on where I stand up in this game
And all I know is I wouldn't be this broke if I was famous
'Cause shit, I'm almost thirty, and still I feel like such a mess
I added fuel to the fire until I had nothing left
Under stress, with a life full of emptiness
Giving my all, and not a penny less

[Chorus]
In this middle ground, wondering if I'mma ever blow
Middle ground, tearing at the fabric of my soul
Middle ground, feeling like I'm stuck up in the whole
And these insecurities follow every where I go
Middle ground, feeling like I'm barely gettin' by
Middle ground, second guessing why I even try
Middle ground, all I know how to do is survive
So mad that I wanna scream, so sad that I wanna cry

{Verse 2}
I'm sick of felling like I still got shit to prove to you
What? I gotta go on Sway again for a salute from you?
Go pull some dumb publicisty stunt shot by a movie crew
Just to be in the same conversation of all these newer dudes
All my life I've been fighting to be accepted
And when I'm not I can't help but to be affected
Unfairly percepted, people making assumptions
Off my melotonin levels and the state that I'm reppin'
Like I'm some kind of spoiled one-percenter, go and get the facts
Shit, I'm the product of a hard working middle-class
Just 'cause I wasn't bustin' a pistol or flippin' crack
Doesn't mean I don't got a story worthy of written raps
I'm getting by though, there's Kibble up in Moose's dish
It's better than it use to be, but see the truth is this
I re-invest almost everything in this music shit
You think I'd still live at my parents if I was rich?
Really? See I'm just trying to keep my business intact
My sanity come second to these lyrics that I rap
Chainsmoking from stress, but at 10 dollars a pack
I'm killing myself and killing my pockets with every drag
Fuck it, I'mma keep on pushing though because I deserve the glory
I got an army of fans that would murder for me
I do this shit for them until the whole planet has heard my story
Reporting live from Purgatory

[Chorus]
In this middle ground, wondering if I'mma ever blow
Middle ground, tearing at the fabric of my soul
Middle ground, feeling like I'm stuck up in the whole
And these insecurities follow every where I go
Middle ground, feeling like I'm barely gettin' by
Middle ground, second guessing why I even try
Middle ground, all I know how to do is survive
So mad that I wanna scream, so sad that I wanna cry



[Intro]:
Yeah, Webster
See I've been quiet for a minute, now these bitches think that I lost my sound
Everybody chill, I've been getting my business off the ground
Finally successful, but to you that means I sold out?
Well fuck it so let's remind these people that there's really no doubt
Webby's still the beast that he's always been, and I rap hard
So check my wifi signal yo, I still got mad bars
Whippin' like it's NASCAR, still no one can touch me
All you pound puppies never stepping to a husky
Repping for Connecticut, stomping on you midgets
Smoking weed, taking pills, fuck it where the whipits?
No one can ever do it like I did it
Spit so big you gotta right click it, scroll down and zip it
I'm Santa Claus's misfit rolling with a thick bitch
Rappers out here ollieing, me I triple kick flip
Murder any beat and leave the listeners to witness
Jason Statham even scared to put my name up on his hit list
I watch these record labels all assemble the full
Rise terrible rappers whose skill levels is questionable
They have a hit single or two and disappear into obscurity
Me? I paid my dues that's why these motherfuckers heard of me
Haters getting madder now, wishing I would beat it
All because I fucked they girl on the top of my Tempur-Pedic
Sprinkle sugar on the Bible, sweet Jesus
Punchline pros leaving rappers with they teeth chipped
Webby been a genius, like I told 'em previous
Usuain Bolt on the track can't compete with this
The state of hip hop now is straight tragic
Turn the radio on, what do you know- some more wack shit
Except for a select few, because if your nice, then your nice
Got bars? Salute, I respect you
Cause half of these cats raping these days are from a test tube
A puppet to the label that they're soon to be in debt to
Me? I'm fucking meant for this
Downloaded and rendered it
Really in the game now, I'm through with my apprentice shit
Kids these days don't even listen to the sentences
They bumping Gucci but don't know who Jimi Hendrix is
Cranking Drake songs while they're cruising in their mom's jeep
But never heard of Big L, Rakim, or Mobb Deep (fuck that)
That's why I'm here to spit crack
Kids blowing up without paying homage to the legends, I ain't with that
This shit is crazy man, it's depressing really
The game is smoke & mirrors never let deception get me
I keep my guard up so if they come and step to Chris
These wannabe rappers about to get ate like it's 7:50
Nobodies diss me? Fuck so what?
They just want me to use their name so that their buzz goes up
So keep yapping it, pretending we got personal beef
Like I'm gonna lose sleep? Shit I never even heard of you B
We took some BIG and some Pac and mixed it up in a pot
And Eminem is what we got so is it really a shock
That another Caucasian rapper sticks out of the flock
That's got the lyrical capacity to level a block
I'm still chilling playing Nintendo
Faded off the Benzos
Fucking these hoes, you just stuck up in the friend- zone
Your girl texting me, ending with an XO
Fuck your Emojis, let me see them breasts yo
I'm Lou Ferrigno, about to Hulk smash this
Webby the pick of the letter like digging for cat shit
Trying be a rapper now a days is on some fad shit
Youngins' getting tatted hopin' they'll be in them mad kicks
Thinking all you have to do is learn a couple rap tricks
Buy some snapbacks and mad kicks to get your swag sick
Make a Youtube account, voilà that's it
The next big thing overnight like magic
But Katniss only the strong survive here
Listen dear, like the Hunger Games every single year
People rise to the occasion or they fumble it's clear
The only guarantee is that you'll see the death of a some careers
Been on my underdog shit for awhile
No more white kids keep popping up jocking my style
Then I'm still unsigned
Staying hungry on the grind
Now i'v been rapping along with the fans I gotta been alive now
Lie down cuz I'll be coming for you if you steppin to me
It's my time now
You cannot interfere with this shit it was destined to be
Reppin' the C.T. New England shit
Tri- state too we bring it bitch
Stuck within this game when most people would rather sing than spit
Can you believe this shit? The game is fucked man
Cause all these people only in it for the buck man
Another mixtape, all are free
Because when Webby's in the booth you know it's bars on me



[Intro]
Yeah, can I get a, pack of Marlboro 27's please?
Yeah, thank you, thank you
My card was declined?! My uhh, well fuck man how much are they?
Nine dollars!? God damn it
Man I got six, i got six, can we... No?
Man FUCK!

[Chorus]
If you don't know then somebody shoulda told ya!
But uhh, ain't shit for free
Like momma always said, ain't no one gon' do it for ya
And I'm sick of tryin' to make end meets
So I'm just tryin' to get the money money money money
I like how that sounds
I'm just tryin' to get the money money money money
They say it makes the world go 'round

[Verse 1]
Webby
Watch my peers getting richer as they sold they soul
Like fox selling out I'd rather be dope then broke
But as I got a little older, this roller coaster of life
Got me feeling like I closed one door
Another opens up with a new expense to pay
Car insurance, health insurance, with that dental date
Keep asking, "Why you living with your rentals, eh?"
You get it now? I don't got no fucking rent to pay
I made it big in the game but I sure ain't rich
How I invisioned being famous just sure ain't this
If I only had a nickel for every word I spit
But I don't, so now it's time I go and stir up shit
Cause I'm just tryin' to get that money and I don't care how
So fucking bad I'm 'bout to pull that BB gun back out
Run up in the liquor store like, "Bitch get on the ground
Give me the cash, and some whiskey, and a dutch right now!"

[Pre-Chorus]
What I'm saying's till I'm dead and buried
I'ma get that money now by any means necessary
Repeat
What I'm saying's till I'm dead and buried
I'ma get that money now by any means necessary

[Chorus]
If you don't know then somebody shoulda told ya!
But uhh, ain't shit for free
Like momma always said, ain't no one gon' do it for ya
And I'm sick of tryin' to make end meets
So I'm just tryin' to get the money money money money
I like how that sounds
I'm just tryin' to get the money money money money
They say it makes the world go 'round

[Verse 2]
And as this, the money comes in and then it goes
As quick as it came from shooting this videos
The beats and the time spent in the studio
And then it runs out, well time to do some shows
And you've got all the expenses of honor roll
Salaries for the team and vehicle
Gas, food, hotel rooms, that's a lot of dough
"Why you complaining, ain't this what you've always wanted, yo?"
I guess so I just need a bigger check sir
Maybe have a couple diamonds hanging from my neck sir
And I'm below full of cash in my dresser
That's higher than my overall current net worth
"Well Mac Miller's got money" Yeah you probably right
I got an idea, let's just go and rob him tonight
Like, "Hey, we haven't spoken since 'I Need a Dollar' but like
I still do so run those motherfucker pockets, alright!?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Just kidding, what I'm saying's till I'm dead and buried
I'ma get that money now by any means necessary
Repeat
What I'm saying's till I'm dead and buried
I'ma get that money now by any means necessary

[Chorus]
If you don't know then somebody shoulda told ya!
But uhh, ain't shit for free
Like momma always said, ain't no one gon' do it for ya
And I'm sick of tryin' to make end meets
So I'm just tryin' to get the money money money money
I like how that sounds
I'm just tryin' to get the money money money money
They say it makes the world go 'round



[Intro: Apathy]
It's to the point where I don't even wanna close my eyes anymore
I black out and wake up with blood on me and shit
Everything feels like a fucking nightmare
And I feel paranoid like everybody's fucking with me
So, I just attack everything, all the time
You hear people say that they hear voices inside of their head, telling them to do shit?
I think I am that voice that they hear...

[Hook: Repeat x2]
Fear what they don't understand, became a monster (Yeah!)
What they do is can't...conquer (Webby!)
Monster...I was destined to come (Uhh)
Became a monster...Second to none

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I got more wordplay than a chess set on top of a thesaurus
More trees than a forest, I roll it up and torch it
Brain is so contorted, that I need to be deported
To the nearest insane asylum when I wake up in the mornin'
It's the dawn of the dead, call up the feds, better warn 'em
Webby's on the motherfucking loose, take caution
So, why you startin' me?
The fuckin' Lincoln Memorial ain't even as hard as me
Or dudes that I brought with me
And my temper be quicker than Jimmy Darmody
With half a pharmacy flowing through each one of my arteries
Me and AP, that Connecticut rap
You'll be lucky if you leavin' and your head is attached
Murder beats, so I hope your instrumental is strapped
Cause if it's not, it'll gets its fuckin' skeleton cracked
All that, bitch I go Kenan & Kel on a track
So, you can picture me on top and then develop the facts
Ha!

[Hook: Repeat x2]

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I got raps ricocheting in my brain like a pinball
The force from the impact, they pack could spin y’all
In circles in the air with the slow-mo pose
AP’s known to snatch souls like wizards and crows
Fuck bitches and hoes, y’all are midgets and trolls
I see visions, like prophecies written in scrolls
Your whole shit is exposed, due a bid to my foes
So switch roles, flee prison in the visitor’s clothes
Escape artist, the rawest, my mixtape’s the hardest
I harness the power of hollow-points in a cartridge
Cartin' off body parts in a Wal-Mart cart
The werewolf after dark, Half-man, half-shark
I’m sharp as a box cutter, better start flinchin’
Put spikes through your head until you look like Bart Simpson
No concealed weapon, let these mothafuckas know the deal
AP stands large, wreckin' cities like Cloverfield
A monster

[Hook: Repeat x2]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Rippin’ mics, spittin’ nice
I’m a monster, came from a vision of Vincent Price
I’m just livin' life, grab a knife, start committin' seppuku
Clever view, with my language now I’m makin' revenue
I was bred to hunt like an Irish Setter do
So if you think you’re ahead, then I’mma sever you
A lot of the hills in front of me, so I’ma pedal through
Until I’m in your TV, like the letter U
Alphabetical menace, when I get in a sentence
So, if you step you’ll be the next to regret it
Punch-line killer, leave you shredded like lettuce
Then I’ll dip with your chick and get her wetter than Venice
CT’s on lock, try and break this flow
2-0-3’s mine, AP’s got the 8-6-0
Now, Connecticut’s together like never before
We got the guillotine ready, leave your head on the floor
Bitch !

[Hook: Repeat x2]

[Outro]



[Verse 1]
Catch me where the red ferns grow
Smokin' bud that burns slow
So turn the damn dial if your speakers turned low
Cause everything I'm doin' is loud
I'm just chillin' on a mothafuckin' cumulus cloud
I stay high!
Up in the galaxy like Pluto Nash
Stupid ass thinkin' any one in your crew's gon' last
But you knew those facts -
I'm the dog that whipped Pugo's ass
Fat bud, call it sumo grass
So you better give me kudos fast
Won't stop till I got that Borat n Bruno cash
I'm a box office success, puffin' the best
Got that Godzilla, green
Same color as Shrek
So lets throw it in a Dutchy or Philly or EZ Wider
Bong, bowl, bubbler, hookah, or vaporizer
Maybe throw yourself a batch of brownies in
As long as we be gettin' high count me in, ay!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm just livin' on a cloud
Chillin' in the sunshine
I got a dub n a dutch
I think its blunt time
Eyes bloodshot, contacts dry
Wear my sunglasses even when I'm inside
I'm high -
Like the THC in my system
My weed is medicine
I need it for living
I twist up my words while I speed up the rhythm
Because I be high as fuck 'n I don't need your permission
I'm twistin', burnin' on a cloud
Smokin' on a joint that would make Bob Marley proud
Jam with the Buffalo Soldiers
Chillin', let me stir it up
Trench Town Rockin' on a beat then I burn it up
You better learn your stuff, beware
I'm just a kid who didn't pay attention in D.A.R.E.,
I've been high all day since eighth grade
Stay blazed off that grade-A haze and AK, hey!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Rollin' up an eighth of grass
Any time I blaze a track
Cause I stay burnin' like a fuckin' pyromaniac;
Keep at least an ounce where I'm stayin' at
Dutch in the whip, puffin some piff
Who fuckin' with Chris?
(Nobody)
Anywhere I go, you know I got some pot
Green with orange hair like Roger Klotz
Got that Carrot Top drop
No stems, no seeds
Takin' bong rips to see if you can OD
But you can't, all you get is a cough 'n real hungry
Tearin' the fuck outta the fridge with the munchies
Pass out in boxers in front of the TV then
Wake up at like three PM
Then its wake 'n bake time
So roll yourself a joint
Cause if you're not high
Then whats the fuckin' point?
My heads in the clouds
I'll never be sober
I'll be a pot head till its over
Closure



[Produced By Alex 'AK' Kresovich]

[Verse 1]
Hello, in a muscle car murdered out
With a purple ounce, that motherfucker that you heard about
Spread around the internet because of word of mouth
Cannonballed off the deep end and swam further out
Tryna stack absurd amounts with a purdy spouse
Put one in the air like Super Smash pulling Kirby out
Jury’s out? Fuck it, I don’t care I’ma vent
And get fucking intense like Native American sex
Fuck the money, when I started I was there for respect
That’s why I’m still in Connecticut where my chariot rest
I’m on the edge, do y’all dare me to step?
Will y’all just find another rapper to rep and even care if I left?
Watched too many people run with my formula and get famous
Now all of em fucking famous and boy I’m just fucking waiting
Put my life up on the line for the glory that I’ve been chasing
Recording down in my basement, money poor but I was patient
Now I’m hustling and moving up, kid’s super tough
I ain’t popping? I tell em soon enough
I kept my circle tight, it never loosened up
And cut the snakes out like Medusa up at Super Cuts
It’s my job to get up on mics and say wild shit
Never once did I suggest that you should try it
Shut your trap, I’ma need a little silence
Let me do my job, is that alright bitch?

[Hook]
Hello, it’s so good to see you, it’s so nice to be back
Gather up ladies and gentlemen, just vibe to the track
Grab a seat, dim the lights while I’m reciting this rap
Best in the burbs,  let's remind 'em why my title is that
It’s good to see you, it’s so nice to be back!

[Verse 2]
I remember being lost and hopeless in my parent’s attic
Feeling claustrophobic, but I never lost my focus
I’m back, hurting from a mix of mild scoliosis
And the weight of carrying the fucking state up on my shoulders
I’m on a marathon ahead of you, dude
They sucking wind, turning bluer than a jeopardy clue
The jealous ones developing resentment for the crew
Without knowing what I’ve been through
So come and step in these shoes
So what I didn’t sell crack and had a stabler home life?
Middle class white, they been hating my whole life
But they saw me grow up just like Raven Symone, right?
Scrawny little punk, to the Razor Ramon type
Independent and continually making fans
Turned down a lot of deals, and chose to make a stand
Fuck selling out, homie that ain’t the plan
Why push the envelope? I’m tackling the mail man
So here I am as I’m rambling, pants sagging
And ransacking the game, no receipt for the transaction
And they hopping right on to the band wagon
With this puff the magic dragon stuffed into a gram bag and
Attacking these beats thoroughly, in my prime currently
Only way to get me to shut my mouth is to murder me
Sure to be a legend, impressing with every story told
Go balls to the wall like I’m fucking y’all through a glory hole
My destiny is still an open book, just haven’t had my moment
I’m still underrated and overlooked
But fuck it yo I feel terrific
We’ve already made it further than anybody predicted
Tapes on tapes with a handful of crazy tours
Led here, this the moment we been waiting for
To my fans, I’m extending my gratitude
Chemically Imbalanced, enjoy the fucking album dude



[Chorus]
I don't see no sunshine
All I see is moonlight today
Wake up when the night fall
I just let the stars guide my way
I don't see no sunshine
All I see is moonlight today
Wake up when the night fall
I just let the stars guide my way

[Verse 1]
We be hanging with the goblins
Livin' dead, thriller mobbin'
Damn, I'm such a night crawler
Damn, I'm such a night crawler
The boogie man is my weed guy and he swings by with that ganja
I'm running out I might call him
I'm running out I might summon him up
What, runnin' a mock, all when the sun isn't up
Don't want it with us, trust, doubling up
Throwing that bud in the dutch
Keepin' it hush, no you ain't got say shit
I see the moonlight on the skyline and I chase it
Got vitamin-D deprivation, aight
Don't need daylight savings time
Trying to lead a generation
Follow me up into space, and I'm
Using constellation navigation out to my destination
If it gets too dark, use echolocation
Follow my senses on out from the basement
So while you afraid of the dark
Cold heart give 'em goosebumps
R.L. Stein when that moon's up
Nightrider with a tune-up
So who's up? Who's nocturnal like me?
Insomniac in a Pontiac, I don't get no sleep

[Chorus](x2)
I don't see no sunshine
All I see is moonlight today
Wake up when the night fall
I just let the stars guide my way
I don't see no sunshine
All I see is moonlight today
Wake up when the night fall
I just let the stars guide my way

[Verse 2]
I might have to make a sacrifice
Witches broom make me levitate
Poison potion 'til my stomach ache
I know it's tainted but I love the taste
Yeah, I can feel it taking over, yeah I can feel it taking over
Whiskey mix in that Cola, like Doctor Jekyll with the soda
Mister Hyde betta hide ya, and no one to help you inside of here
There's something under your bed, I'm coming for you at night yeah
Better sleep with a nightlight and a dream catcher and a crucifix
And a garlic necklace, and an exorcist
With the silver bullets and extended clips
So we never miss, inhale mary, I'm devilish
No spiderman, I'm Eddy Brock, on any block, so venomous
It's treacherous when that moons out, people turning into silhouettes
Shadows moving can't see shit, but that cherry burning on the cigarette
Yeah, mirror mirror on the wall, you can hear me when I call
Moonlight wolf howling, 'cause I'm coming for it all now
Now who's up? Who's nocturnal like me?
Insomniac in a Pontiac, I don't get no sleep

[Chorus]
I don't see no sunshine
All I see is moonlight today
Wake up when the night fall
I just let the stars guide my way
I don't see no sunshine
All I see is moonlight today
Wake up when the night fall
I just let the stars guide my way

[Outro]
I don't see no sun, I don't see no sunshine
Wake up when it's night, wake up when the nightfall
I don't see no sun, I don't see no sunshine



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm the monster out of Cloverfield, so for real
Fucked up, I don't even know how sober feels
Smother Asher Paul Roth with a fabric wash cloth
That I previously used to wash my ass and balls off
I'm just a dope rapper, in class chasin' a math teacher
With a protractor then copy the notes after
So hot you'll think that I freakin' sleep on a burner
Want beef? I'll force feed a vegan a burger
Slaughter on the mic, I don't need a reason for murder
So A.D.H.D., that I need at least a Concerta
It's Chris Webby, brain dead but still deadly
My shit's heavy, pop pills and twist heddies
So kick and slap me bitch, I'll take it like a masochist
Then turn around and smack you with the mic that you be rappin' with
Cause I'm the opposite of pacifist, choke a ho, slap a bitch
Then leave the room laughin' after it
Like what !

[Hook:]
For myself, I have no regrets
Time has taking what it soon forgets
Again there's paradise, in short venue

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I get up on the beat and I blaze the mic quickly
A serial killer takin' blades to Rice Krispies
An Arabic terrorist in America
If you wanna get at this, I'm triple dog darin' ya
I'm a character like Mickey, Donald, Goofey
Ren and Stimpy, Snoopy, Captain Planet, bitch you best salute me
I'mma loopy looney-tunes with screws-loose, super soakin' dudes deuce
I'm Michael Vick with Blues Clues
I'mma mothafuckin' monster man
Get it poppin' like the guns playin' Contra man
Contraband, stuck in my pipe so let me light it
Got a dark passenger like Dexter, why fight it
Lightsaber, swipe it like Qui-Gon-Jin
(Skurr!) burnin' rubber til I ride on rims
Brim to the side, got a sack to spark
I'm cold-blooded, you can find me in Jurassic Park
Like what

[Hook:]
I feel alone when the Sparrow's sing
No way of knowing what tomorrow brings
I leave my solitude upon his wings

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
My wisdom exceeds all you dumb MC's
I'm young too, but shit I've been rappin' since 3
Since the youngest Jonas Brother was still in his mother's uterus
And Miley Cyrus was in diapers, bitch I ain't new to this
I'm what you get when you mix alcohol and nicotine
Aderall, Ecstacy, Marijuana and Creatine
Acid, Percocet, Vicodin and Ambien
Shrooms, MDMA and toss a Xany in
Then you got me, mind clinically dumb man
I can count my brain cells on one hand
But I drop sick bars, homie, so you gotta look
Bitch, I be nicer with the ink than an Octopus
I'm that villain out the comic book creepin'
Crawlin' out the flames like a demon, breathin'
Flames out my mouth so nobody could touch me
A mix of Buffalo Bill and Bundy, trust me

[Hook:]
Though it's pleasure, is to hear in time
To paint a picture's what he's left behind
I close my eyes and it all leaves my mind



[Intro]
If you're in need of a ghost writer
Not like me
You choke up when you're in the cypher
You're not like me
If you're not constantly dropping fire
You're not like me
Naw naw dude, you're not like--

[Verse 1]
See Web been big in the game like Shaq O'Neal
Way before I even had no deal
Tune to the broadcast in my Bat-Mobile
And think; Damn, really this is the rap ya'll feel?
The standard has gotten so low, I don't even know
They sellin' out shows and rap about nothing
So now every regular Joe
Picks up the mic and they think they can flow
"Wait, all I gotta do is get a couple tats and talk about ass
And titties, and cash? Hmmm, that doesn't sound hard
Ya know what man, I think i'm going to rap", fuck that
They get a laptop with a pro tools pack, spit something' whack
The next big smash
Hit number one with the same old trash the last dude did
And we call it rap
What else can I do but say fuck it
I'm really not mad at the rapper for making it
But I get mad at the people who keep up the cycle
Buy into this garbage on iTunes and pay for it
So uhh, if you really wanna save hip-hop, better take your pick
Either support what's real, or get used to the same old shit

[Hook]
So many people trying to do it, I can't keep up with the names
Just a bunch of carbon copies and they shit is all the same
But regardless of how many other rappers in the game
All I know is that I'll promise one thing
They not like me
They not like me
They not like me
They not like me
They not like me

[Verse 2]
No matter where the hands on the clock might be
It's my time, so check up on your watch my G
All I need is gym shorts and a stock white t, fuck swag
I'm gonna show you why they not like me
I've had it with rap, ya'll rappers are whack
All that I'm hearing is stacking up cash, and strippers, and bottles, and fatness of ass
Who's fucking buying this crap
So I'm giving you all something new, the shit I do
Ain't never been seen by a kid like you
Inked up white dude with an attitude, hate on, I ain't mad at you
But just check my shoes, Imma just do it, do what I do
Making this music, drinking my booze, smoking my Buddha
Shit i'm the truth, fuck all your rumors
Fuck you all doing, really what happened
Only a hand full of people are rappin'
Nobody is worried about being dope on the mic
They focusing more on their fashion
Ya'll ain't no emcees yelling about that life, ya'll just frontin'
So I've been sent here to remind you of something
That there's-

[Hook]
So many people trying to do it, I can't keep up with the names
Just a bunch of carbon copies and they shit is all the same
But regardless of how many other rappers in the game
All I know is that I'll promise one thing
They not like me
They not like me
They not like me
They not like me
They not like me

[Outro]
They not like me (nannah, nannah)
They not like me (nannah, nannah)
They not like me (nannah, nannah)
They not like me



[Hook]
I'mma go ahead and do my thing
You just gotta let me off the chain
Yeah I'm off the chain, off the chain
You just got to go and let me off the chain
I'm off the chain

[Verse 1]
I'm like a rap star minus the money and the record deal
Bitch I'm whipping in a piece of crap car
But I don't give a fuck cause I spit it mad hard
You could inspect my lyrics never find a bad bar
I'm in my backyard rolling chronic, rap rollick
Artist like Jack Pollock, drop shit so sick I need an antibiotic
I'm an otter and I'll crack you like the shell of a mollusk
Oh my God, it's Webby With a machete
Ready to go after both Jason and Freddy
I am deadly like a black mamba, sipping Odwalla
Mixed with vodka running shit like the Godfather
So call me Corleone, I'm rolling with 40 homies
And you could hold the camera, come watch your shorty blow me
My first is in five minutes like off of the brains
So ask anybody bitch they'll say I'm off of the chain, ay

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm the next big thing in case you couldn't tell
Give me one mother fucker who'd say I wouldn't sell
I'm good and well here in the underground
Unsigned Hype dude, I don't fuck around
And see I'm buzzing now all over internets
Webby's on the web, you're behind if you haven't clicked it yet
I'm shooting free throws all you people miss the net
I'm off the chain bitch like an evicted pet
Get it? Cause if a pet got evicted
It, uh, wouldn't have a leash on... Man, shit, forget it
I'm twisted, roll it up, hit it
I'm so fucking dope They should put me on exhibit
Cause you know I rip it every day spitting more and more
Magic than any Slytherin or Gryffindor
Dumbledore's stepping in, feeling like the principle
Don't need a body guard, Webby's invincible
My life is inimitable, but I'mma push 'em to the back
Like I hired 'em as actors, I'll put 'em in a cast
With the punches that be flying at speeds above fast
So retrace your foot prints, bitch step back
What?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I walk in they call me the kid like Billy
Crushing Keystones all night get silly
Let's throw down at beer pong cause bitch I'm illy
Hit six cups, then I re-rack 'em like Willy
I am a Gremlin and I rhyme never ending
Stay getting high got no time for descending
People give me praises any time I get mentioned
Even though my skin's whiter than the belly of a penguin
I need an intervention before I go brain dead
With a pencil is the only time I aim lead
But me and your girl gon' wake up in the same bed
Wiping her mouth claiming she never even gave head
I'll murder K-Fed and hit Britney up
Oh, you got two kids? I don't give a fuck
She said hit me one more time so I hit it up
Lohan, I got a Trojan come here you little slut
So messed up looking for a pair of Double D's, please
Step to me, I fucking dare ya
Oh God, I'm seeing double no Tia and Tamera
Cause I hit 'em like Bam I don't need a Margera

[Hook]

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Yeah I got em saying
Ohh noo, ohh noo, ohh noo, ohh noo x2

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah nigga, oh no, gin and four loko
Who you getting crazy with, ese?  You know I’m loco
Headbutting hoes like I’m ocho (cinco)
I be in the valley with the stoners and the cholos
Niggas stacking more dough, you know how that shit go
You should get a pen, write it down and take a photo
My cologne say Versace, my dick say blow me
My drawers say polo, yeah bitch polo!
Need a white girl with an ass like Coco’s
Hit that pussy right, girl I bought you some Menolo’s
That was Adderall, shit, I used to pop NoDoz
Used to have one bitch, now I got four hoes
Hi my name is Jarren, I am not normal
Aaron Schwartz in that pussy, hit it like Arnold
Mr. Drummond, Willis, Kimberly, looks like a porno
Skeeted in her face, I treat that bitch just like a urinal
Webby tell these hating niggas slit they wrist
Every track we on we take a shit on it
Ladies show your tits, meet a nigga back stage
Where you’ll see me pull my dick out and lick on it
Me and Webby hurting
And we murdering any motherfucker that's looking at us sideways
Cut the body five ways
We skin em and drop em off on the highway
These pussy ass niggas so irate, we got em screaming…

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tech N9Ne]
I was sent to  demolish and decapitate whoever thinking they killing
Doin' the hottest we activate and murder many men that make em' say god is a rapper, wait
Better bow before Nina, don’t even try to spit at the great
Sick, then I’ma get pissed, their finna get wack and fake
Bitch, get on my dick quick, give it a lick it, acclimate
Get what you’re giving, give her the gift and go gravitate
Acting a ape, I ate up a animal I aggravate
Whole lotta people getting a whiff of the Niner
They loving a nigga cause I’m a hell of a rhymer
Women are looking finer, I never decline her
She wanna climb my timer, stick it and I slime her
I get the pudding, never gotta wine and dine her
When a busta run up with a broken heart he get a shiner
When it comes to murking on music I’m a deadly designer
I’m drinking my Hennessy mixture out of a Steiner!
If he tripping I'ma buck or I’ma cut a nigga up with a machete
Cause I’m running with a gang that’ll bring that flame
With a thang and it’s heavy
You don’t wanna fuck with a Tech N9ne
Or my nigga, JB or Chris Webby
Havin everybody sayin “oh no”, bustin up the window of a 6 Chevy

[Hook]

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
We don’t fight fair, we right here
We the reason you’ve been waking up with nightmares
Got em running, got em running
From the second that they see us coming, I got em saying…

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Hold up
On your mark, ready, set, go
Look at Web flow
I be jabbing with the right and then I hit em with a left blow
Knock em back in time like they chilling with Bill and Ted, yo
To a land before time, T-Rex ho
So many bars you would think I’m living on Death Row
Webby just a motherfucking dog, where’s Petco?
Follow a plate of kibbles n bits with an egg roll
Genius in the laboratory cooking blue meth, yo
Call me Heisenberg, cause when I rhyme with words
These motherfuckers are behind the curve
I drive and swerve, turn and I ride the curb
And hit every pedestrian that doesn’t find the nerve…
...to get out of the way, “Jarren did you see that shit?”
Yeah maybe you should drive, cause the weed I hit
Got me feeling so loca, la vida, bitch
Why you even pass me that shit?
But fuck it man I am an animal, but you never seen my species
A brand new breed they discovered in CT
Homegrown bitch, yelling “feed me, feed me!”
And every listener is pressing repeat
Bitch I got a sick mind, stomach bug in the brain
Insane, you gotta keep me handcuffed with a chain
But I’ll still break out like Burt Wonderstone
So anytime you see me coming, yo, I got em yelling out..

[Hook]

[Outro]
Strange Music, Funk Volume, Homegrown
Juggernauts of this independent hip-hop shit, man
Bitch!



[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been on my grind since I hustled twenty bags of piff
Now I'm trying to make a living off this rapping shit
Back in the day they all used to laugh and shit
Now they asking for a VIP pass and shit
Used to stay up all night and I practice it
Rhyme book up in my hand and a track to rip
You ain't even half the Chris, ask your bitch
Lean back, light it up, and relax a bit
I hit the bottom, now I'm living sick
Posted with a chick, EZ-Wider full of piff
That's enough to keep me happy so I'm living like this
Till I'm spending all my money and they put me in a ditch
We all gon' die, so while we still alive
I'm trying to get by, baby have a good time
Let me live it up, let me just grind
Go and live your life, homie let me live mine (ah)

[Hook Miss Daja]
On my grind x8

[Verse 2]
It's been a long hard road and a lot to go
[?] with the flow can't lock the can't block the blow
Trying to compare your mission is impossible
I'm just trying to make a living, can't knock it bro
Getting high man, chilling on the coast eating fried clams
Facebook hits from CT to Thailand
Went from no money, to having show money
Sved to the Ciroc and it's so lovely
No I don't Dougie, this is real rap
Suburbs to the block, gotta feel that
Since the White Noise fitted with the ear flaps
I've been on my grind none stop now a year passed
And I'm still going every day Webby (flowing ship?)
Moving at the speed of a NASCAR motorist
Time flies and we only getting older quick
So I'm here to party, yo enough with all the soberness

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've been dropping ill flows since I still rocked a diaper
More bars than Rikers, pull an all-nighter
With your chick big tits, looking foxier than Swiper
Hit then flip the TV on and play some Street Fighter
Living good with a dutchie and a lighter
Going too hard, baby put me in a cypher
Smoother than a cup of apple cider, dope rhyme writer
Grinding every day until I'm whipping in a Viper
That dude from Connecticut who got my name public
Following my dream and I mother fucking love it
If you got a dream go and make something of it
Because if you ain't doing what you love (then?) fuck it
Never let somebody tell you what you gotta be
Be yourself, have fun, live life, be free
But you gotta work for it, yo look at me
All I ever do is G-R-I-N-D (see)

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah baby, I am x5



Read Chris Webby's Explanation "On My Way"
[Hook]
Let me hear ya say, ay
I been on this road too long on my, way
With my top down livin' carefree let me hear you say, ay
To infinity and the beyond I'm on my, way
Said I'm on my way (let me hear you say)

[Verse 1]
Why am I like this? Always on the grind like this, ever since '09 like this
Tryna find my niche..
And I got a taste of fame, played the game, and now I'm convinced
That the money isn't worth earning
If you don't take from the lessons you're learning
As you embark on your personal journey
Navigate life while that fire is burning
Deep in your soul, before you get old
And live with regret for not reachin' your goals
(No, no, no)
Just keep up that fight when your back's on the ropes
Because the people you think are the closest
Will turn into strangers before you could notice
Been stabbed in the back but I never lost focus
Got my eye on the prize till I hold it

[Hook]
Let me hear ya say, ay
I been on this road too long on my, way
With my top down livin' carefree let me hear you say, ay
To infinity and the beyond I'm on my, way
Said I'm on my way (let me hear you say)

[Verse 2]
I'm still reachin' for the skyline, got my hand raised, tell me teacher when will I shine?
Cause I've been sittin' in the bleachers on the side lines
Spent a whole life time, followin' the guide lines
Now I will strike while the iron is hot, aim right for the top
They will not deny me a spot
So fuck if they like it or not, cause my grind didn't stop
And I'm still in my prime sit and watch
As I do what I'm designed to do
And if my fans still ride then I'm ridin' too
If the numbers don't lie then I'm climbin' through
Supplyin' you, with music to find you through
Any time when the skies seem grey and rainy
And your dreams seem too far away
And life in itself's bout to make you crazy
Just put your headphones on and say

[Hook]
Let me hear ya say, ay
I been on this road too long on my, way
With my top down livin' carefree let me hear you say, ay
To infinity and the beyond I'm on my, way
Said I'm on my way (let me hear you say)

[Outro]
Don't see no rain clouds
Above my play ground, no no
Till the wheels fall off and we break down
I will not lay down, no no
.. Let me hear ya say



[Produced by SAP]

[Intro]
I got the game on lockdown, ridin' with the top down, and I'm feeling so good
Baby we'll be headed to the top now cause it's the only way to go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm on a roll now, traveling all around the globe
Only my booking agent know where I'm about to go
With a pretty young thing and an ounce to roll
Live that rockstar life call me Aldous Snow, uh
Feeling great, filet mignon on my plate
But I'm always staying hungry, you can see it on my face
You can see it in my eyes, I'mma win this race
Pulling through the finish line, like Brink on skates
And I'm feeling spectacular, still an eligible bachelor
It's so lovely, french kissing models with some molly on my tongue
In a different city every night like I was on the run
We gone, we gone, shout to everyone who supports me
Legal troubles over with, no more going to court, B
Now I'm chilling with a Vicky and a Courtney, top down, warp speed

[Hook]
I always told them "I will never stop" now, look at what I got now
Always knew that I would, baby, and we headed to the top now
Cause it-it's the only way to go
Now I got the game on lock-down, riding with the top down
And I'm feeling so good, baby, and we headed to the top now
Cause it-it's the only way to go

[Verse 2]
I been out to sea, had to send an SOS
But I made it back to shore and I'm next on deck
Always got a little sexy brunette on text
Saying "I'll see you when you back in town xox"
I've been slept on like futons, looked over like typos
Now you see my fucking name up in the lights, yo
Always been the under dog call me Fido
But I know, and always knew that I would win the fight bro
Either that or I'm going to go down swinging
Never back down if we gotta throw down, bring it
But still we having fun, strip club, pile of ones
And act a jackass, R.I.P Ryan Dunn
Shout to Sap always killing a track
We just some kids making money, what's the matter with that
And until I get a Grammy I'll be doing just dandy
The black sheep's now the bread winner of the family

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go

[Verse 3]
I only think about it when I'm looking back
To the kid I used to be writing lyrics during class
Back when I had nothing but ambition and a dream
And a composition notebook full of rhyme schemes
I mean, I was a fuck up, but then I grew the fuck up
And gave it everything while I was working on my come up
And now I came up and baby I won't stop till I'm done
So now I'm yelling at the top of my lungs (Let's go!)

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm feeling good right now, man
All these years of hard work are finally paying off
There's really only one direction to go now
And that's up, so ya'll coming with me or what



[Verse One: Chris Webby]
I'ma outdo you, don't know what I do to
You, bitch I'm cuckoo
Only white boy at private school, rockin' FUBU's
Spittin' flames like a dragon, homie, call me Mushu
Like Yogi, leave you with a Boo Boo, from punches and kicks
You'll catch a pummelin', now tell me, who's fuckin' with this?
I'm runnin' this shit, with my troublesome clique
Won't stop 'til I'm drownin' in a puddle of spit
Pussy tends to come my way, call me catnip
A fuckin' bull mastiff, hit 'em with a kick, make 'em backflip
This is madness, drunk and chuggin' a forty
Writing in my notebook, but this isn't a love story
Grimier than Nori, but I stay with cream
Leaving you lost, like Oceanic Flight 815
Real mean, when I get up on the mic and shred it
No copy, paste or edit, I'm nice, so don't sweat it

[Hook: Vice Versa]
And you know that I'm a rider, boy
So try the boy
He'll spit flames and fire, boy, so hey
I'ma outdo you, bitches, I'ma outdo you, bitches
And you know I'm spittin' fire, boy
Retire boy
Cause I'm a level higher, boy, so hey
I'ma outdo you, bitches, I'ma outdo you, bitches

[Verse Two: Chris Webby]
I make a point like Uncle Sam, stay puffin' grams
Drunk as fuck, with my red solo cup in hand
You better fuckin' scram, cause I am back, bitch
'Bout to be blowin' up like an inflatable mattress
Not one to mess with, cleaner than anti-septic
Check it, before this verbal Tec make your chest lit
I'm blessed, A+, five stars, with a check, bitch
Something like Borat - cause you will never get this
Yes, it's vindictive, always blazin' an herb
Pockets full of more trees than a nature reserve
Oh, word? The illest in the 203rd
So fuck what you heard, I'm kickin' 'em to the curb
With words illy, cause everything I write, you felt
Until I'm rockin' a gold metal like Michael Phelps
I'ma keep swimming laps around you, raps around you
Outdo you in things that I don't even know how to

[Hook: Vice Versa]
And you know that I'm a rider, boy
So try the boy
He'll spit flames and fire, boy, so hey
I'ma outdo you, bitches, I'ma outdo you, bitches
And you know I'm spittin' fire, boy
Retire boy
Cause I'm a level higher, boy, so hey
I'ma outdo you, bitches, I'ma outdo you, bitches

[Outro: Vice Versa (Chris Webby)]
Cause I'm doin' my thing, doin' my thing
I'm comin' back around like a boomerang
You know, you know
(You already know)
That I'm the one, y'all can't touch
Never stop rappin' 'til I'm rockin' handcuffs
('Til I'm locked up!)
You know, I'm dope
(I'm dope as a motherfucker)
And I'm holdin' it down, holdin' it down
(Holdin' it down!)
First rapper reppin' a suburban town
(Suburbs!)
Oh
Bitch, oh
Don't got no gun, but you gotta run
Steppin' to me, you're gonna get outdone
You know
(Cause I'm nice and you motherfuckers know, baby!)



Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "Outside The Box"
[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm livin' outside the box like a shipping address
Until I stack up all my chips and assets
Make my paycheck, blaze ya' tape decks
And see the whole world no Waze or atlas
They told me to shoot for the moon
But I grabbed me a pistol and shot for the stars
And that bullet ain't stoppin at Mars, so
Never let em try to stop who you are
A teacher, a doctor, a web technician
Athlete, a barber, or video vixen
Tattoo artist, chef, or musician
You could be what you want, kid listen
Stay on that mission like Ratchet and Clank
And don't get distracted by passin' the drank
Trust I've been through it, but stuck to the music
And now they see me takin' that to the bank
And you don't gotta love me
There billions of people out there I don't need you
And nobody gets a redo, but it's so far so good on makin' my dream true
And I'm here to shake it up like I'm playin' with snow globes
In my dojo, workin' and waitin' to go pro
Young virtuoso, makin' my dough grow
On my solo, stayin low pro, but they know though
You plant a seed and you gone see that bitch grow
Remember that for life and take it everywhere you go
Be what you feel you're born to be, follow what your passions be
And chase that dream until it's a reality

[Hook: Chris Webby]
They told me that I had to go to school and get an education
And live up to society and all its expectations
But I, made my own fate, got up and I paved my own way
So if you like me sing along to the song, let's all say
(I'mma live outside the box)
I can do anything, that I can think, I'll show you
(I'mma live outside the box)
I can go anywhere, I'll take you there, I'll show you
(I'mma live outside the box)

[Verse 2: Sincerely Collins]
I remember when you boxed me in
Told me I could never leave the box again
I was just lil' me, tryna find the real me
Knowin' that the box was a crock of shit
The box had bots that would block the kid
Every time I shot from my rocket ship
But then I found the light and it showed me how to fight
So I'm sayin' we can box if you box me in, for real
Give me a penny, I bet I flip it to a stack
They tryin' to lead me to Satan, I'm like who is that
I started this shit from the bottom, but I'm through with that
My confidence is in my hair because I grew it back
I hope you're not believin' all the bullshit
I hope you're not believin' all the lies
You just gotta get outta your own way
You just gotta open up your eyes
I can see the light inside you
Do I pray at night yes I do
Thank the universe, simply for the opportunity to spit this haiku, yeah
It's just light work, and you can do the shit if you think it
Get your mind right and just make sure that you practicin' what you preachin', cause
You plant a seed and you gon' see that bitch grow
Told you I came from the bottom now I'm 25th floor, I got
High hopes for me and all of my fam
If ever they tell you no, well fuck em, cuz yes you can...yeah
Fix God, Sincerely

[Hook: Chris Webby]

You couldn't touch 'em with a ten-foot pole. Nobody near to this
I'm serious, ripping the mic 'til I'm delirious
And I don't do it for the glamour and the glitz
I do it because I love it and I'm handling my shit
But there's some dudes doing it for all the wrong reasons
Spit nonsense, think there the hottest thing breathing
Ignoring all the real MC's who don't even
Have enough pocket change to break even
I'm steaming, tearing it down 'til I'm leaving
Music running in my veins, even in my semen
Webby straight hungry, somebody should feed him
Before I go nuts, cause a motherfuckin' scene and
End up locked up again and fuckin' spend
My last penny on bail so fuck it then
Lyrically, your everyday rapper can't touch me
But rap's full of dudes with no talent it disgust me
Trust me, I can drop names, make it get ugly
But that's just how it is, some people get lucky
Soulja Boy's fifth grade vocab
Get's played on the radio so much you think its as dope as
Jigga, Nas, Eminem, Busta, Fab
Jadakiss, Ludacris, maybe Lupe Fias-
Co, rap mode, clever and intelligent
The hottest in New England and ain't nobody forgetting it
I'm showing y'all that hip hop exists in Connecticut
I'm picture perfect I just need somebody to develop it
Right now I can't even afford a gym membership
Even though I rap with undeniable eloquence
I stay true to my roots and I know where I'm from
I don't front on no one, don't talk about having funds
Don't talk about slinging crack, don't talk about shooting guns
Don't talk about being hard, I talk about having fun
I'm second to none, something the world has never seen
Making music's in my genes, like a pocket and seams
Rocking the screen of any fucking camera that's in front of me
So deep underground that my tunnel be
Down with the dinosaur bones, grimy
I need a paleontologist just to find me
So complex every listener rewinds me
But it's my extensive vocab that defines me
I be pumping hip hop through an IV
Nobody else unsigned can out-grind me
No Ash Roth clone drop rhymes off dome
Just a rapscallion rocking the skull and crossbones
I'mma young cat coming out 21
Won't stop 'til I decide that I am fucking done
And that'll be never
The future of hip hop, bitch, it's Chris Webster



[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
I was coming down, I was switching lanes
I do it real big, that'll never change
Switchin' old schools, catchin' private planes
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I'm a mothafuckin' problem
Hip-Hop, what you know about it?
I murder everything, how could you ever doubt it?
Bitch I do this shit for real, when you see me shout it
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I'm a mothafuckin' problem

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'll get your girl's head spinnin' 'til that bitch is dizzy
Shot glass full and I'll tip it quickly
Shouts to Big K.R.I.T. in Mississippi
On my hustle, word to Nipsey
Back here to rip beats, that's what it is see
Gone for a second but I'm back, did you miss me?
Bomb on a record with the sack of the piff, B
Bomb any record when I snap and it hits me
You'll get chewed like a frisbee
I'm a rottweiler bitch and my leash isn't with me
I need a priest to forgive me
For the sins I commit from CT to Sydney
Jesus, indeed a psychopath
And not a goddamn soul could write this fast
Not a damn soul know how to write this track
Shuttin' shit down 'til the lights go black
Kill 'em with subliminals, unhittable
An original criminal with the syllables
Fuck a visual, I'm invisible
10-4, situation Critical
R-R-R-Roger that, I b-b-b-body tracks
So all these hatin' copycats can suck my dick and swallow that

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
I was coming down, I was switching lanes
I do it real big, that'll never change
Switchin' old schools, catchin' private planes
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I'm a mothafuckin' problem
Hip-Hop, what you know about it?
I murder everything, how could you ever doubt it?
Bitch I do this shit for real, when you see me shout it
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I'm a mothafuckin' problem

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
It's young Krizzle and I'm certified
Pull up in your lane with the bitch you came with 'fore you get inside
Built tight like a motherfuckin' cutlass on point
With the D's and the window tint
Wood on dash with the chrome on rim
Piled up twice I ain't tripping on nothin'
Bitch, you know what this is
Ain't got time to waste
Rather not grind the brakes
Rather just take my bread, get pounds of cake
Get a bitch down to shake, spring up in over head
Plot like chess, grind like skaters
Bring a bitch down like Garcia Y Vega
Must be fine and surround me with paper
League of my own, motherfuck your majors
Now I'm back on track
Dark with the flow, black on black
Twenty-four beat, I shat on that
Suburb with the urgin' to hear me rap
Still get love in the hearts of trap
Still hit the bank and they give me dap
See wherever Big K.R.I.T. been that day
Shit he thought Sugar Ray

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Rollin' in ready to fight and throw fists
I had a bad day and I'm pissed so don't trip
You wanna get hit? Then keep runnin' your lip
Because I got a short fuse and it's already lit
About to flip if you say another word to me
Not killin' a beat doesn't occur to me
Not true if they say they never heard of me
If you want me to stop, you better murder me
South to the North, holla back
CT love, I got your back
White boy's here and I rock a rap
Rock my brim low and roll that grass
So cinematic when I rock a beat
Cameras on, and they all on me
With my dude from the South K-R-I-T
If they steppin' in the way then R-I-P
Spittin' heavy dough
Need that fire? Let me know
That's why your girl's Facebook status is a Webby quote
I got 'em, ain't nobody big enough to block 'em
This isn't algebra baby, but I'm a fuckin' problem

[Hook]



Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "Questionnaire"
[Intro]
I got a lot of questions, ya know. As humans beings we're intelligent. That's the difference between us and everything else. So why wouldn't I ask questions, about everything?

[Verse1]
My teacher said there's no such thing as stupid questions
That's why I always ask myself, while other dudes are guessin'
Like why don't all these rappers nowadays pursue perfection?
Why has the music that I love gone in this new direction?
And why are people so afraid to get aware?
Why does this younger generation hardly ever seem to care?
Why did all the older generations let their greediness
Destroy the world around us for money? And then they leave us this?
And what is money really? Why do we need it, right?
Do you use it to plug your ears so you can sleep at night?
So you don't hear your conscience tryna make you see the light?
Why don't they care about us? We're all just people right?
Why are we killin' Mother Nature for the paper?
Why is everything extinct or, critically endangered?
Why couldn't we have found a way to live together?
So everything could exist forever? This is my questionnaire

[Hook]
This is my questionnaire...
This is my questionnaire...
It's time to get aware...

[Verse 2]
Why are there politicians?
I guess the better question is why don't they ever listen?
Why do they always have to lie to us? Why does the news just try to stir the fear inside of us?
What do they really have to hide from us?
Why are blind men leading other blind men
With ignorance in office and armies standing behind them?
Why do we kill each other? Why don't we heal each other?
Why do we break each other down instead of build each other?
Why are the smartest people labeled crazy?
Why are kids having babies? Why do doctors say to take these?
And why do big pharma companies have us by these puppet strings?
So, now we need a pill for every fucking thing
Why are there terrorists?
What if they just saw a therapist, changed their ways and moved to the Americas?
Are people really bad? Or are they taught to be?
Come get lost in thought with me, this is my questionnaire

[Hook]
This is my questionnaire...
This is my questionnaire...
It's time to get aware...

[Verse 3]
Why do kids do drugs? Wait, why do I do em?
I know it'll catch up to me and leave my life ruined
So why do I find myself drinking and pill poppin'?
Is it for fun anymore or am I running from my problems?
Why do I have problems anyway?
If I could show the younger Webby where I am today he would be blown away
So why's my self confidence always on the fence?
Why do I hear the hatin' louder than the compliments?
Why does my mom smoke weed?
Wait, I guess the better question is why don't we all smoke weed?
Why don't we tax the televangelists?
Better question, why can't kids afford to live on campuses and get an education like their parents did?
Why are the seasons shorter?
Why is the justice system rigged against people without a decent lawyer?
And really what is race? Cause I don't see nobody winnin'
How is anybody different? This is my questionnaire

[Hook]
This is my questionnaire...
This is my questionnaire...
It's time to get aware...



[Produced By:  Kato]

[Verse 1]
Listen I’m just here to kick it regardless of if you’re with
Regardless of the critics getting all up in my business
Regardless of the fact that getting here took me a minute
In this game of life, chilling with my stand-by ticket
Goddamn I did it, I built the stage to get my voice heard on
And it’s real to say
Shit I’m still a normal dude, got bills to pay
And if tomorrow’s not promised I’ma chill today
Cause like you we all bleed red, we all human
We all just tryna navigate our way through the confusion
We all just want a piece of the pie
I’m staying zooted while I’m waiting
Let me roll up a doobie and keep it moving
I got a few chinks in my armor, too
Never used to see the world, now I’m starting to
And I’m just reaching for the motherfucking stars like you
Without a joint that shit’s hard to do
So I tell em that....

[Hook]
We all gonna die one day, so what?
But while I’m kicking I’ma have my middle fingers up
Yelling “fuck you”
Cause when life gets tough I shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff
And we all got bills to pay, so what?
But while I’m in the green I’ll have my middle fingers up
Yelling “fuck you”
And when shit gets rough I’ll shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff
I’ll roll a doobie and puff, I’ll roll a doobie and puff
Chilling, baking out my Chevy with my crew in the cut
I’ll roll a doobie and puff, I’ll roll a doobie and puff
Shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff

[Verse 2]
I’m just out here tryna function
Bobbing and weaving through the percussion
While I’m puffing on a magic dragon daily like it’s nothing
As I watch my competition and proceed to one-up em
And if they don’t like what I’m doing then, man, fuck em
And if they ain’t been down since jump I can’t trust em
Ever since my friend ratted on me and I ended up cuffed
In the back of an undercover whip
Cause my homie couldn’t help but run his lip
As soon as the fan was hit with some fucking shit
But that’s life and I’ve learned how to choose my friends better
Learned how to master my craft and be a trendsetter
Learned how to get knocked down
Learned how to get back up
I learned how to rock these crowds
Learned to accept that what’s...
...going on is a blessing beyond a logical fact
I don’t know if God is real but someone’s watching my back
Maybe it’s my boy Nick, we still miss you cuz
Next joint’s for you, now roll up

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
I’m gonna take a puff
Then I’ma blow it out
I’m gonna roll it up
And then I’ma burn it down

[Hook]



Some people still speculate...
Is he really as nice as he says he is?

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah, anytime I step I blaze it thoroughly
No one seein' me, y'all need corrective laser surgery
Check my date of birth you see, Webby's only 21
Hotter than the summer bitch, you know I got it covered son
Get it done when I get up on a beat and I tear it up
Cause all I got in this world is my word and a pair of nuts
Bring em in I'll air em out, hustlin' like Escobar
With lyrics sharper then the claws retracted in a leopard's paw
Check my repertoire cause I been grindin' for a minute
Heh, and even the haters admitted I can spit it
This rappin' is a sport to me, break it down importantly
Whiter than a kilo bitch, I'm bringin' Boston George with me
Ramblin' answerin' the hate and spit it gorgeously
Can't handle him I'm Anakin, and yes I got the force with me
Torture beats, have them all askin' where the chorus be
Bitch I'm good money and ain't nobody affordin' me
Playin' my cards right whiter than a Marb light
Voice raspier than Christian Bale in the Dark Knight
I got my competition sayin' Our Fathers
And every fuckin' hater runnin' scared like Paul Walker
I don't fire deadly shots, never with a semi cocked
Just light up headie pot and spit venom, call me Eddie Brock
Webby drops, whether you ready or not
Heavy metal or pop, so steadily I'll get to the top
Clever as ever so what, the bass and treble will not
So fuckin' loud its like gettin' hit in the head with a rock
I'll leave em dead or in shock, when I spit it I'm a rap rebel
With my size 10 Jordan on the fuckin' gas pedal
Grab the mic and I go
Ain't nobody messing with the rhythm I flow
Need that dough, Tic-tac-toe
Break mothafuckers like a Kit-Kat bro
Hit that dro, pass that back, layin' low, 20 sack
Then I roll it up and hit it till that shit's all ash
Then my drug dealer gonna get a call back
Back on a track accurate that's the reason I'm so relaxed when I rap
Cause the facts are the facts and the fact of it is
Next to Em nobody spit this crack
Bring it back, crowd packed, dog I'm rippin' more beats
Carrying the game just like a baby in a stork's beak
I'm servin' my competition like Roddick
I'm Doctor Robotnik, with knuckles in my pocket
Toxic, so fuckin' dirty you should wash it
Got this, hot shit, LeBron couldn't block it
Spittin' it with flavor, rippin' wisdom on the paper
Bitch I get the block hoppin' just like Tigger was my neighbor
Precision like a laser, no one playin' with this
Cause this rap is second nature like inhalin' a spliff
Then I throw together words and I rip shit ill
No one ever done like Christian will
Spit with skills, bitch this real
Brain slowed down on prescription pills
Need a deal, damn straight, make the fuckin' land shake
Ari Gold lookin' for me since he seen the fan base
YouTube, numbers up, Facebook, yeah what's up
All you do is Google me and haters keep they mouth shut
Now what, like a deer hunter all about bucks
If you tryna' to burn with me you'll need at least an ounce plus
It's in my nature I guess, I'm fuckin' meant for this
Ain't no type of censorship equipped for all my sentences
The booth is like my octagon, you don't wanna enter this
I'm Anderson Silva so step in here you're gettin' leveled quick
Poppin' stars and I'll be ravin' until I'm sober
I'm not afraid of shit, I'm as brave as the Little Toaster
Cocaine and some bakin' soda, I'm crack next up to bat
Griffy Junior to these losers, no ones fuckin' with the stats
Pupils fat and got a bag of molly in the pocket
I'm like Pikachu shovin' a metal fork into a socket
I'm electric, style eclectic, all these haters try to mock it
But spit so fuckin' flawless they can't help it but to jock it
Son I'll rock it, and now they all bloggin' about the hotness
Datpiff hot this week with a million comments
The big new thing, read about me in the comics
Under Hi and Lois rhymin' potent lyrics better watch it
Now I'm back and I rip it up and spit it so nice
Ain't nobody messin' with the poltergeist
Skin tone white, takin' flight
So far ahead that I'm out of sight
Down to fight, rip it on a mic
There never been a night that my pen don't write
There never been a night that I don't rap nice
When I'm on the right weed and rolled up tight
Hold that mic, get it in, who could ever mess with him
Sick go get some Levaquin, the medicine you get it then
Show em' I'm never settlin', fuckin' paper shredder em'
You wanna step? Then your chances are lookin' extra slim
Grindin' every day reachin' the top
And I'm only a step away, you don't believe me? Watch
I'm a beast on the mic, there's nobody left to help you
Cause bitch I'm nice, how many times I gotta tell you?

Damn man, fuck these haters, I'm out, ha



[Intro: Chris Webby]
Yeah, let's go in on em Knodge
You already know
Yo keep that vaporizer plugged
In though you already know
I'm be back there in a second
I'm sorry mom I had to do it to em
I mean uhhh yeah yo

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm a hard one to get along and get on a song
While I'm smokin' that Godzilla and battlin' King Kong
Straddlin' lovely women and doin' my thing hard
Eatin' rappers on my diet with a Nutri-Grain bar
I still whip the same car, smoke bud out the same jar
And get higher than a fuckin' Quasar
I am a senior to these rappers, never a J.R
And stay rollin' like a cart through the isles of K-Mart
Spit it with flava, don't work but play hard
I'm on my space ship about to invade Mars
Any opposition, I'm embarrassin'
Allergic to wack, so if you steppin' to me, I'll need a Claritin
Rappin' straight heroin, no one can compare to him
Spittin' flames like Eragon, Canada to Maryland
Brazil to Alaska, they know me as a rapper
Stay fly, just turned in my applications to NASA
Roarin' like Mufasa, eligible bachelor
Your girl's like a slice of cheese all up on this cracker
Phenomenal flow, bein' better than Webby is not probable
If it's even possible yo, rockin' a show
Droppin' it, my brain moves very slow
Comin' around like havin' sex on a Mary-go
Killin' any scenario with my man Adam Generio
Who's had faith in me since the beginnin' so there we go
Here we go, and I'm back on a beat
And fact I'm a be, I'm actually
Gradually growin' up, rollin' up a bag of the weed
Dope as fuck, hittin' em' up like Kimbo bitch
Swollen nuts hangin' down lower than a limbo stick
I get it crackin', get your windows fixed
So try to run, I'm a catch em' like we playin' sharks and minnows bitch
Ya'll can't see me like a blind mouse
I'm a bad boy just got off a time out
This is my house you'll get beat without a doubt
Cause ya'll are sittin' ducks, like Daffy on a couch
I get them punchlines know what I'm a fuckin' bout
Haters need to get them selves some scissors bitch, cut it out
I'm a fuckin' grouch, no Oscar
Music runnin' in my veins, learned it from my father
Ho don't even bother, I'm back to chokin' ya
That's why they scared of Web like Arachnophobia
Haha, bitch

[Verse 2: D. Lector]
And he's back, Knowledge
Officially changin' my name to Danimal Lector
Body collector

And you are about to get broken in like a new clutch
Your rockin' with them two fucks
Who killed White Noise, them white boys not the Ku Klux
Don't get it screwed up, I'm too tough
Built like a mothafuckin' GI Joe, minus the crew cut
Holdin' a huge dutch, swollen like it juiced up
I'm doblin like dude what, I don't pass after two puffs
Two words I never heard, "you suck"
Like LeBron fadin' away with the J better suit up
I'm reinvented literally, listen to the differences
Now I got my green growin, call me Photosynthesis
I wrote a song about it and it goes something like this
My dicks at the top of your chick's Christmas list
So bitch let's get it poppin like acne
As we, tag team this rap game, tag me
And I'll gladly jump in and swing for the fences, relentless
So if you wanna step, bring your dentist
Or catch a death sentence, my wordplay's tremendous
And the chronic Super sonic on some Shawn Kemp shit
I'm a problem, matter of fact I'm grimy
Like Mad Max I've been a badass since the 90's
Flashback finally
People startin' to recognize that I'm the shit.com back slash try me
Faggot ass your solved and to add to that, tiny
Push your eyes in traps back try and find me
I'm high so don't mind me
Danimal to cosminot, a lot of pot
Shit hits hard, I call it Ronnie Lott
Kicks like a karate shot, my dicks like a shotty cock
Ready to bang and your chicks like "oh my god he's hot"
No shit bitch, haha, what up Webby!



[Hook]
It's that evil rap nemesis, putting together sentences
Let it be said a bit with the excellent rhetoric
It's that evil rap nemesis, putting together sentences
Verbally a double barrel shotty, leave you blown apart
It's that evil rap nemesis, putting together sentences
Started off small, now I do it for the masses
It's that evil rap, evil rap, rap rap nemesis, putting together sentence--

[Verse 1]
It's that evil rap nemesis second coming of Hendrix
Breaking laws, flipping off Officer Friendly, bitch
I'm a Jedi in the booth, with the power of phantom menaces
Light saber swinging, chopping off your appendages
Generously applying the dopest of rhyming
Open your eyes and see the headlights running over you driving
Over and over and over it on the road that I'm riding
You better open your mind or I'll do it for you (alright)
I'm just a mother fucking psychotic, neurotic, embodiment
Of everything your parents told you not to be probably
Taking shots out the bottle and now Alcoholics Anonymous
Smoking White Rhinoceros with Zach Galifinakis
Dropping hits of acid while rapping that's multi-tasking a lot of shit
Practicing karate kicks on people back in the audience
Popping Klonopin, obviously, shots'll be honestly
You, pull me out the party, I'm the shit ain't no stopping me dude

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The Governor up out The Walking Dead I'm at your head with an axe
And you mother fuckers better get the cameras ready for action
So listen up, Webby is rapping and Semi is scratching
Shit is bound to cause a deadly reaction
Step to Webby motherfucker you gonna see how unfair feels, repping Fairfield to Norwalk
So damn, real, and you know I stay with the trees like Bear Grylls
Jimmy Hoffa the fucking beat and leave them in landfills
I just stand still, back in the building, spit this shit so cold
You can feel it in your cavity filling
I'm just trying to get some money till it stack to the ceiling
With all these motherfucking tracks that I'm killing
Well you know I got my Super Mario star, I'm untouchable
Fucking Clair Huxtable making her put an oven full of brownies with the hash oil
Then we cook them up until I toss them in my tummy and my brain is dysfunctional

[Hook]

[Outro]
Now-now-now-now-now I-now I-now I do it for the masses
Now I do-do-do it for the masses
Now-now-now-now-now I-now I-now I do it for the masses
Now I do-do-do it--



[Intro]
Yeah, Webby
Let me talk a little shit man
Ahem

[Verse 1]
Bitch, you done released the Kraken
I’m up on Mount Olympus while I’m rappin’
So when the lightning strikes, the waters churning, thunders crashin’
And them twisters touchin’ down like that movie with Bill Paxton
It’s me up in my studio, that’s what’s makin' it happen
Never doubt me, got a suit of armor big as Gronkowski
And a sword that’s even bigger killin’ everyone around me
Swingin’ like Tasmanian Devil until I’m drowsy
Then I pop another addy and blast off like Robert Downey
Like Ironman, the kind of man that knows no one can beat me
The kind of man that’s destined to be king, just ask Rafiki
The kind of man to step into the ring just like Rikishi
And make you kiss my ass on broadcast national TV
Lay the smackdown on all these wack clowns in the circus
That use to be referred to as the fuckin’ rap circuit
I’ll rap circles around these cats without scratchin' the surface
And make these mumble rappers step back and start actin’ nervous
And if they aren’t nervous then they don’t know what I’m sayin’
Maybe they can’t understand it with that first grade education
Maybe they too fuckin' high off cough suppressant medication
As they wearin' skirts with a matchin’ purse while they puttin’ braids in
But that shit is just a fad and see I’m here to help to phase ‘em
All the fuckin’ way out so real rappers can replace ‘em
I’ll take this shit upon myself, the fans deserve better
Than some kid who lacks intelligence and puts in zero effort
I mean this shit is a job right? And see these kids ain’t even tryin’ son
If you ran a business and they worked for you, you would fire them
So why you praisin’ them for half assin’ the shit you listen to
Not dissin’ you, I’m just asking what the fuck has gotten into you?
See you’re the consumer, and it’s your choice on what you pick into
Put up in your Spotify and spend your time siftin’ through
And you’re just givin’ bread to somebody who’s way more rich than you
Who can barely put together an english sentence in an interview
See I’m a hooligan who be truly losin’ his cool again
Who’s here to use his voice to bring the truth 'til I get through to them
They feed us fake news again, nobody wanna listen
It’s no fault of ours, me? See I blame the politicians
Fuck Donald, fuck Ivanka, nah for real I’ll fuck her brains out
Got her riding me up in the oval on the same couch
Billy Clinton scrubbed the cushions tryin’ wipe the stains out
'Cause Monica just couldn’t swallow what was in her dang mouth
I’m fuckin’ wildin’, fuckin’ while I’m on that shit again
Slappin’ Rex Tillerson for tryin’ to let them drill again
Light his oil money on fire, like every bill and then they’ll put me on a list
'Cause see you know them bitches listening
And Jeff Sessions you can suck a dick until your throat hurts
You old smurf, you tryin’ take my weed, never gon’ work
I’ll be lightin’ up a doobie out on your turf
And Kid Rock, you ain’t been cool since Joe Dirt
I’m out on Scott Pruitt’s property, frackin’ it
And build a pipeline through his wooden kitchen cabinets
These scummy politicians, yo I’ve had it bitch
I’m a take a knee with Colin Kaepernick, yellin’ fuck the establishment
And Ted Cruz, your face puts me in a shitty mood
There’s so much bitch in you that you probably have a clit and boobs (uh, you're a bitch)
And Marko Rubio, you’re soft as fuck
And Ben Carson, yo, can someone wake Ben Carson up?
Fuck these Nazi’s and the white nationalists
I’ll grab that Costco tiki torch and fuckin’ smack you with it
Over and over 'til your skull fragments are crackin’ and shit
While the cops give them a slap on the wrist, for real though
But yo Hillary, really? You think that I wouldn’t mention you?
Just 'cause I tend to be liberal with all my general views (you're a cunt)
But you’re an evil lady, say it 'cause I got to
I’m down to have a woman President, just not you!
You Claire Underwood-ass bitch, you wicked witch
Lyin’ through your fuckin’ teeth every single chance that you get (bitch!)
I’m a slap her so hard that she’ll be leavin’ in a gurney
While I’m yellin’ out, “Long live Bernie!”
Now if that segment just offended you, then please relax
We’re all on the same side, it ain’t about white or black
It’s about the one percenters versus everybody else
Us against the politicians who only helpin’ themselves
Yo, fuck it, I guess I’m just a rapper, what do I know man?
About the world, how it turns and who’s behind those plans
But still I’m all up in this bitch just like a gyno’s hands
And while I’m here, I’m a take a stand
Raw thoughts

[Bridge]
Fuck everybody, man. As much as I joke around about things, ya know, that shit is dead serious. Fuck where this country is headed, ya know? Who did I not mention?

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, Mike Pence, see I forgot to slay you
But really? God hates you
Along with every gay dude and lesbian, it’s very evident (I hate you)
That you’re a scum suckin' bitch Vice President (suck a dick)
Who else?, Oh Paul Ryan, shit I hope you go rock climbin’
And your hand slips and you lose grip
And you fall divin’ on to a bunch of fuckin’ dicks
You fuckin’ bitch, I hope your health insurance doesn’t cover it
Who else? I’ll crack a Koch brother like I crack a coke can
Cremate a Koch brotha then I’ll snort ‘em out my hands
What bitch? Raw thoughts
These are my raw thoughts motherfucker

[Outro]
This message has been bought, paid for and forced upon you
By George Soros of Fake News Networks of America
Raw thoughts motherfucker



[Intro:]
Yeah, ha ha

[Hook:]
Got the weed in my dutch, liquor in my cup
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go
Got my speakers turned up, rattle in my trunk
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go

[Verse 1 - Chris Webby:]
I've been ready to go, full sprint, I'm ahead of the flow
Strap C-4 to my chest, know that Webby'll blow
I've had this mean demeanor in me since forever ago
Nothin' but green lights ahead, I push the pedal and go
A veteran pro, veins pump seven below
And will cruise until he got it, never settlin' so
I'm ready to go, movin' quickly in my pole position
No one holdin' Christian, more venomous than a cobra spittin'
Crush you, no position, with the illest and dopest rhythm
Cause they soft, weak-hearted and wack with no ambition
I'm Obi Wan Kanobi with the flow you can't control me
I'm a mixture of Paulie, Christopher, Sylvio and Tony
An honorary Soprano, with mono y mono
With Castallano, and hit 'em with a Liu Kang combo
Skin tone blanco
Though when I get up on the beat, I spit 'til I'm blue in the face lookin' like Ganzo

[Hook:]
Got the weed in my dutch, liquor in my cup
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go
Got my speakers turned up, rattle in my trunk
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go

[Verse 2 - Googie GoHard:]
Okay, what's good, Chris, thanks for lettin' me on this song
They'll catch a buzz for light-years, to infinity and beyond
My affinity falls, the liquor has been bitter sweet all along
Though to the best of my abilities, then breeze homie, I'm gone
Let's get it Webby, son, I'm ready to go
Just drop me off at the liquor store to get some Henny to pour
I hope in CT they got that good heady to smoke
(Shitstain) Well I'm dope, thanks for lettin' me know
I'm a cocky young wordsmith, stickin' to the cursin'
And tryna make my word fit in one of these bird's lips
I see you hawkin', pigeon for the squawkin'
But when I give her the rooster she diggin' them eagle claws in
I'm leaving with back scratches, bruises and open gashes
Jesus, I'm looking like Christ from the Passion
Rock new clothes but a nigga old-fashioned
Hit it, then she runnin' back, yeah, Bo Jackson

[Hook:]
Got the weed in my dutch, liquor in my cup
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go
Got my speakers turned up, rattle in my trunk
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go

[Verse 3 - Chris Webby:]
Yeah, yeah, I'm not like these punks who lack hustle
I'm big, they weaker than Stephen Hawking's calf muscles
Nothin' but trouble with a dub up in my bubbler
Hotter than summer under a Goosedown comforter
Hennessy up in my cup still I never stutter words
THC runnin' through my jugular, fuckin' serve
Anybody who thinks I'm just a gimmick, I spit it how I live it
That's why everyone on Twitter had to click it
I'm the raider of the lost ark
Make the DJ bring it back like a false start
This ain't a fallacy, my dude, cause I can truly flow
And play the hand I was dealt, somethin' like Yu-Gi-Oh
Since a long time ago, spittin' freestyle or flow
Drunk with a pen in my hand like Edgar Allen Poe
And I won't stop 'til I'm a millionaire
Put the pieces together, bitch, Build-A-Bear

[Hook x2:]
Got the weed in my dutch, liquor in my cup
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go
Got my speakers turned up, rattle in my trunk
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go

[Outro:]
2010, Chris Webby, Googie GoHard



[Verse 1]
See now my cup is full, my vibe is boosted
My fate is undecided, but it's going down the way that I choose it
Living life up on the stage and it's like I'm on display
And the fans coming through when they know every word to the songs that I fucking play
Bang the speakers out blood sweat and tears are leaking out
Girls in the crowd are freaking out, labels reaching out
Buzz is peaking now, when I'm doing everything I dreamed about
Man, I think I'm on one, saw the easy route, took the long one
And now they ain't ready for this crazy white boy
Running through the rap game like Donkey Kong
Cause I be super smashing them I'm back with a rap attack
I'm homegrown and I grew the roots and it's about damn time that I flew the coop
So mother fucker let me show you what this dude could do
Going through the roof and I'm gonna hold my own
CT down to the bones, so anywhere I'm going you know I'm coming back
Cause as they always say, there's no place like home so then I'm gone

[Hook]
Ride on...yeah
Baby, where you wanna go
Got my foot up on the pedal till the sun goes down
I just hop up in the driver's seat and
Ride on...yeah
Baby, where you wanna go
We be riding, we be riding
We be riding, yeah we be riding on

[Verse 2]
I'm here to do my thang, so what you really know about that shit
Good kid in a fucked up game, suitcase still packed from the last trip
Light this and I feel alright, turned around my life
Started from the bottom, now I'm in the middle
Sitting first class on a flight and I still got fight
As long as I got a mic I'll recite the type of hype shit that'll spark ignite
And set the world on fire when I give it a light
You never heard of one like this in your life because I go so hard
Got these bars on me, baby, I'm a super star and the bass go roar
Like I got Simba trapped in the trunk of my car
R-R-Roger that the rhyme is back , stepping on the gas pedal when I ride a track
Real shit, anybody that deny the facts, fuck you, ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody got time for that shit, the same kid crashing Datpiff
Is back to the smack the world off it's axis
I'm in the game now, you better go home and practice
Firework in the sky bitch, get so high, fuck around and hit a pilot
I'm just feeling like it really is my time, this rhyme shit ain't for the weak
Don't try this, at home if you ain't ready for the life, this game brings to you whether or not you like it
So I'm telling you all the ups and downs so you can see the world I'm in, looking through my eyelids

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rittz]
I came close to being known as the guy that coulda made it
Frustrated with the industry, how can I motivate it
Feeling like the only loser that my parents pro-created
Watching homies that associated with me blowin'
Waited for my turn in the light, [?] was so belated
I was jaded, when I made it, it was hard to believe
Even harder for me not to wear my heart on my sleeve
While people judging me in the public {?}
The comments underneath my video, my skin had to thicken up
It's hard to describe the feeling when somebody telling me that my music got them through when they were feeling like giving up
He's standing right in front of me and tearin' up
Cause he in love with his girlfriend and they breaking up
He waking up, playing my music it helps to lighten the blow
Playin' "Wishin'" and "Sleep at Night" like 20 times in a row
Mouthing the lyrics when they hear it getting hype at the show, I love it
Ain't got no money, but I'm getting through
Gotta remind myself time to time when I get in a depressing mood
I'm getting paper, slayin' beats and help out the
[?]
Look at my dressing room
1,000 miles away they want an autograph
He said he like my deep records and my party tracks
I scribbled thanks across the bottom half
It's Rittz and Chris Webby, you ready, let's hit the launching pad, let's fly

[Hook x2]



[Intro]
Y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Y-y-y-y-y-y-yeah
Webby!
See I'm trying to get drunk as fuck tonight man

[Verse 1]
You see I’m back here to rip another throwback jam
They’re like damn, I don’t know how Webby go that HAM
Lift your shirt up, baby girl, show that tan
Skin covered in cartoons, but I’m a grown ass man
I don’t care about your name, when I’m steppin’ to you
All I’m thinkin’ about is that we got some effin' to do
Sippin’ on a potion like Dr. Jekyll would do
Cause I got loose screws in my head and it’s true
I need my medication renewed I’m doing this shit
Start howlin’ at the moon at a lunar eclipse
Bark, growl, scratch every human I bit
And choke the fuck out of a beat until I’m losing my grip
Maneuvering quick looking for a huge set of tits
And beat it up sorry babe but you'll be bruisin’ a bit
Whip it out so you all could get a view of my dick
Because I never gave a fuck and now I’m proving it bitch

[Hook]
Hey, and this is my favorite song
Sing along when the DJ throws it on
I got a bag full of weed and a big-ass bong
And we gon' drink till we can’t tell right from wrong

[Verse 2]
Holy Moly, Webby’s here
Hit a house party, drink every beer
I’m just tryna find a girl real sexy here
And if you’re not DTF hit the exit dear, ha
I just say what I say, I’m drunk as hell, fuck it
I’ll even take a grenade
Just give me a fat bitch and a bottle a day
As long as I’m drunk, you’re never gonna hear me complain
Hey, hey, I’m the last Beastie Boy
With my dick in a girl’s mouth like a squeaky toy
In a pitbull’s grill, rip shit still
Hole in my brain from all of the E pills
I’m a motherfucking crazy dude
Eatin’ baby food, a turkey dinner with some gravy too
First place in a race, I’ma cross that line
So lock me up doc, cause I’ve lost my mind

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See Webby comes back with the horse play
A liability, at least that’s what the courts say
In a bedroom, get too rough
Take a bite out of a bitch looking for True Blood
Uh, I do it like no other
Condom in my pockets, I'll do it with no rubber
Got the bed shake and you think that you heard thunder
And got ‘em running back to me quicker than Road Runner
And I get ‘em in the sack tonight
Beat it up, I don’t care if they be black or white
Or tan, a blue, a green, I still smash it right
Make it hot, I don’t even need a match to strike
Ha, nobody could stop the beast
With a tongue this slick when I rock the beat
Sweepin’ all your girlfriends off they feet
And I don’t even give a fuck if they got some teeth, ha

[Hook]

[Outro]
Damn, I'm drunk man, fuck!
Couple forties deep and shit
Webby's Lab, as always you know
Cooking up that crack rock
Ha, shouts to Obie
Aight man, I'm fuckin' outta here dude



[Intro: Chris Webby]
Ha, yeah, it's Chris Webby
Danimal Lector in the mo'fucking building
You know, Connecticut, ha
Webster's lab, bitch, let's go, yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You now have entered Webby's world, welcome to my habitat
Living like a Jason Statham movie, always action packed
Killin' competitors, cause seein' me lose a battle rap
Just don't happen these days like seein' a Pterodactyl hatch
So give me beats and I'll be runnin' to the lab with that
Go in with a pen and a pencil, come out with a bag of crack
Show up with a bunch of goons, you ain't never matchin' that
Roll so fuckin' deep, we know where to get Krabby Patties at
Deeper than the ocean floor, U-571
Larry the cable guy, cause you know I'm 'bout to get her done
Pushin' all your buttons, you would think I had an extra thumb
Chug a fifth of moonshine, chase it with some Ketel One
Spit nice with raps to rip mics
Carry my whole state on my shoulders until my discs slip twice
I'll keep strivin' for the title until I win right
This is what happens when you feed Gizmo after midnight
A fuckin' Gremlin, ain't nobody stoppin' that
Cleats on my feet and I'm a play em like a soccer match
Slaughter all these copycats, you could never follow that
(Ground control to major Tom) I'm crazy do you roger that?

[Verse 2: D. Lector]
Eenie meenie miney mo, my weenie in your hiney hole
Hidey ho neighbor as I light the dro, psycho flow
I can go from high to low, low to high man I don't know
Too hot to touch, too cold to hold and right now I'm at 5 below
On the surface my mind's berserk, and I'm like give me a perc and a Vic
With the verse I write, each word is precise
Verbally nice, sharp as a surgical knife
For certain it's curtains, I'm the best you've heard in your life
Bourbon and Sprite, cause in the burbs we light the herb every night
Curlin' the mic, just warmin' up, so quit your queefin', it's girly
I'm eatin' 30, geeze it's early, walkin' all weekend like Bernie
I used to be weak and nerdy, now I'm Diesel like the type of fuel
Highway to hell, they didn't teach me this in drivin' school
You giant tool, I'm hittin' the track like Ricky Bobby
Listen mommy, if, if you with a pretty body, then shit I'll probably
Take brain, cause the kid's a zombie, never did karate
But it's Daniel-san, all I'm missin' is Mr. Miyagi
I'm fuckin' crazy, smellin' like a skunk with rabies
Punchin' babies, humpin' ladies, blame my mother cause she made me
I'm a product of the 80's, high as a kite, high on life
This rap shit is like ridin' a bike

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I'm Mr. Starship Trooper puttin' weed up in the hooka
Hittin' on my friends' moms, tryna take me home a cougar
In your dreams like Freddy Krueger with the lyrical maneuvers
YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, all up in your computer
I just live Hakuna Matata I'm kickin' it with Pumba lightin' Buddha
Stayin' flyer than you losers, Stella Luna
I'm a dude who got some confidence, scratch that, cockiness
Syllable after syllable out of my esophagus
You don't gotta roger that, but baby I'm a roger this
Mothafuckin' party boy, call me Chris Pontius
Bitch I'm just a jackass, higher than a rocket-ship
Your chick reverse cowboy's the only one on top of this
She like, let me pull it out so I can swallow it
Well, bitch you're sippin' greatness, you should spit it out and bottle it
The way you givin' brain you'll never get yourself a scholarship
In fact, at this point your fuckin' head's probably hollow bitch
I'm fuckin' nice so all you haters should acknowledge it
Either way, who gives a fuck? I'm makin' me a profit bitch
I got that molten lava flow, nobody hot as that
I'm the best in the burbs bitch, and you can roger that



[Intro-Chris Webby]
Yeah
Webby
It's that shit you just roll to, you know what I'm sayin'?
Hop in a whip and roll

[Hook-Chris Webby]
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
I ain't lookin' back
Still a kid at heart, ain't nobody changin' that
Got my mind on my money, but I still don't have a stack
I roll, I roll
Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at?
One day I'mma make it, so I wait until it's that
And when I get my turn, swear to god that it's a wrap
I roll, I roll

[Verse 1-Chris Webby]
Still like a kid but I'm newly 22 though
They know me as the chew from CT to Pluto
Walk around town, everybody givin' kudos
Michael Cera didn't hit it, I'm the one who banged Juno
I live life mucho bueno smash culo
Shows every week since I linked up with New York
Now I'm on that new flow
Doin' what I do bro
Buzz gettin' bigger than an uncut jewfro
Who knows I would achieve on this level
And prove my teachers wrong cause they said I was a rebel
Who never would amount to nothin' doin' what I want
Always showin' up to class smellin' like a fresh blunt
But I always had it in me, I just needed to apply myself
And rap's all I've ever loved, besides myself, huh
Maybe I'm a little cocky dude
But if you spit this tight then you'd be cocky too

[Hook-Chris Webby]
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
I ain't lookin' back
Still a kid at heart, ain't nobody changin' that
Got my mind on my money, but I still don't have a stack
I roll, I roll
Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at?
One day I'mma make it, so I wait until it's that
And when I get my turn, swear to god that it's a wrap
I roll, I roll

[Verse 2-Chris Webby]
I roll, roll like a Michelin
Everyday I get it in
Pop another ritalin, listenin'
I was a goofball, never the sober guy
Gettin' high, rollin' up J's playin' Golden Eye
Star Fox in a ship facin' Andross
Zelda, Ganondorf in a standoff
Battlin' with Bowser, fireball flower
Sittin' in front of my TV for hours
And though you grow up you still hang on to the past
Being young was a blast and you clean up your act
And try to make somethin' of it, don't listen to the haters
And if you got a passion, then you follow it if you love it
That's what I did and shit I'm alright
Still livin' with my parents but I'm livin' the life
I be wakin' up late, and I party all night
Cause I'm doin' what I love and the future looks bright

[Hook-Chris Webby]
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
I ain't lookin' back
Still a kid at heart, ain't nobody changin' that
Got my mind on my money, but I still don't have a stack
I roll, I roll
Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at?
One day I'mma make it, so I wait until it's that
And when I get my turn, swear to god that it's a wrap
I roll, I roll

[Verse 3-Chris Webby]
You can find me eatin' bacon grilled cheese with my grape juice
Donkey Kong in the flesh like the ape loose
Yeah that's fuckin' right, I could snuff a mic
Since I rode my dirty black and white rusted Huffy bike
Soon enough I'm in a two door drop
With a stack of money greener then a newport box
So I dare you to go and find a dude more hot
Buzzin' CT so big I made New York watch
Now everybody be recitin' all my raspy quotes
Of the skinny white boy with a scratchy throat
Now my mixtapes, everybody has it
Cuz in your iTunes got more Web than your attic does
Get it? Just nod if you follow me
You don't gotta like it, but if not just acknowledge me
I got an army of ninjas across the US
And I'm just doin' what I do best
Haha

[Hook-Chris Webby]
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
I ain't lookin' back
Still a kid at heart, ain't nobody changin' that
Got my mind on my money, but I still don't have a stack
I roll, I roll
Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at?
One day I'mma make it, so I wait until it's that
And when I get my turn, swear to god that it's a wrap
I roll, I roll



[Intro]
It's been a long time
Long time
It's been a long time
Been a long time comin'

[Verse 1]
Baby, I've been speaking my mind
Since Ocarina of Time
Dropped on Nintendo 64 but steadily on my grind
I've been building my kingdom, a couple G's at a time
'Til I cop a villa sittin' on a beach with a dime
Sour D and some wine, that why my livin' is right
Until then, get up out of my way or you'll be dinner tonight
There were days I wanted to quit and live a simpler life
But then the beat in my head bangs and I pick up that mic
Yeah, I represent for that nerd life
And I been a monster, you hear right
When the moons out, I'm a werewolf
So you better go get them search lights
Got a mean bark, and a firm bite
And a weed spark, and like errnight
I been on my mission so now I am takin' the title like it is my birth right
I deserve my time with that fuckin' rock
To go juggernaut, flip it up a notch
I got no brakes, and I'm runnin' stops (Tires screech)
So get out my way or get fuckin' squashed
I'm a grown man, with a cup of scotch
Puffin' pot, with southern rock
With a hippie chick, that fucks a lot
And lovin's what I got, (What I got)
See I got the sauce motherfucker
I ain't perfect but I work with my flaws, motherfucker
I'ma king up in a world full of pawn motherfuckers
An artist to the end, Bob Ross, motherfucker

[Chorus]
I'm just warmin' up and they label me a veteran
Rookie of the year, when I started I was peddlin'
These CD's out my truck, speakers louder than a elephant
It's been a long time, long time
Okay, I'm just warmin' up and they label me a veteran
Rookie of the year, when I started I was peddlin'
These CD's out my truck, speakers louder than a elephant
It's been a long time, It's been a long time comin'

[Verse 2]
I'm a mix of Ferris Bueller, with a little Garry Cooper
As I'm researchin' conspiracy theories on my computer
Glasses on like Uncle Jr droppin' shit for my consumers
With a cougar who can tutor on Kama Sutra maneuvers
Fuck the Romans, I'm a super human, music spewin' veteran
Megazord assemblin', Timberlands and a letterman
I'm colder than the set of The Revenant, when I get it in
Settlin', perfect specimen, let me in
2009 and I'm still that shit
Get on stage and I kill that shit
If your a little bit literate, literally you can feel that shit
And that's brick by brick
No manual, no plan at all, I had to build that shit (Had to build that shit)
But I'm an animal, I kept standing tall, and I did that shit
On top, like bald spots
Make jaws drop, no bad business
Got the formula, in my palm watch
You think I'm cheatin' on math quizzes
And that crosswalk, all my dogs barkin' at mad bitches
'Til my heart stops, got no soft spot for these rap critics, I'm back in it
And I still got my entree comin'
Young baller, out Connecticut like Andre Drummond
Feel that typhoon comin', when that white dude dunkin'
Guarantee you might lose somethin'

[Chorus]
I'm just warmin' up and they label me a veteran
Rookie of the year, when I started I was peddlin'
These CD's out my truck, speakers louder than a elephant
It's been a long time, long time
Okay, I'm just warmin' up and they label me a veteran
Rookie of the year, when I started I was peddlin'
These CD's out my truck, speakers louder than a elephant
It's been a long time, It's been a long time comin'

[Outro]
I'm just warmin' up and they label me a veteran
Rookie of the the year, when I started I was peddlin'
These CD's out my truck, speakers louder than a elephant
Yeah



[Intro]
Here's my story, it's sad but true
Yeah right, You see I love women, but I can't pick just one
And like, I'm sure I'll settle down one day
But I'm young, right? I'm just tryn to have a good time
Living in the moment and whatnot, you can call me a dog
But everybody else calls me Chris Webby, hehe nahmean?

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
It's seems like every week I get some girlie's number in my phone
Bring her home, make her scream, make her yell, make her moan
I'm a dog always lookin' for somewhere to put a bone
On my Entourage shit, bitches lookin' like Sloane
I'm an animal, off the chain, I had to cut loose
And judging on how you're dressed, you're tryin to fuck boo
You'll never hear me utterin' about I love you
I just really want to see them panties drop into your Ugg boots
It ain't my fault, your girlfriend sweats me
She'll be gettin' back to you, right after she's left me
And I ain't puttin' rose petals on your bed sheets
Romance ain't my thing, you should've known that when you met me
Am what I am, and I'll be it to my death
Got a thing for brunettes, with tats, and big breasts
So if you at the plate don't worry, who's on deck
Hate the game, not the player, Ma
And then she make me say

[Hook]
Woah oh.. (repeat)

[Verse 2; Chris Webby]
You see my life’s good, where it ought to be
All I gotta do is spit game and slaughter beats
And I know you’ll probably tell your whole sorority
Just don’t expect my phone to answer when you’re callin' me
I’m a son of a gun, check the paternity test
Always chuggin' on a 40 and burnin' the best
Unzipperin' your jeans while you kiss on my neck
Oh you’re a good girl? psh, then it’s on to the next
I like a bad chick, just give her the chance
While I try to figure out how you fit in those pants
Cause I’m partial to any exotic biddie
Lookin' like Mila Kunis in Forgettin' Sarah Marshall
On the road every night, it’s unique
Saw you right across the party and I like what I see
Oh you’re daddy’s little girl? well tonight you a freak
She grab my hand and brought me right upstairs
And then she make me say

[Hook]



Read Chris Webby's Explanation "Sativa"
[Hook: Zacari]
Roll that heady
Fill my Chevy with the vapors
AK-47 in them double wide papers
So I break up half and save the rest of it for later
So come and get in touch with nature 'cos, baby, you know we smoking that sativa
We smoking that sativa
We smoking that...

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
This shit is sublime
Hit it and lift up your mind
The most specific of kinds
Particular strains I'm smoking during daytime
Got me feeling high and energetic at the same damn time
I'm on a path to where I don't know
With a little bit of Jack Herer in my bowl
Euphoric, yo, with the Oreos
And whatever other snacks I carried back home
Got the Tangie from my Cypress Hill Family
In high demand the types of strands
Dispensaries be selling out like they be supplying the kids candy
High as Iron-Man with 90 grams
And, yo, this weed here ain't no runner up
This weed won the cup
Enough's enough, we puffin' tough
My blunt is stuffed with Thunderfuck
Like I'm purposely trying to disobey Scruff Mcgruff
'Cos this Silver Haze will leave you lit for days
And this shit's amazing
Zoned out playing Ninja Gaiden
Joystick's engaging, Taking a rip and flaming
The Canadian fragrance blazing
And it's chased with a great sensation
Don't change the station ehh
My brain's on a paid vacation
With sativa in my vehicle, chiefin'
Turn up the speakers
The green is my teacher
Like Yoda leading Jedi procedures

[Hook: Zacari]
Roll that heady
Fill my Chevy with the vapors
AK-47 and them double wide papers
So I break off half and save the rest of it for later
So come and get in touch with nature 'cos, baby, you know we smoking that sativa

[Verse 2: Demrick]
I spend my days in a daze smoking Lemon Haze
Out in Amsterdam where women love to entertain
The Greenhouse Coffee Shop the red light
When I'm in Holland that's the spot I go to get right
Roll my weed up, smoke sativa kick my feet up
Look for tracks that I can eat up when I heat up it's a fever
And my stoner chick's a diva, all I feed her is that greenery
Raw papers wrapped around that Sour D
And this life ain't want it seem to be
It's something like a dream to me
This weed'll it give me energy
Best believe my enemies, they don't last long
Joints getting ashed then passed to a sad song
I remember not knowing 'bout the different strains
Copping dimes out in the projects in the pouring rain
Now I hit up the dispensary they know the name for smoking on that fire flame
You know this shit is not a game
And that raspberry cough in my bag's very strong
Hotbox, you won't last very long
See the smoke through the glass of the bong
Take a hit, hold on, don't pass 'till it's gone
Play this track watch my fans sing along
Boy, we lit, yeah, we high, man, we on
Blazing Acapulco Gold
With my partners getting stoned
It's sativa man, straight to the dome

[Hook: Zacari]
Roll that heady

[Verse 3: B-Real]
I ain't smoking that bullshit
Let me tell what I don't do
I ain't smoking that bullshit
Let me tell you what I won't do
I ain't smoking that bullshit
Let me tell what I don't do (no)
I ain't smoking that bullshit
Let me tell you what I won't do
Pass this shit
'Cos it's boo boo
Backyard boogie we don't touch
But I heard you do
Fucking cursed like it's voodoo
You could see me takin' flight on that jet fuel
And we blowin' sativa on the next two
Getting so elevated that we forget you
Faded with Webby on the set, fool
No matter how many requests we don't accept you
Better be taking it to the chest, fool
No stress, it's all incredible
I be putting you out with an edible
Laid out, nigga blazed out, let me fade out, feeling played out, hey now
How many hits can you take now?
How many hits 'fore you break down?
How many minutes go by you say you feeling fake now?
How many swirls you got wrapped around the jay now?

[Hook: Zacari]

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Now please don’t believe what you see on TV
The chains and the vehicles these MCs be
Puttin’ in they videos seem all steazy
But seem is the key word there, believe me
It’s all just smoke and mirrors, shit ain’t what it appears
Rental chains along with the gold veneers
Just so it’s clear, car they whippin’ on screen, that ain’t what they drove in here
In the crib like they own that shit
Throwin’ bread around like they made all that money
While they actin’ like a pimp ‘round all these chicks
But every model on set been paid to act slutty
So ain’t all that funny? Now you all know
That everything that glitter ain’t gold
And every rapper sayin’ that they spendin’ that dough
Are only doin’ so until it gets repoed
Say it ain’t so

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Say it ain’t so, showin’ y’all if you ain’t know
Woah, say it ain’t so, everything that glitter ain’t gold
Woah, say it ain’t so, tellin’ you the way shit go
Woah, say it ain’t so, everything that glitter ain’t gold

[Verse 2: Sap]
I be, crack a lash at you frauds on IG
First class combo, but you fly cheap
So why is you talkin’ fly to me?
I’m way ahead of you and walkin’ out of reach of them short arms
You can’t touch me, it must be ugly to see me up and living lovely
You rusty, might need to do new tools
We controllin’ the game, I’m talkin’ voodoo crew
I got a chance to peep under your hood, it wasn’t good
Say it ain’t so, yo’ fans just ain’t know
It’s so many places that you can’t go
Even when you grew up, damn, I thought you blew up
Guess you ain’t got the respect you said you had
Shittin’ on all of the people who fed your ass
Get a look in the mirror and never knowin’ what’s next
You made cash but your soul is in debt
Help me say it ain’t so

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Say it ain’t so, showin’ y’all if you ain’t know
Woah, say it ain’t so, everything that glitter ain’t gold
Woah, say it ain’t so, tellin’ you the way shit go
Woah, say it ain’t so, everything that glitter ain’t gold

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
Bottles, bitches, lobster dinners
Multi-million dollar villas
Whips and diamonds, lots of scrilla
Photoshoppin’, crop it bigga
Racks all wrapped in rubber bands
Pinky rings on both they hands
Private jet to a crib on the sand
Till they get the knock from that repo man
Say it ain’t so

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Say it ain’t so, showin’ y’all if you ain’t know
Woah, say it ain’t so, everything that glitter ain’t gold
Woah, say it ain’t so, tellin’ you the way shit go
Woah, say it ain’t so, everything that glitter ain’t gold, woah



[Intro]
Da, da da da, da
Da, da da da, da

[Hook]
I’ve got my seat leaned back, keep my tires looking clean
Rolling with the baddest bitches that you ever seen
Always rock my brim low, cause we rolling up the green
Getting screwed up, you know what I mean, mean, mean!
Sipping on my drink, drink, fill another cup
Then I'm rolling up the dank, dank
Twist another dutch, dutch
Shorty what you think, think we don’t give a fuck
Cause I’m always screwed, always screwed, always screwed up!
Let’s go!

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Back on the mic with the shit I say
We popping off!
And I been going through at least a couple grams a day
Drinking up like Mazel Tov
Cause you know we gon' ball, young entrepreneur
My money long
If I start to run low, then I go back out on tour
Voila! Problem solved, no schedule
I just relax with a weed sack, while my cheese stack cause I run this shit
If I see that, then I need that
Hear me baby girl? Get on your knee caps and suck my dick
'bout to relapse from the pills I get
Blue ones, white ones, purple too
('bout to relapse from the pills I get)
And it puts me in the perfect mood!
Yeah, ooh, (oooh), now I’m feeling too good to move
Everything I’m hearing is chopped and screwed
Rolling in my Chevy when I’m cruising through
Vroom! All black, from the tires to the rims to the paint to the tints
Fire when I spit, put the flame to your bitch when I’m lighting up a spliff then I came on her tits
Shit! See, Webby is a nasty dude with a raspy voice
Cause I burn so much, but my mom still proud
Every time I come around she’s like, "that’s my boy"
Get up on the beat and the track’s destroyed
It is what it is and it is what it be
Webster is the baddest, boy!
You get me screwed up, just follow me!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Get up on a beat like, “bitch, what’s up?”
Every single day I’m getting loose
Got a mixture in my solo cup
So loud, got a subwoofer tied to the roof
Rhymin the truth with a fine little sloot
Hitting more hoes than young Shia LaBeouf
Money on my mind, yeah, money on my mind
Trying to get some pesos on my grind for the loot
I’mma go getter, flow spitter, ho hitter
Surrounded by trees like gorillas
Webby cold to the bone, don’t shiver
Made it this far, now I’m trying to go bigger!
Andre the giant, dropping the finest
Mix tapes, but the game cannot define it
Don’t know whether or not to co-sign it
Because I’m different, fuck if y'all don’t like it!
B-B-B-B-bitch! Yeah, we’ll be head tripping!
I’m about to lose my shit, wait til them meds kick in!
I’m a Doberman Pinscher, y'all just some whack kittens
My bitches look like models, yours look like Meg Griffin
Check out my cat scan, that shit says that I’m out of my mind
I’m just a mad man, rolling up like an ounce at a time
Hitting the club and I bounce with a dime
But only show up for a drink and a song or two
And now that I’m on, all you haters are mad I'm doin what I said I was gonna do

[Hook]



[Hook: Stacey Michelle & Chris Webby]
I’ve got screws loose, I don’t choose to
So lock me in that bubble room because I’m cuckoo
I’ve got screws loose (No control of my demons, and no control of my actions, and no control over anything that I said)
Said I’ve got screws loose (Lost my marbles, have you seen ‘em? ‘Cause everybody be tellin’ me I’m simply not right in the fuckin’ head)

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Welcome to the Homegrown grow-op
Started single player, now it’s Sap on the co-op
Fully high-tech, my brain like iRobot
Straightjacket on, lightin’ bogs on the stove top
Roll through the road blocks, you know it’s on again
So grab the Adderall, the Molly and Klonopin
I’m ‘bout to sip this bottle of whiskey like Ray Donovan
And spit my ass off until I’m runnin’ outta oxygen
I’m like Trevor up in Grand Theft Auto Five
That’s why I laugh when people ask me if I bought this ride
Bitch I pulled the driver out and blew his brains across the side
Walked, then ran him over like a couple dozen times
Then I crushed his spine, bloody tire tracks up in the mud behind
The whip, so fuck a wanted star I’m way too hard to come and find
Roll up in a shady alley, park the car and duck and hide
Bitch I’m out my motherfucking mind

[Hook: Stacey Michelle & (Chris Webby)]
I’ve got screws loose, I don’t choose to
So lock me in that bubble room because I’m cuckoo
I’ve got screws loose (No control of my demons, and no control of my actions, and no control over anything that I said)
Said I’ve got screws loose (Lost my marbles, have you seen ‘em? ‘Cause everybody be tellin’ me I’m simply not right in the fuckin’ head)

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Scruffy and unshaven, up till the sun’s raisin’
In a Concord, with Mayor Rob Ford, some drugs taken
And a bottle later we doin’ donuts on fresh pavement
And behavin’ like I’m star in a movie by Wes Craven
Shit I’m crazy, just sayin’, fuck it actually I’m Super Saiyan
Fuckin’ rampagin’ till the pages in the news are sayin’
Webby’s on the loose and they gon’ put me in a noose
But I’ll survive and spend the next couple months just fuckin’ recuperatin’
Out on a deserted Virgin Island where the birds are flyin’ overhead
As I plot my revenge with all the words I’m rhymin’
You can’t defeat me, I don’t know why all you nerds are tryin’
If you heard that I was quittin’, someone in your circle’s lyin’
Shit I’d rather catch a flight from Malaysia
And sit middle seat between a couple guys in Al-Qaeda
Durin’ a fuckin’ ice storm in the middle of night, yo
Get the picture? Ain’t no chance of me lettin’ the mic go

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
They could lock me in the looney bin
But I’ll break free and end up on the fuckin’ loose again
They call me crazy, howlin’ at the moon again
Until I wake up in that padded rubber room again

[Hook: Stacey Michelle & Chris Webby]
I’ve got screws loose, I don’t choose to
So lock me in that bubble room because I’m cuckoo
I’ve got screws loose (No control of my demons, and no control of my actions, and no control over anything that I said)

[Hook]
We the illest around, and ain't nobody gon' see me
Ain't nobody gon' see me, ain't nobody gon' see me
Burn this bitch to the ground, cause ain't nobody gon' see me
Ain't nobody gon' see me, ain't nobody gon' see me now

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You couldn't see me with your contacts in
Walk by, bitches yelling out like "Oh My God that's him!"
Mwahaha, so come here you little groupie
That's why I'm always chillin' with a bird like Snoopy
I got my wood stocked, I am rappin' cooked rock
Spitting crack, bring it back, doing things you could not
Burn a bag of good pot, let it lean, let it rock
CT, where you at, got my region on lock
Beam me up, Spock, to the top of this
Can't see me, see a fuckin' optometrist
I show dominance, you better grab your bifocals
Then you see me kill it with the vocals, local
Hometown hero got the internet buzzing like a vibrator
Haters see you later, no discussion
Got percussion in my bloodline, music in my heartbeat
Money in my mind, Steve Nash couldn't guard me
Hardly famous, well maybe on Facebook
Friend request healthy ass every single day, look
Rap's Dane Cook, one liners got 'em shook
Fly as Peter Pan man, but I'm a captain like Hook
Rap and I took everything that is around you
Leave 'em looking like a damn Velicoraptor found you
Simply, sickly, somebody hit me
So cool I'm frozen in time like Walt Disney
Drink til I'm dizzy, and steadily burning
Anybody dumb enough to battle Webby will learn
That they can step in and step out, meeting adjourned
Ask Rafiki he'll tell you that the king has returned

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Googie GoHard]
It's Googie GoHard and I came to bless the track
Grooving with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Rapper
We chopping who can not see, an Inglorious Bastard
The flow has been mastered, I'll even spit it backwards
You don't want the raw meats, you don't want the raw eat
You don't wanna spark too many punches in the raps
Homie you ain't on my level anyway you spelling that
It's a tad in the bag from the gift of the gab
Ah man, this kid is unbelievable
Even B.I.G. woulda say I'm something he ain't seen before
He would blow, speaking shows, scheming when I'm even low
I ain't tryna battle homie, I'm just tryna see the dough
Nah, it ain't conceited yo, maybe just a little bit
Hope you got binoculars, and if you do then riddle me this
How you gon' see something that you know yourself don't even exist
I lickety Split, now go to the middle and watch me just fill it with piff
Can't see, Webby or Googie GoHard
You can't see us, how you gon' see
I'mso mean in my B-Boy lean
You're gonna need a telescope to see these stars gleam
CT all the way to the dirty Jersey
Yeah muhfucka, you heard me
We burn trees like arsonists, you don't wanna bark to this
Can't see the flow then you better get your goggles bitch

[Hook]

Untame on the mic, the dangerous type
And this is real life, it ain’t just the way that I write
We can pour a drink, roll that mary jane up and light
So baby come to Webby’s world, I’ll make you famous tonight
Place your bets y'all gon' pay it in full
Never graduated from school but I made it this cool
Now I’m here motherfucker, ain’t no April fools
Right to the top like I’m defying gravitational pull
Cause I started young but I’m older now
Learned a lot up in the game, got a doper sound
Travelling around the world, getting cultured now
But still rolling with my dogs when I’m homeward bound
When I see Sap at the back of the weed spot
We gon get so fucking high that we pass it to Ewok
Then we turn it up so loud that the back of your seat rocks
From the very second that the beat drops

[Hook]
I’m about to set it off, yo, ready, set, go
If you tryna get it cracking let me know!
I’m about to set it off, whoa, bitches getting low
They be sweating when I be walking through the door
I’m about to set it off

[Verse 2]
Stay writing while rhyming and stage diving
All in, going so hard I could break diamonds
I been patiently waiting but learned that it takes time
And now I got the same look in my eye as a caged lion
I been on my hustle why the fuck you think I’m doing this?
Book of rhymes thicker than a Tarantino movie script
Rolling up a doobie and we jumping in the Uber whip
Until the driver take me to the top, I’m bout to do this shit
So animated, call me Bugs Bunny
Since I used to battle cats for they lunch money
Always had the same clothes, looking duck funny
Straight dummy but Webby was never dumb, buddy
I knew I’d have my moment, so let me soak it in
With your chick and, uh, some of her closest friends
‘Cause they know it now if they didn’t know it then
Now it’s time to let the show begin!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah I’m about to set if off
Yeah I’m about to set if off
Yeah I’m about to set if off
Yeah I’m about to set if off



[Intro: Chris Webby]
Put your controllers in the air
Haha, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Call of Duty, online, baby, let's get it poppin'
They try to step to me with the head shot got 'em
I'm something like the best at a Team Deathmatch
Rusher of the Middle East, take it to the next map
Dope attacks to blow your back with
A natural born Soap MacTavish
Scope and blast it
It won't be an open casket, don't care
There ain't no love this is Modern Warfare

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Because I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
None of you motherfuckers want war with me
Because I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
Xbox to the PS3
Because I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
Head-shot from the sniper rifle, MG
Because I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
Murking all you bitches in that COD

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
You couldn't see me with a UAV
Or a heartbeat sensor on your SMG
It's COD, and see you could never stop me
Dropping competition like a fucking Nazi Zombie
I'm cocky, ain't nobody messing when he's on
I'm the reason you're whole team is getting respawned
Your a pawn, get powned when I come attack with
My bluetooth in ear, always talking mad shit
Flashbang grenades and knife 'em all day
PS3 to Xbox, can't stay away
BANG, then I put another in your brain
Burn these motherfuckers with the napalm flame
And then I

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Because I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
None of you motherfuckers want war with me
Because I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
Xbox to the PS3
Because I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
Head-shot from the sniper rifle, MG
Because I shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, WHAT!
Murking all you bitches in that COD

[Outro: Chris Webby]
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up



[Verse 1]
I’ve been stuck underground, but now it’s my time
Time to take flight, right in to the skyline
Off to beautiful women sippin’ on fine wine
Up at the stadium where the lights lime
And I’m, movin’ way past sound check
Still lookin’ for a life that I ain’t found yet
Round trip on a magical school bus
Before we touch down, shit they already knew us
Made it from the bottom to professionally rappin’
While they were tellin’ me that it was never gonna happen
Now it’s funny to see the haters’ reactions
Cause they ain’t sayin' a word, Charlie Chaplin
I’m back in this bitch relaxin’
Put in the groundwork now it’s time to cash in
Heh, and everybody knows I earned that
Headed to the skyline, feet up, first class
Yeah!

[Hook]
I don’t know about you but I know one thing
I ain’t gonna wait around here to make it
Anybody with a dream got to feel the same
If it ain’t given to me then I’ma take it
So let me just
Fly fly, fly fly
Cuz they tellin’ me it’s my time
Fly fly, fly fly
And disappear into the skyline

[Verse 2]
Spit the toughest shit, who touchin’ this?
Always chillin’ with a bird, Snuffaluffagus
And I’m lovin’ it, no Mickey D’s
Just Colt 45 and some piffy trees
Jeeze, got my boardin' pass ready
I’m headin' to the top, they ain’t gettin' past Webby
Yeah, been on the grind since 8th grade
Went from gettin' no girls to bangin' Playmates
Heh, what up Ms. November?
My flight’s taking off, got my shit together
Ready for whatever, do it better than before
I’m the reason my competitors are headin’ for the door
Cause I’m deadly and I’m raw with the mic tonight
Got the cameras all flashin’ like a lightning' strike
Heh, I’m on another altitude
And they ain’t ready for the shit that I’m about to do

[Hook: Chris Webby]

[Verse 3]
If you got a dream you should follow it
Cause not everybody’s capable of keepin' straight A’s for a scholarship
As a kid no one could figure me out
So I would like to thank Hofstra for kickin' me out
And look at me now, I’m doin' pretty well for my age
Considerin' two years ago I was makin' minimum wage
Heh, and now we doin' okay, Skyline-flow, up, up and away
Heh, and I ain’t lookin' for a handout
Shit I got the fans now, mothafuckers stand down
Live my life to a whole new beat
Finally standin' on my own two feet
Cause it got that tough, been kicked while I was down
But I never gave in, and I got back up
Yup, gettin' close, well I better be
But all I see is the skyline ahead of me

[Hook]



[Verse 1: ANoyd]
Yeah, you can name anybody, I can make a fool out of
'Cause I'm off E now, Absolute Vodka
And ya girl in the car man
And she getting electrocute carmen
Electrocute, cute in the red suit
We in route by it
Where we at
You can't take train to be here
Start you can chew to chew chew when the Chewbacca
Still got the first rap that I wrote memorized
And I know that combination in my school locker
Wait, yeah, that's high school days
The I really really wish I could recycle days
The generation either it could go two ways
The Triple H shit or Shawn Michaels' leg
Yeah, and it's really no surprise, ya'll upset me before
I got slept on the floor, so I speak for the broke
Like the Wi-fi bad, I connect to the port
Yeah, giving thanks everyday that I'm not dead
You can't evaluate a word that was not said
Bumping in the cornballs outta nowhere
I been running through nothing
Corns and the cobwebs
You know I back it up every time that I talk shit
If rap had a page, I would be the default pic
Convention with a sword and I caught me a swordfish
And when ANoyd here, man, it's really important

[Chorus: Jitta On The Track]
I was jaded now I'm swerving in my lane
Gasolina by the liter in my tank
So I, so I pass the leader, Mama Mia, it's my race, ya
So I pump my breaks, ya, so I pump my breaks, ya
Slow the fuck, slow the fuck down
Slow the fuck, slow the fuck down
Slow the fuck, slow the fuck down
Slow the fuck, slow the fuck down
Hey yo (Select your player)

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
V-12 in that framework
While I blaze purp, I'ma claim turf
See I'm in the lead, no catching me
Y'all slow as Lil Yachty's brain works
With a blue shell you got one shot
If you mess with Christian, I'ma catch you slippin'
Got banana peels in my glove box
Windows down and them subs knock
My dude AG got the Midas touch
My oil good and my tires tough
Hit the boost button, now I'm fired up
Y'all gone lose something if you try your luck
I'm eco friendly in a Beamer, Bentley or a Benz
Puttin' that dro in the wind
Trick Daddy in a sick Cadi' on rims
Don't make me do it again
Show 'em daily like I'm Trevor Noah
I just rev the motor, then I'm gettin' over
Run the competition in my pole position
Ain't no hopes of winnin', so just taker it slower
Ain't no baking soda, I'm that raw coke
No cuts in 'em, this is all dope
Don't listen to none of them laws, no
Hit the road like Grand Theft Auto

[Chorus: Jitta On The Track]
I was jaded now I'm swerving in my lane
Gasolina by the liter in my tank
So I, so I pass the leader, Mama Mia, it's my race, ya
So I pump my breaks, ya, so I pump my breaks, ya
Slow the fuck, slow the fuck down
Slow the fuck, slow the fuck down
Slow the fuck, slow the fuck down
Slow the fuck, slow the fuck down



[Produced By: SAP]

[Hook]
I came to pass the blunt around (blunt around)
I fuck around (fuck around)
Pour up a full cup and chug it down
Homie that was yesterday (yesterday), so they wonder how (wonder how)
I can do this every single time I come around
But it’s so eazy when you’re W-E-B-B-Y
Eazy when you’re W-E-B-B-Y
Eazy when you’re W-E-B-B-Y
Eazy when you’re W-E-B-B-Y

[Verse 1]
Yeah I’m puffing loud, got me buzzing now
I’m just trying to do some shit that makes my mother proud
Live from the underground, met with all the labels
And they said I could make a million dollars if I dumbed it down
But I said “fuck that!” I’ma do it Web’s way
‘Cause I’m fucking dope, well at least that’s what my friends say
Lyrically a sensei, muy caliente, comprende?
Thursday to Wednesday I be so crazy
It’s not what I try for but it’s my business
Homie you should mind yours
I couldn’t lose my mind more
Jumping out the window on the 9th floor
Now they’re saying they gotta send me to the psych ward
Straightjacketed, a battle it ain’t happenin’
That be like seeing Drake and Rampage in a cage match
And I’ve been put up on this planet to ramble and raise havoc
With a bottle and an eighth a day habit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
-O-U-N-G veteran, everytime I’m stepping in
Cold as the toes of a penguin
Bad to my skeleton, bad to the bone as I’ve ever been
Feet up on the throne that I’ve settled in
Running off of adrenaline and unprescribed medicine
Lighting up an L again and hit it til my head’ll spin
Started with a crumpled up Lincoln and now it’s Benjamins
Used to be a loser but now the world is watching Webby win
It’s so easy, veni, vidi, vici
Young Houdini, rabbit in my three piece
Used to be on YouTube, now I’m up on TV
Everybody spell it out, it’s W-E-B
Add another B-Y, you’re about to see why
I’m a giant, start my sentences with “fee-fi”
Fo fum, go dumb, putting work in
So it’s time you met the man behind the curtain

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Killin’ this game since it ain’t love us
I do it so easy, it ain’t nothing, I tell em it ain’t nothing
I see you dropped your new shit but it ain’t buzzin’
I’m killing this game since it ain’t love us
I do it so easy, it ain’t nothing
I tell em it ain’t nothing, I tell em it ain’t nothing

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
So fly, so fly, so fly, yeah
I'm so fly that it's dangerous
Rocking the ear flaps with a handkerchief
Always stay around trees like I'm Ranger Rick
Load up the cloud pen and then I take a rip
Ya girl's favorite like Yankovic, I'm weird as well
Your opinion doesn't affect me you could clearly tell
Living life to the fullest while I'm here
And when the end's near, I just hope they serve beer in Hell
But uh, I ain't worried 'bout the fire and brimstone
‘Cause that's a fair trade for the life that I live, Holmes
Feet up on the street, it's like I'm riding with Flintstones
Gotta stay grounded when you fly as I've been, yo
So much drink I need a extra thermos
So cold I better get a furnace, yeah
Tattoos cover up my epidermis
On my grind until I get it perfect, bitch

[Hook: Alandon]
I'm so high, you could think I'm upside down
I'm so alive, could feel my heart pump right now
I'm so fly, I could never touch back down
I'm so fly, I
I'm so high, you could think I'm upside down
I'm so alive, could feel my heart pump right now
I'm so fly, I could never touch back down
I'm so fly, I

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Webby's back just like a spinal cord
More wacks than a vinyl store
See I keep a good vibe until it's time for war
And when it is, kid, you better find a sword
A samurai at core, my Camaro like the Trojan horse
You gon' see an army role out when we open doors
Like I walked the fucking plank, I'm going overboard
Holy Lord, crazy's what they know me for
I'm a, fresh dude in a pair of Reeboks
So fly that when I look down, I stare at treetops
I'm uh, high as knee socks, started with a beatbox
Now I'm on these stages, show the whole world how we rock
Baby call me Fiat, I'm speeding through the left lane
Alien mindset, the brain up in my head is Krang
Let it rain, let it pour, verbally I steady aim
Mic in hand, I'm accurate as Jesse James, bang

[Hook: Alandon]
I'm so high, you could think I'm upside down
I'm so alive, could feel my heart pump right now
I'm so fly, I could never touch back down
I'm so fly, I
I'm so high, you could think I'm upside down
I'm so alive, could feel my heart pump right now
I'm so fly, I could never touch back down
I'm so fly, I



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Webby hit them in the head with it, until they lose their motor skills
Constantly confronting my lyricism and flowing ill
Now they know the deal, crushing shit, clover field
Rappers need to get their weight up cause they’re looking Jonah Hill
Compose the real, there ain’t no slim fast here
And Poland Spring is what I bring, cause I can spit that clear
Shout to Jude and Lord Sear, all out to their speakers
Making real rap music, they singing with Justin Bieber
It’s a shame, everyone on the radio sound the same
One more person rhyming model with bottle I go insane
All these bullshit club records with they autotune and dance moves
Everybody selling now, but that’s the shit I can’t do
What up P, Queens to CT
Let me show ‘em how we do it in the 203
Shout to Apathy any other real people doing it
My chips are all in, move or lose it for the music, yeah
Bowser's back chillin' where the sour's at
Went against the odds and rose above and shit, I’m proud of that
Kicking flows on my tekken shit
Rapping superpower stronger than the X-Men, bitch, yeah (GANGSTA)
Oh, you shook once you fall back
Fight night, fall, get your jaw cracked
We keep it infamous, and making punk rappers dig a ditch and bury their careers
Cause these rap game, we’re built for this!

[Hook Ft: Prodigy]
Rapping out of control, these rappers is slow
I got the permanent flow, I’m stuck in this zone
I’m so fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
I keep it so fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
Rapping out of control, these rappers is slow
I got the permanent flow, I’m stuck in this zone
I’m so fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
I keep you so fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Rap God, my balls are that hard
My blood is that frosty, cold is up north
In the mountains and college doing sex on a bar
Like two hoodies on, it’s freezing, I’m charged
My adrenaline pumping, and it’s keeping me warm
I got so many plans in my head, it’s keeping me going
Cause I know the other side of these barb wire fencing
It’s a whole world out there for me to just dig in
And eat like a runaway slave
These cotton picking bitches, trying to get me for my pay
Listen, I am not the idiot nigga, I am not the ???, ho
I kill your perm though, and let the third go
When a rapper try to stunt on me
Yo, Webby, get ‘em, School these youngins' who the fuck I be (I got you)
You can’t put pimp in a box
You can pigeonhole me, I do what I want
MC ??? is with fat laces, sneaker king bitch, nice pair of Asics
While you at home, plugged it to the Matrix
Me and C-Web get bread in real life, take a pic
Cause I stay PIF and they need to go shopping when they see my fresh
It’s like this nig, it’s like that rat
None of ya’ll better ever try to act like you that ill

[Hook]

[During and after hook outro: Prodigy]
When ya'll gonna learn
Everybody ain't got it
Please, check our résumés
Webby, yeah my nigga
Aye yo my nigga J-Cash told me
Fuck a intro
It's betta to tell um to fuck off at the end of the song
So fuck off, nigga
Bitch ass niggas
Broke ass rappers
Wanna-be celebrities
But you'll never be nothin' like Chris Webby and Dom P
Uhh, it's like that nigga



[Intro]
Destiny has a funny way
When it comes and takes all your cares away (Yeah!)
I can't think of a single thing
Other than what a beautiful state I'm in (Yeah, I'm feeling lucky)
Cause the world's still spinnin' round
(It goes round and round, It goes round and round, and it goes...)
Ooooh, I don't feel like coming down
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
What's up lil mama? Listen to me
There's something about you, something different to me
And I know there's plenty of fish in the sea. It's gigantic
You lookin' for a good time? Ma I am it
It's going down like the damn Titanic
Tan skin, lookin' Italian or Hispanic
Damn it, so dope, dudes can't stand it
Every guy hitting on her walking 'round campus
Book bag over the shoulder, fresh Nikes
Stepped to the girl, cause I heard that she liked me
She started smiling, I ain't even gotta ask her why
I just said, "I'm Webby, you might know me as that rapper guy
But you're fly, whatcha doin' tonight?
Oh, you're going to Jeff's party? Word, alright."
She wrote her number down on a little piece of paper
And I was like, "No doubt, I'mma catch you later."

[Hook: Kylie Minogue]
What on earth am I meant to do?
In this crowded place there is only you
Was gonna leave, now I have to stay
You have taken my breath away

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Went home, took a shower, layed down to rest
Woke up, threw a fitted on, super fresh
9 o'clock rolled around, hit mami with a text
She said she was pregaming and to meet her at Jeff's
So I cop a couple forties and went over to Lavodi's
Drank with a OZ and dank to blow trees
Only had a 10 spot, 5 for a cup
And 5 to throw down on someone else's dutch
Hopped in the whip and rolled right on over
Someone else driving cause neither one of us sober
Rolled up to the spot then walked to the backyard
Mad chicks, yo this shit was poppin'

A whole lot of girls: many different options
But I saw the chick from before and I locked in
Hit the keg and filled myself a cup
And then I put my brim low and went to say what's up

[Hook: Kylie Minogue]

We talked for a little bit, joked around
I could tell that in a little it was goin' down
I could see it in her eyes. She could see it in mine
I gave her my ten cents, told her she was a dime
She grabbed around my waist and she looked me in the face
And said, "We should go and find a private place."
And I was like, "Word, sounds great to me."
She grabbed my hand, don't know where she's takin' me
But I don't really care yo, what can I say?
Gave my man Lavodi dap and was on my way
She brought me upstairs, went into Jeff's room
Undress quick, know we havin' sex soon

She asked me if I had a condom
I looked in my wallet like, "Yo thank God I got one."
Then we got the bedroom shakin'
Noise so loud, they could hear it in the basement
What

[Bridge: Kylie Minogue]
Ooooh, is the world still spinning around (spinnin' around)?
Ooooh, I don't feel like coming down (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Outro: Kylie Minogue]
It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking too
It's no surprise (and that right there)
I don't want you to leave me (...is a college success story)
I want to make it with you
It's in your eyes (Yeah)



[Verse 1]
Lately I've been contemplating
Watching humans tear apart this fucking planet
Like they've never heard of moderation
The people running things ain't worried bout no conservation
Unless there's money in the conversation
But what happens when the soil is too toxic for the plants to grow
And all our drinking water is polluted (got the answer bro?)
All I know is humans are the cancer of the planet, yo
Forecast: lots of global warming with a chance of snow
Hoping things will change but I doubt they ever will
Mother nature dying while we yelling drill, baby drill
So in turn the world's heating up, climate change creeping up
Hell, at least those folks at Exxon made a decent buck
Carbon footprints on the world that'll never wash away
While the ones in charge of it ignoring what we got to say
Still we gotta try, all we got is you and I
Put your mother fucking fists in the sky, come and

[Hook]
Stand up, stand up, if you gonna fight for what you believe
Stand up, stand up, if you ain't falling for what they teaching
Stand up, stand up, if any time your back's up against the wall
Stand up, stand up, take away my freedom, you'll give me the reason to stand up!

[Verse 2]
I don't dabble much in things that are political
But it ain't hard to see
That half these politicians running shit are criminal
They way we written history is strictly fictitiously
Still they try tricking me, telling me that I'm living free
Now keeping quiet while they take away our freedoms
(Hell, they're just the constitutional laws, who fuckin' needs em?)
And the mainstream media decides what you'll be seeing
So I'm sceptical of everything, don't know what to believe in
Cause they lying to us right under our noses
And we know it but there's nothing we can do to control it
And it's got me losing sleep
Cause I'm seeing shit different than when I was younger
Watching world hunger while the economy's going under
Too caught up in reality shows and cell phones
Eatin' food full of GMO's to say
Yo! I've had enough of all these lies, all we got is you and I
Put your fucking fists up in the sky, come and

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See now we've got these countries beefin' with us
Like some World War III shit
Things about to change, you'd be blind not to see this
Civil unrest, the greatest country in the west
Bout' to crumble like the Roman Empire, nonetheless
Our oceans full of plastic, and the air is full of chemicals
Well, we let it happen like it's consensual
But fuck that
Educate yourselves and don't fall for what they been tellin'
Just tell them to throw there fist in the sky and start a rebellion!



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Some of these people think I'm famous, well shit I guess I am
It's like every time I go out in CT I see a fan
They're like "Webby your the man", and I'm like god damn
This shit is gettin' crazy even though it's been the plan
Since I sat in 6th grade writin' lyrics on my hand
Dreamin' of the fame and fortune every second that I can
Or I could half the time now I'm finally achievin' it
So if you really got yourself a dream and you believe in it
Then follow it and if they hate don't worry bout the beef and shit
Keep it moving everyday and not for any reason quit
Your friends will say your changin', a lot will turn their backs
Even though its just a job nobody looks at it like that
This my way of makin' money, my fuckin' career choice
And they mad I get a paycheck strictly off my voice
But the bad comes with the good when you chillin' in the game
Because now these chicks are DTF from the moment they hear my name
Like
It's Chris Webby by the way

[Hook]
Oh, oh, starry eyed

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
This game is fuckin' crazy it'll turn homies to enemies
But you gotta rise above it I don't let it get to me
The past is the past though you got some good memories
People turn they back and all you gotta do is let it be
I tried to help a dude once
Help him get a little shine did a track, smoked some blunts
Even kicked it with him as a friend, blazed and spit flows
Got drunk, talked shit, even brought him to my shows
And he was still young so I showed him the ropes
Brought him to some college parties and introduced him to hoes
Then he turned around and dissed me, no doubt I got played
But while he's sittin' up in Brooklyn I be up on stage
Karma is a bitch and I'm makin' it clear
If you want me to get back first get a career
I'll be livin' Hip-Hop 'till the day that I die
And with all this buzz I'm gettin' everybody's starry eyed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
So you wanna be a rap superstar and live large?
You gotta work for it everyday, grind hard
Takin' days off isn't in my repertoire
I got a mean work ethic and endless amounts of bars
They try to say I'm fake, it didn't work for the spot
That's why I've got every east side burb on lock
And it doesn't stop there I get bumped on the block
They all spinnin' "La La La" when they be twistin' up pot
And now they recognize me and haters always try me
Its like because I'm finally successful they despise me
Why can't you all be happy I'm a kid like you
Who's just tryin' to make me some money off these shows I do
If you could do it wouldn't you?
That's what every kid is dreamin' of
Who couldn't shoot hoops or excel in academia
This is for the kids with A.D.D
Who were told they won't amount to nothin', baby just look at me

[Hook]



Ea, it's Chris Webby. Yup, CT where you at?
Check, y'all mother fuckers can hate all the fuck you want
You can't stop me from shinin'. Ha. Yea

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You can't stop my shinin', drop fly rhymin'
And all day for love of Hip-Hop, I'm grindin'
Grindin' grindin', make sparks and blind em
Now throw that beat in like it was said so by Simon
I'm in, tougher than a double black diamond
Hofstra's Mufasa, watch out for the lion
I'm just a dog like Bryan, Griffin
Try and, listen I am, Christian
Graduated out of a prepped out academy
Leapt out, instead of a step out done gradually
That'll be the day I always used to think
Back havin' braces and only juice to drink
My mom's a math teacher my dad plays guitar
My dog's a Bichon, so I can't act hard
Only child in the bunch, I been told I'll go mad far
Fifth grade I said, "Mom I wanna be a rap star! "
And the whole family was taken aback
Embracing rap? Is he seriously takin' the path
After a few years of practice I just played em a track
And now their all dead convinced I'll be famous in fact
Cause

[Hook x2: Samantha Davies]
Cause you could try to stop me shinin'
Or try to hold me down
But I'm a have to keep on grindin'

[Verse 2: Chrs Webby]
Every single day I shine bitch, rhyme sick
I spit, till I can't breathe, some one give me the Heimlich
My waves are seismic, got fly chicks on my dick
As time ticks, I spit it so hot, I change climates
Cause I'm just a crazy white boy with mad talent
A Libra believe dog I'm a stay balanced
With a gallon of liquor within my bladder
Get higher than six ladders, and rock shows like Mick Jagger
Badder than anybody that you've ever seen
Rollin' up that ever green, since way before seventeen
Got a clever scheme, and I hit em with track power
Writin' lyrics stayin' up all night like Jack Bauer
I act louder, and way more belligerent
Got that keg on tap till I'm killin' it
Layin' down the rules like a syllabus
Speakin' in gibberish, tearin' shit down more than a little bit
Cause I, have the flow and have the rhythm
That's why shit is comin' together like magnetism
This cat is spittin', separatin' fact from fiction
Murderin' the crowd with every single rap I've written
I'm Nice !

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I ain't a thug from the hood, but can't stop my shinin'
So shoot me nine times gettin' rich, I'll die tryin'
And then I'll know that you hearin' it
Cause I won't stop till I'm on top like dessert in the food pyramid
Period, I'm clever with wit
Cause if Winnie's the Pooh, bitch Webby's the shit
White boy murders tracks, leave em restin' in peace
So I'm a let Sam kill it for the rest of the beat
Peace, I'm out



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm a Super Villain, where the fucks Kick ass?
One kick to the chest will give em' whiplash
Crack a 6-pack, light a bogie up
Twist a Bamboo, cause bein' sober sucks
I'm the dopest young buck with this rap shit
Crazy mothafucker in need of a strait jacket
Rap it, grab the track and face bash it
Every instrument and the beat will lay in the casket
Ha, cause you know I leave em' hurt son
On the Grassy Knoll, sniper rifle Nerf Gun
You ain't ready for the crazy shit that Chris'll pull
Fuckin' despicable, leavin' every hater miserable
Kick facts, so come with a diss track
I'll hit em' so hard they can't help but sit back
I spit raps amazin'
And flip the fuck out like Liam Neeson
When his daughter was kidnapped and Taken

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I'm mentally insane, on more cocaine than Rick James
Chuggin' Dubra while I be drivin' and switch lanes
This kid's brains suffers psychosis
Runnin' into on comin' traffic with a helmet and a roach clip
The dope shit, that roll and smoke shit
Hotter than bein' on the equator with a coat zipped
Get your boat flipped, I'll leave em' capsized
They smell the chronic in the air when I pass by
I give em' bad vibes, but you know I flow butter
Gave Steve Austin the stone cold stunner
Took a shovel out and I buried The Undertaker
Drop the scissors and attacked rock with paper
Lord Vader mixed with a little Darth Maul
Pedal to the medal til the fuckin' car stalls
Adderall, Ritalin, LSD
I'm meet you up in Webby's world, yo follow me!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I always got one eye open like a coked up Cyclops
No time for sleep, not a day that the grind stops
Kill a beat when I grab the mic, watch
Connect more dots than a bag of dice got
The raps I drop get flipped like I-HOP
Throw more kicks than Noob Saibot cause I rock
Make time stop like the Prince of Persia
Wanted in 47 states, lyrical murder
So believe the shit, I plead the fifth
After I force feed a bulimic chick Swedish fish
I'm an evil prick, with some diesel piff
Slaughter any competition that I'm beefin' with
Beatin' Chris? nah, not likely
I'll whoop my own ass with a tire iron, now come fight me
Till God strikes me down, I'll keep goin'
Givin' Satan himself this free promotion
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



[Chris Webby Verse 1]
Uh, I'm rollin' up, steady blazin' good
With more bars than an Irish neighborhood
You wanna step, I wouldn't say you should
So homie, step aside, I got 'em petrified
I run circles around rappers for exercise
I got the best supplies, puff puff passin' it
Rappin' it immaculate, on point, accurate
Passionate, every last technique I mastered it
So I'm ready for war, Montagues and Capulets
But this ain't Shakespeare, I've been rappin' for more than eight years
Eleven in fact, homie so stay clear
These new rappers think they can see me with a sentence
So I call 'em out, like a teacher doin' attendance
I'm nobody's apprentice, I learned it all from practice
I knew in sixth grade that I be following this rap shit
And back then Webby killed it with rhyme
Givin' listeners goosebumps like I'm R. L. Stein
Grind!

[Hook x2:]
So strong on the mic
Armed for a fight
Never seen somebody go this fuckin' hard in ya life

[Verse 2 - Chris Webby:]
You see I used to bag O's (Or Hoes) like General Mills
Now I'm on a paper chase for those federal bills
Cop kush in large quantity, never seen me buy a gram
Hard body like Downey Jr. in Iron Man
I'mma war machine, smoother than Aquaphor
Killin' 'em like Ares, I'm the god of war
Got some Gabogool Macaroni meatball
Italiano's on the mic until the beat stalls
I make 'em freefall, don't need a parachute
I'm goin' in with a suit of armour and a pair of boots
I'm no Bear Jew but Webby will scare you
Every ligament I'm gonna tear you, there you
Go, tryna outdo me, how dare yo
I blow 'em out like a Jersey Shore hairdo
I spit it dope of course, let me hold the torch
Enough power inside me to battle Voldemort

[Hook x2:]
So strong on the mic
Armed for a fight
Never seen somebody go this fuckin' hard in ya life

[Verse 3 - D. Lector:]
I'm high up in the clouds and I'm hidin' in the NASA spacecraft
With a pint of gin, product of my environment
Writin' with the eye of the tiger and I've been rhyming since
Well, before my first Flinstone vitamin
Leave you lying in a bloody mess like Tiny Tim
Legs dangling like snapped strings on a violin
Tatted like Iverson, Klonopin's collidin' in
My stomach full of JD, Vicodin and Heineken
King of pop, I call this rifle MJ, it's frightening
So beat it, or get jacked son, don't make me bring Michael in
Fucked up, I might have been, shut up, you're lighter than a lighter
I sound like a muscle car idling
Fucking nasty, raspy as Ras Kass combined with Canabis
Mixed with white trash and hashish
A dog like Lassy, the type to fuck Mary K
Raw in the ass and pass the camera to Ashley

[Hook x3:]
So strong on the mic
Armed for a fight
Never seen somebody go this fuckin' hard in ya life



[Hook]
Are you really here or am I dreamin'
I can't tell dreams from truth
For it's been so long since I have seen you
I can hardly remember your face anymore

Yeah, is that really you success?
I know you're close...
But I haven't seen you in so fuckin' long man, you know
I'm a find you though, I'm gonna find you

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah, success, is that you around the corner?
I've been on your trail, now they say it warmer, warmer
It's been a long time since I seen you too
Probably since my last wrestlin' match in high-school
And after that you left me
Packed up and bounced with lady luck, then shit got messy
Grades started slippin' and the drugs kicked in
E pills, Coke, Percs, Klonopins
Either high or in a bad mood
Pissed off teenager, covered in tattoos
Grade A fuck-up, simple as that
I'm surprised my two parents didn't turn their back
But they never gave up on me, I love 'em for that
And I promise I'm a pay it all back with these raps
I know my bail was high but mom and dad I'm a pay back
Every penny or I'll try, let it ride

[Hook]
Are you really here or am I dreamin'
I can't tell dreams from truth
For it's been so long since I have seen you
I can hardly remember your face anymore

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Yeah, success, is that you?
People tell me that you're nearby and I'm hopin' that it's true
Cause lately you haven't made an appearance in my life
Just a spot at the bottom and a lot of long nights
Court fees, shitty jobs, bad luck, drug problems
Or have a non-religious kid looking to God
Swear to God I been through a lot of shit on this path
I'm not here to brag about it but no one can change the past
I put together raps, tryna make myself a stag with it
I've put my heart, soul, everything I had in this
Slice my wrists and I bleed for this rappin' shit
How could you mothafuckers say I'm not passionate?
This is all I've ever loved, do it till the death of me
Proven that I'm worthy, I don't care what they expect from me
And I'll do it till there's not a breath left in me
Tryna make it in this crazy world successfully
Ah, tryna make it in this crazy world successfully
Tryna make it in this crazy world successfully
Tryna make it in this crazy world successfully
Yeah

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
So many people told me success was up for the takin'
But I can't tell if it's real or all my imagination
Spit it so sick, that I need a vaccination
But I'm still underrated as fuck, any occasion
That I had to rise to, I did
But they still consider me a gimmick strictly just because of where I live
Dope when I rap I flow, it's my path to blow
This ain't the mothafuckin' white rapper show
Sharpin' skills like katanas in the arms of a ninja
Pure bred with the heart of a winner
Put my all in this shit, if I fall or I trip
I'm just gettin' back up, never callin' it quits
So hard when I spit, you need armor for this
Dusk till dawn till I'm gone, I'm a spit
Do it till I got nothin' left
Word to my very last breath I'm a find my success
Yeah

[Hook]
Are you really here or am I dreaming
I can't tell dreams from truth
For it's been so long since I have seen you
I can hardly remember your face anymore



In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You see I roll it up and light it when my Zippo gets ignited
It's an addiction at this point so what's the point in tryna fight it
Pass a bong with Miley Cyrus, and Michael Phelps in a cypher
Even Schwarzenegger hit it, when I passed homie the lighter
Puffin that pharmaceutical so Cali's where I'm movin' to
Blazin' on a sunny afternoon this shit it beautiful
The sun is in the sky, but you still can see the moon
While I'm (blazin' on a sunny afternoon)
Cause I'm feelin' spectacular, puff puff passenger
On a NASA spacecraft up above passin' ya
Abra-cadabra, I'll make the weed vanish bitch
Brain damage, tree bandit, rollin' up the cannabis
Kickin' back baby and I'm lovin' it
While I be puffin' on dozens of my herbal supplements
That's just how I does it, so somebody grab a dub of piff
And I'll go grab a dutch to split, and we'll be gettin' dumb as shit

[Hook]
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well give me two good reasons why I oughta stay
Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury, blazin' on a sunny afternoon

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Uh, yeah, and you know I'm not the sober type
So fuckin' high that I can barely even hold the mic
Always smokin', but yea I got probation
But fuck, rules are made to be broken right?
I'm a crazy dude, burnin' watchin' paper-view
Munchin' on some Asian food, roll a J, of haze or two
Stay higher than Harry Potter flyin' on his broom
While I'm (blazin' on a sunny afternoon)
Chelsea have you seen me lately?, I think I'm goin' crazy
Tokin' on a vaporizer till my brain is broken baby
Rarely sober, I can't help it I'm a stoner
Always got that fresh out the baggy weed aroma
When some say it's a bad habit, I just fuckin' laugh at it
Grab the bong and pack it and hit it until I'm asthmatic
Brain always movin' slow like it's some bad traffic
You can't OD on pot? Shit, I'll take a stab at it

[Hook]
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well give me to good reasons why I oughta stay
Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I'm always twistin' up the ganja
Since 8th grade graduated with high honors
No one's gettin' higher when I roll the EZ-wider
I'll be chillin' with Harold and Kumar munchin' on some sliders
Where's my fuckin lighter, yo somebody grab the Illadelph
I'll step my game up from water bottle bongs I built myself
Gettin' super silly, smoke fills up the room
While I'm (blazin' on a sunny afternoon)
When it comes to marijuana, I'm a heavy user
Even puffin in my dreams, pass a J with Freddy Kruger
It's like my medication at this point in life
I start itchin' when I'm stuck without a joint to light
Cotton mouth like I've been chewin' on my t-shirt
Girls are third, money second, but I need my weed first
So you wanna burn? hope you got an ounce to bring
Shit I gotta go, yo I'm late for drug counseling

[Hook]
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well give me to good reasons why I oughta stay
Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime



[Intro: Chris Webby]
I always wanted to be a superhero man
Have my own super power and shit
Well now I do

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I grew up an only child, young Webby in the playpen
Just me and my giant imagination
Playing with my ninja turtles and my spacemen
And reading books instead of going out to make friends
Other kids liked girls and they played sports
I was in my own world on a strange course
Everywhere, I had a pen in my hand
It's like being a rapper was already the plan
But nahh, I was writing short stories and drawing pictures
My creative energy was off the Richter
Looking up to superheroes in my comics
The love and respect that they got's what I wanted
But how could I do it, my skills seem useless
Up until I got introduced to rap music
I fell in love that day, and I knew
That just maybe I could have a super power too

[Hook: Chris Webby]
I'm going crazy, that's what they said but I kept it moving
Cause this dream's all I got even if they all said I could never do it
But I never slowed down
I just kept my head straight 'til I made a movement
And now... I'm feeling super human

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Years went by and I kept on practicing
Even when it seemed the shit was never happening
Freestyle cyphers on a blunt ride after them
High school parties, writing songs, rap battling
Had me thinking that my super powers were building
Starting feeling I could really change the world with what I'd written
Still continued to write, made a conscious decision
To keep it real on the mic and give em my life
Through the good bad and ugly, my fans still rock with me
Fuck a gimmick, my gimmick is brutal honesty
And they respect that, so I show respect back
Since that first time at school that I took off my pen cap
Wrote my first bars, scribbled lyrics at my desk
In a five subject notebook and I filled every section
Page after page as my skills kept channeling
Young Anakin, now the force can't handle him

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
My super powers have evolved better look out
Shit I'm Gambit with a full house
Magneto in a metal room
Imhotep when he left the tomb
Superman in the air now
I'm Scott Summers in a stare down
No one's stepping to the shit I'm doing
I'm here and I'm super human

[Scratched]
"I-I-I got an S on my chest"



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I’m a walking bad habit, E tabs up in the cabinet
Savage rap status: vocabulary extravagant
A rock star poppin’ rotches in bars
Used to flip bud now just rappin’ cop me a car
No tellin’, Connecticut felon, I GPS ‘em
And find my mark like Magellan with more lines than Corey Feldman
I never cease to impress ‘em
I cardiac arrest ‘em
With every studio session I'm killin' ‘em, no question
Webb’s back, better hold your breath when I’m rhyming homes
I murder beats, I’m Jonah Hex on the microphone
Fiends saying I’m the dopest yet
And haters? I shrug ‘em off until my fucking shoulders sweat
I’m breaking bones, a modern version of Casey Jones
Sword in hand, I’m the winner playing the Game of Thrones
Fuck beef, my rapping style’s filet mignon
Gettin’ drunk, fuck yo’ driver, somebody take me home

[Hook: (Some Girl) & Slaine]
(Take me home)
Take me home now bitch
(Take me home)
Watch for the cops, hit the blinker when you switch
(Take me home)
Lanes ‘cause you know that I’m famous and I’m rich
(Take me home)
Eyes on the road, take me home now bitch
(Take me home)
Take me home now bitch
(Take me home)
Watch for the cops, hit the blinker when you switch
(Take me home)
Lanes ‘cause you know that I’m famous and I’m rich
(Take me home)
Eyes on the road, take me home now bitch

[Verse 2: Slaine]
I know that I should change, but I don’t really think I can
It’s just part of my nature – I never cracked, I never ran
The world was falling on me when my back was in a jam
I always kept on fighting, that’s exactly who I am
And this is who I am, no way that I can change it
I’m buckwild, stupid, and dangerous
My best friends are not strangers
These are the motherfuckers I hang with
We speak the same language
And I ain’t saying French, English, or Spanish, or Spanglish
I mean pain and anguish, this cocaine slangin’ bang-bang shit
MAC-11s that we aim with
In other words, I’m rolling with the same clique I came with
I’m the sameness and fuck being famous
Fame dreams are for groupies
I’m a real-life gangster that you ain’t seen in the movies
What I mean is I’m truly off the hook
Like a phone in a nursing home, homie I’m that Boston crook

[Hook: (Some Girl) & Slaine]
(Take me home)
Take me home now bitch
(Take me home)
Watch for the cops, hit the blinker when you switch
(Take me home)
Lanes ‘cause you know that I’m famous and I’m rich
(Take me home)
Eyes on the road, take me home now bitch
(Take me home)
Take me home now bitch
(Take me home)
Watch for the cops, hit the blinker when you switch
(Take me home)
Lanes ‘cause you know that I’m famous and I’m rich
(Take me home)
Eyes on the road, take me home now bitch

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I damage tracks, so listeners always ran it back
Always with a half-ounce stuffed into a sandwich bag
I kill it quickly and always keeping the realest with me
Stealing all the fucking insulin from Wilford Brimley
“Diabetes,” rappers could never beat us
I been spittin’ shit like this since I was just a fuckin’ fetus
Keep your chick with me as long as she give dome
Rollin’ up the Diesel, I’m burning like Jim Rome
Bitch!

[Verse 4: Slaine]
Yeah, standin’ here’s a man with the past, the inspiration
For the kids on the corner, but still got the laugh of a mental patient
The infiltration of the game
Born from a central hatred of fame
A pencil shaking with pain
An injured stake in the claim from the wrath I became
My paragaphs’ insane: they're futuristic pictures of the past from which I came
And this is Slaine with a shotty in the hooptie son
My whole career’s a robbery that they could never scoop me from

[Hook: (Some Girl) & Slaine]
(Take me home)
Take me home now bitch
(Take me home)
Watch for the cops, hit the blinker when you switch
(Take me home)
Lanes ‘cause you know that I’m famous and I’m rich
(Take me home)
Eyes on the road, take me home now bitch
(Take me home)
Take me home now bitch
(Take me home)
Watch for the cops, hit the blinker when you switch
(Take me home)
Lanes ‘cause you know that I’m famous and I’m rich
(Take me home)
Eyes on the road, take me home now bitch



[Intro]
We on the track
Webby’s on the track, Jitta’s on the track
Jitta On The Track
And we here

[Verse 1: Jitta On The Track]
Check, alright
I done smoked a big blunt, you just through a bitch fit
I beat your girl box up, that Biz Markie shit
I’m back up in this bitch, it’s that nigga Jit’
All you rappers clitoris, I’m on that New England shit
Lumberjacks and Timberlands, alien intelligence
You be on your high horse? Bitch I’m on my Pegasus
Lumberlife confederate, I be so high talkin’ bills like a pelican
Smoke the whole car out, ridin’ ‘round Connecticut
Bitch I’m off the hook like a motherfuckin’ home phone
Dial tone, no really, dial Tone
‘Cause that’s my fuckin’ weed man, and plus he got the fire ho
Burn so much tree it looks like I beef with a firehose
I been fresh since the womb, bruh
Kicks so white they scream, "Fuck yeah dude bruh"
I like my money green and my weed purple, son
Drink so dark it looks like Bobby Shmurda’s gums
Follow it, hit the club, fuck the fuzz, fuck with us
Your girlfriend givin’ us drunken love, no Beyoncé
They ask where I'm at, said, "It's beyond me"
Got in the bag like Frito Lay
‘Bout to hit a lick like a Cheeto stain
Every day is Carleto’s way, nigga drop
Man I’ve been a bitch, nigga flex on me
Better bet he next, oh yeah, oh yeah
That Homegrown smoke in the fuckin' air
Gotta use Visine, just to make it fuckin’ clear

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Blue skies, sunshine, the world’s mine
We takin’ over the world
We takin’ over, takin’ over
We takin’ over the world
Long time, you know why, the world’s mine
We takin’ over the world
We takin’ over, takin’ over
Takin’ over the world

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
We takin’ over like Somali pirates, where the fuck is Captain Phillips?
Rap the illest shit you’ve ever heard in less than half a minute
Tryin’ to stack until I’m losin’ track while addin’ digits
Chill out for a second, smoke a joint, and then it’s back to business
Chuggin’ bottles, spittin’ flows, and then I’m smashin’ bitches
Now my number’s in your girl’s phone like her apps and widgets
I see the finish line, just got another lap to finish
Rattle off these rap and Snapple facts and blow a sack of spinach
You haven’t heard of me? Then I don’t give a fuck already
Y’all must be livin’ under a rock like SpongeBob’s bestie
Eatin’ beats, always got a little duck sauce ready
So haters suck a dick, get the fuck off Webby
Stay with a bogey like I’m Lauren Bacall
And get it crackin’ like I dropped a fuckin’ porcelain doll
“Dude that’s my mom’s"
Now let me spin the wheel of fortune for y’all
Enjoy the fruits of my labor like apple orchards in fall
Homegrown in the building, me and Jitta be the botanists
Plantin’ seeds so deep they root systems are where the fossils sit
We on that full time grind, y’all just some hobbyists
Run circles ‘round these rappers and I’m barely even joggin’, bitch
Punches make your body flip, Webby on that Rocky shit
Yo Adrian, shake that ass and get to droppin’ trick
Suck it then you swallow it, then take another molly
Licks of Henny from my goblet, and hit it till the condom rips

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Blue skies, sunshine, the world’s mine
We takin’ over the world
We takin’ over, takin’ over
We takin’ over the world
Long time, you know why, the world’s mine
We takin’ over the world
We takin’ over, takin’ over
Takin’ over the world



[Intro]
You motherfuckers, I hate you
I hate all you fucking assholes
So fucking pissed off right now
Yeah yeah temper, temper, calm down Webby...

[Verse 1]
Some of these websites won't post me cause I rep for the burbs
Without even spinnin' my record or inspectin' my words
But while these bloggers underestimate my level of skill
I’ma shove this shit in their faces when I settle a deal
No fuck that, I'll shove it in their faces now
Cause I’m unsigned makin' a couple thou for rappin' in front of crowds
But because of where I'm from these dudes don't take me serious
And make assessments in seconds before they here me spit
Can you tell I'm pissed? well spectacular
Webby's a cold blooded prick, a young Dracula
To shatter your clavicle bone, tie you up and drag ya
From the back of an Acura then set you up in the passenger seat
Belt buckle you in and then poor gas
All over your squirmin' body, drop a Zippo on your lap
Cock my head back laughin' maniacally,  take that bitch
Throw a match in the gas tank, blow you to fragments
Come back with a dust pan and sweep up all your ashes
And sprinkle em' on the toilet paper I'll wipe my ass with
I got the craziest rap tactics
Smokin' crack till I black out and wreak havoc
On women and children, I like elderly too
Anybody who's not a subscriber to my YouTube
Gon' get it, so if you don’t like what I do
Suck my motherfuckin' dick until your face turns blue

[Hook]
They like temper, temper calm down Webby
Take it down a notch, the world’s not ready
Let em talk shit they ain’t steppin to you
They just mad of what you’re destined to do
They like temper, temper calm down Webby
Take a chill pill man, the world’s not ready
They mad at you for doin' everything that you do
So piss me off and I will hate to be you

[Verse 2]
I know my attitude can get pissy every so often
But there’s so many dudes in this world that's pissin' me off and
I should shut my mouth, just smile back and keep on walkin'
But I’ve kept my temper cool to the point it's causin' exhaustion
My dude Apathy told me to relax and just spit these
Bars, and ignore all these fuckin' faggots who diss me
Who use my name in the hopes that I lose my cool and diss back
And they'll get buzz by me puttin' the name in the track
So I zip it and continue on my promisin' path, makin' cash
So while they're runnin' their mouth, I just gotta laugh
Sit back, cop some dope from a groupie and just relax
Even though deep in my soul I wanna go get me an axe
Run up on their doorstep lookin' like a lumberjack
Swing and slash till you couldn't I.D. the dude I attacked
But shit I've been to jail once and I’m not tryin' to go back
So I let it simmer in my brain until my skull cracks
Say to myself, temper temper Webby, turn it down a notch
Then the devil on my shoulder says to go walk down the block
Find a shit talker, drag him to the highest mountain top
Give him a parachute with a hole in it throw him down and watch
Him hit the ground, splatter all over the fuckin' pavement
Stand over what’s left of him yellin' out "now say shit"
I know I’m a deranged headcase
But it’s my temper, I need anger management to help contain me
Like

[Hook]

[Outro]
You mother fuckers
I'll fuckin, I'll kick you in the god damn shins and make you run a lap
Fuckin' scrape your taste buds out and feed you the best meal you ever had
You won't be even able to taste it
I'll uh, scrape your eyes out and put on the Shawshank Redemption
It's a great movie and you're gonna miss it cause you're blind
Assholes



[Intro]
See life’s a crazy thing man
Sometimes you’re up, sometimes you’re down
At least we alive

[Verse 1]
They tellin’ me, tellin’ me, tellin’ me, "Life is amazin’ "
Then why am I runnin’ from all of my problems in bottles of Jameson?
I’m stuck in this cycle of self-medication
Not only me, it’s probably you
We all got our vices, gettin us through
For all the shit life will leave at our shoes
On the door step like the daily news
But what can we do? Just buckle the fuck up, and get to enjoyin’ the ride
At least we alive, even when everything seems like it sucks, just keep that in mind
I know, know, know, that ain’t no one keepin’ me down
Just tryin’ to stay with them positive vibes until I’m six feet in the ground
I don’t even need me a casket, just take all my cremated ashes
Throw ‘em up high, and let the wind take ‘em wherever it pleases whenever it passes
But until that day I’ma keep my head high, live life my way
Through all the frustration, all of the pain, all that you really could say is, “That’s life”

[Verse 2]
They tellin’ me, tellin’ me, tellin’ me, "Look on the bright side"
But that silver linin’ ain’t easy to see when I’m sittin’ and watchin’ the time fly
So if you feelin’ likewise, just follow me, follow me, follow me down
Shit I don’t know where the fuck that I’m goin’ but nobody’s stoppin’ me now
Whether or not I’m the popular sound
The radio station on public opinions
Nothin’ to me, I’m not stuck in my feelings
Fuck how they feelin’, I grinded for years and got peanuts compared to these others with millions
But uh, I’m not complainin’ man
The thing about problems, dude, we get caught up in
Forget that everyone else has got ‘em too
These dark circles, sittin’ under my eyes
I spark purple, ‘cause I’m stuck in this bind
I’m star searchin’, but there’s nothin’ to find
So when they ask me if it’s worth it, I just tell ‘em, “That’s life”

[Outro]
That’s life man
Fuck it, at least we livin’, right?



[Intro]
You were knocking it out today bro, turn that beat up though
Okay (ya ya)

[Verse 1]
Coming straight up out the cave of wonders
I played the game like I'm at Dave & Buster's
So if you want a shot at me you better take a number
'Cause see, I'm 'bout to fuck the world until I break the rubber
Rape and plunder, you better stay and cover
I'm coming for the iron throne
Got white walker in my chromosomes
From a place beyond the wall you shouldn't go alone
Icy flesh up on my frozen bones
Eyes the color of the meth that Walter cooked up in his mobile home
I go to war and bring that wild aggression
Like Khaleesi's dragons, every time I rhyme in a session
I'm not wishing on a star for no divine intervention
I'm just killing everybody that's in the line of succession
Leaving impression just check my analytics
Or you can read my origin story up in the hieroglyphics
And your knocky genetics mix with the scientific experimental test that took my mind to a higher limit
Higher learning way before I was a rap vet
Introduce you dummies to my crash test
Still Connecticut up on my driver's license address
The type of breed we never had yet

[Chorus]
I'm the one they talk about under they breath
Never say it out loud or I come for they neck
And I'm a double your bet
Take shots, nothing but net
Stacking green like the fucking Connect (yeah)
Yeah, I'm the one they talk about under they breath
Never say it out loud or I come for they neck
And I'm a double your bet
Take shots, nothing but net
Stacking green like the fucking Connect (yeah)

[Verse 2]
You see I never been a fighter, I just kill them with my wits
And I'm smarter than most, so shit's as simple as it gets (true)
Got a little bad thing licking on my dick (ugh)
Again and again like I'm living in a .gif
Or a boomerang, I pack the hookah with a super strain
Rolling with the Koopa gang, right up out the sewer drain
Mutant ninja rapper, baby, I'm a do my thang
While I'm maneuvering, through your ladies NuvaRing, bang
Ain't no way out there to measure me
I tip the scales very heavily as I cleverly prepare the recipe
And cook-up all this fire every Wednesday with nothing but the bare necessities
Webby be a mongrel, I'll do to you
What happened to those people that booked a room in the movie Hostel
I'm hostile, I'll leave you horizontal, way down with the fossils
Christian Webster flipping letters like I'm playing Boggle
Grab a pair of goggles, baby get a scuba mask
'Cause you'll be sleeping where the groupers and the tunas at
Like Luca Brasi can't even find you with google maps
Do the math, yo your dude is back

[Chorus]
I'm the one they talk about under they breath
Never say it out loud or I come for they neck
And I'm a double your bet
Take shots, nothing but net
Stacking green like the fucking Connect (yeah)
Yeah, I'm the one they talk about under they breath
Never say it out loud or I come for they neck
And I'm a double your bet
Take shots, nothing but net
Stacking green like the fucking Connect (yeah)

[Verse 3]
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
They don't ever know what it go down when I get my zone on
You better go long, because my throwing arm is the same one I hold the mic with, it's so strong, Mighty Joe Young
Oh lord, I've been so gone
So fucking high I've been passing right through the Ozone
Webby spit it so cold you gon' need to keep your winter coat on for the whole song

[Chorus]
I'm the one they talk about under they breath
Never say it out loud or I come for they neck
And I'm a double your bet
Take shots, nothing but net
Stacking green like the fucking Connect (yeah)
Yeah, I'm the one they talk about under they breath
Never say it out loud or I come for they neck
And I'm a double your bet
Take shots, nothing but net
Stacking green like the fucking Connect (yeah)

[Outro]



[Intro: Steve Miller]
Some people call me the space cowboy, yeah
Some call me the gangster of love

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You see they label me as poorly influencin' the kids
But that's straight, I'm just tellin' 'em the way that I live
Cause I be rolling up bud until I can barely talk even
Drinking like a younger Kenny Powers durin' off season
I'm the reason your mother won't let your little brother listen to rap
All I talk about is chicks that I've smashed
And every single drug I've done and I'll continue to do
But this is my life, it shouldn't make a difference to you
I'm a beast, popping pills like Bradley Cooper in "Limitless"
Live the life you wish you could live and I'll never get sick of it
I smoke cigarettes, my momma says I should quit
And I probably should but nah, fuck that shit
I be wreckin' with Kinetics you haters better forget it
If they ain't feelin' it they must have injected anesthetics
Live it like I said and every decision's reckless
This is Webb love me or hate me, you best accept it

[Hook: Steve Miller]
Cause' I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
Playin' my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a mid-night toker
I get my loving on the run
Wooo wooooooo woo

[Verse 2: Kinetics]
My brain's busted I don't think that shit is in service
Flippin' the finger and cursin' so I'll get injured on purpose
So when I'm with the surgeon I can be convincin' the nurses
For that prescription to purchase weed for medicinal purposes
You know that you are too damn blunted and need help
When you sittin' on the couch and you reach for a seat belt
Me and Webby just a bunch of motherfuckers who pop uppers
And get so fucked up that we start headbuttin' each other
No disrespect to the Thriller I'm a killer when I flow for y'all
Cause every night I murder the mic, Propofol
So any rapper that's bad enough to be battlin'
I'm stabbin' him and jabbin' a javelin in his abdomen
Cause I'm a joker and usually never sober
But I'm infinite, like the number 8 was tipped over
From New York to Connecticut, Kinectics has connected it
Timmy Talent sampled it and then Webby perfected it

[Hook: Steve Miller]
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
Playin' my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a mid-night toker
I get my loving on the run
Wooo wooooooo woo

[Interlude: Steve Miller (Chris Webby)]
Some people call me the space cowboy yeah
(Yeah I'm feeling real good right now you know)
Some call me the gangster of love
(This is me and uh... I'm not changing for nobody)
Some people call me Maurice
(You know you don't like it then uh...)
Cause I speak of the pompatus of love
(You can go fuck yourself buddy. Bring that hook back, yeah.)

[Hook: Steve Miller]
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
Playin' my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a mid-night toker
I get my loving on the run
Wooo wooooooo woo
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
Playin' my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a mid-night toker
I get my loving on the run



[Hook (2x):]
We've been in the rain*
We've been on the mountains
We've been round the fire
And fancy hotels
Drank water from the well

[Verse 1 :Chris Webby]
Uh I'm stepping in this game and paying dues
Building a reputation now we making major moves
And now it's moving, how it's moving anyway I choose
And I've been working way to hard to just not make it through
You talk about me, prepare for what I say to you
Cause I'm a man and I will stand by what I say and do
There's a lot of ups and downs within this game of life
For every hater there's a girl that wants to stay the night
And now I got myself a taste of the fame
I'm addicted I've got nothing else to chase
I kill it on the stage but still I miss the days
Of chilling in the crowd like a normal kid my age
But still I got this paper and still I got my pencil
And the craziest part is I haven't hit my full potential
The life I live is stressful, everyday suspenseful
Grinding every minute of my life to be successful

[Hook:]
We've been in the rain
We've been on the mountains
We've been round the fire
And fancy hotels
Drank water from the well

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Uh I'm trying to make it with my sanity
Moving from the underground roots up to the canopy
Do it how I do it I just hope they understanding me
Trying to make it right with every member of my family
I know I was the mess up but now Chris stepped up
And took hold of what I always wanted from the setup
Now when people mention me they saying I'm the next up
It's been a long time since that A.D.D. checkup
The underclassman's graduated, top of the class
Now when I walk around town people nod when they pass
I'm just a kid who messed his life up and put it back together
A kid who hit the bottom and came back stronger than ever
I've been jerked around, stolen from, told I would fail
But now the numbers going up on every check in the mail
And if they not feeling it, ill spit it in brail
Hating on me gets you know where keep on chasing your tail

[Hook (2x):]
We've been in the rain
We've been on the mountains
We've been round the fire
And fancy hotels
Drank water from the well

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
You think the life I live is wonderful
Let me give you the flipside
Try to go with the flow and get caught up in the riptide
Everyday it's studio or driving to a show
And no I'm not complaining I'm just letting people know
There's a lot of hard work that goes right into the grind
Especially without being signed and working overtime
Now every time I meet a girl there is a difference
Cause all they want is Webby without even meeting Christian
They just want to fuck, maybe roll an l
And go back in the morning with a story to tell
And though it sounds great, the side of it you don't see
Is that the end of the day you're still lonely
The fans show me love and I love my ninjas back
They hold me down and I'm forever thankful of that
And I won't let you down you have my word on that
Cause I'm here for good the best of the burbs is back

[Hook (2x):]
We've been in the rain
We've been on the mountains
We've been round the fire
And fancy hotels
Drank water from the well



[Chorus: Skrizzly Adams]
See, time goes by, but I swear that it's stalling
I've had it all, but it all just feels the same
No lie, I've been praying for the calling
Chips all in
Steal the game
Steal the game

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Na-na-nah hold the phone
All those years I rode alone
Weight of the world on my shoulder bones
(knock-knock-knock-knock-knock)
But it feels like no one's home
I been on the same shit (on the same shit)
Going through these changes (through these changes)
But I haven't seen a change-up on my credit statements
Everyone walked all over me (all over me)
And I let 'em
Let the wrong people get close to me (get close to me)
But I learned my lesson
And they left me here with these broken dreams (with these broken dreams)
So I swept 'em
And this dustpan in my one hand
While the other one's grippin' a weapon
Through the depression, self-reflection
Poor training, and misdirection
From coaches I put my trust in
But fuck 'em I'll never sweat 'em
I promise I'll never let you
Pass the position I currently live in
I'm lapping you in my sweatsuit
Hand the baton right over the line
I'm leaving this bitch with a medal (with a medal)
I want gold, silver, yeah all of that
In that back room with that black mask
I'll take that
Yeah, ASAP
Don't make a move, don't say shit
Just lay flat, cooperate and this'll only take a minute (only take a minute)
That's just the cost of winning (ha-ha)

[Chorus: Skrizzly Adams]
See, time goes by, but I swear that it's stalling
I've had it all, but it all just feels the same
No lie, I've been praying for the calling
Chips all in
Steal the game
Steal the game

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I-I-I-I been feeling stalled out
Hit home runs and I fouled out
Been broke as hell and I balled out (true)
Conditioned to run that long route
Got the stamina and endurance (yeah)
To handle any occurrence
From the showtimes to the low times
My skill set's my insurance (oooh)
I won't back down and I won't run (nah)
Unless we talkin' bout the track
Even Yoda said I'm that Rogue One
When The Empire Strikes Back
I'ma just snap (I'ma just snap)
This is the warm-up (this is the warm-up)
Put the team on my back (on my back)
Technique and my form up
Believe when I warn ya
Fillin' up my bag, I
Came to empty your stash spot
Put the key in that padlock
You got five minutes and that clock's tickin'
Don't be a hero, don't fidget or move
I'm not really in the mood
'Cause I came here to take everything and that's exactly what I'm gon' do
No fucks given, no competition, nah
No I won't lose
Can't fuck with him, my intuition is
From a third-eye view (ye-yeah)
Don't feel the same, my feelings changed
My adversaries gon' feel the pain
When they tune in and they hear my name
On that broadcast when I steal the game (bang)

[Chorus: Skrizzly Adams]
See, time goes by, but I swear that it's stalling
I've had it all, but it all just feels the same
No lie, I've been praying for the calling
Chips all in
Steal the game
Steal the game



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Got the sun in the sky, roll my windows down
Bass turned up, that shit surround sound
I'm a dog, rollin' with a fox-like hound
And another blunt wrap, wheels spinnin' on the ground
Cruisin', I don't give a fuck where I'm headed
Gas tank full to the brim, unleaded
Fast lane flow so these cops can't catch it
Was that my exit? Nah, fuck it, forget it
I-95, no traffic dude
With my pedal to the floor, too fast for you
Break down lane, straight passin' you
I got a need for speed, it's what I have to do
Every street ahead of me is paved in gold
EZ pass and I'm out, never paid a toll
Sun roof down with an eighth to blow
Not givin' one fuck which way I go

[Hook]
Anyone could see the road that they walked on
Is paved in gold
And it's always summer
They'll never get cold
They'll never get hungry
They'll never get old and gray
You can see their shadows
Wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home
But they really don't care
They wanted the highway
They're happier there today
Today

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
On a road, this is how I live my life
No turn signal, swerve to the right
Where I'm headed, never gotta windshield wipe
Not a cloud in the sky cause the weather's too nice
The sun does nothin' but shine
Ain't nobody got a watch, no need for time
I got my seat reclined, and I never see a reason why
You go back to anything you leave behind
Lightin' up a cigarette, ash out the window
Shades on my face with my fitted hat, brim low
On my way to a place I've never been, yo
Stompin' on the pedal with my size 10 Timbos
Speed hittin' over a buck
No flashin' lights I just can't be touched
Trust, I'mma be livin' it up
Destination unknown not givin' a fuck

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I know, I know
I'mma be travelin' straight on this road of gold
Never knowin' where the fuck I'm gonna go, but yo
I know that I'mma find my way

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
No complainin', better stop that bitchin'
Get on the road, and drive and start livin'
Tomorrow ain't promisin', enjoy what you're given
Reach for the stars, enough you can't miss 'em
Follow my lead as I rip those beats
And you'll get where you're goin' when you hit those streets
Livin' life like Gran Turismo 3
I'm just gettin' where I feel I gotta be
Ha !

[Hook]



See I been grindin' for a long time man...
But I'm here now--there goes the neighborhood I guess

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You see I'm here to save the day with this music
Grindin' till the point I think I'm really going to lose it
But I won't lose nothing! They tryna step to me but shit
You think you could do better with it homie, then go and do somethin!
Uh! They tryna tell me I'm crazy, but shit I'm crazy good
Step into your city they saying, "There goes the neighborhood"
For Sale signs go up soon as I show up
They building bomb shelters cause they know I'm gonna blow up
Uh! Bright future they say I'm a ticking time-bomb
Until I'm up on MTV waving, saying, "Hi Mom"
Grab your video cameras and get your Nikons
Making history from the second they flip the lights on
I made it off being business savvy and street smart
Who needs a co-sign? I let them beats talk
I don't need another rapper lendin' help
Tellin' listeners I'm dope as shit, I'll tell'em that myself
I'm just playing what I'm dealt
Shit it's been a long road but I got alot under my belt
And I've felt, at times, it was a lost cause
But I always got back up on my paws dawg
So I know I'm gonna make it in the long haul
Shit, it's now or never homie! I cannot stall
So I'm gonna reach up for the stars and I'll pray for the best
And that's how it's gonna be until the day of my death. Word

[Hook: A. Mitch]
Just play and tune into this music
Have no fear I'll save the day with this music
My city on my back and I'mma take it
Whereever I go, wherever I go (x2)
Say hello to the new guy in town
"There goes the neighborhood" is what they say

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Twelve years in the making, far from immediate
But it's now to sink my teeth in it, I'm on my beastly shit
Cause I'm sick as fuck, you don't believe me bitch?
Then go ahead and spit that semen on a petri dish
You need sterilizer just to give me dap
Unless you want your immune system attacked, real rap
I'm not doing no duggie
These fuckin' idiots should drop the swag and take notes
Cause they could learn something from me
This is all I do man, murder instrumentals
With this fire off the top like Sweet Tooth in Twisted Metal
Spittin rebel with a cause, deadly with the bars
Underdog since day one, wasn't expecting your applause
I respect your damn opinion if you don't like my music
But if you don't repect my hustle, then you ain't paying attention
I pay so many fucken dues my wallets empty
Ain't a person here stoppin' Webby. Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Fucken animal, Webby's the Sarenghetti type
They whippin Lambos but I made it on a peddled bike
Not even Gatorade replenishes electrolytes
I burn growin' up from the fucken second I get the mic
I'm the grittiest, grimiest, and the wittiest
Jack the Ripper to the beats I'm gettin' busy with
And half these rapper idiots aren't even literate
I'm battle tested and ready, Webby a young Odysseus
Fire in my eyes and a hunger for success
I'm huntin' for the title while they huntin' for check
Wondering what's next but I'm going in fist swingin'
Till your ears ringin' they don't expect what this kid's bringin'
So if you didn't notice, so homie just don't provoke it
I got my state on my shoulders till I'm getting scoliosis, never gonna stop
My life's like the script of Verticle Limit motherfucker, I'm getting to the top!

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Still I'm off the chain, Webby need a leash
I'm consistently givin' you shit that's clever and unique
If you don't think that I'm wreckin' every second that you sleep
You basically played yourself like Puff an get him to the Greek
Now when I be spittin' people actually listen
Because Webby be rippin' with grammatical precision
Adverbs and adjectives, kickin' all these damn vowels
Constanents till my enemy sweat, here's a hand towel
ShamWow salesman, beatin' up you bitches
Cookin' up a classic with this heat from out the kitchen
I'm originally genius, brain out of proportion
And got your girls legs spread wider than Air Jordan
I'm ballin', every single syllable I said is clear
Ridin' into Camelot to stick it into Guinevere
King Aurthur flow, on top like the Northern Hemisphere
Murderin' the verse, so I guess that I gotta end it here

[Hook]
Webby's on the flow, fitted hat low, they already know it's about to go down
Bout to go down, bout to go down, bout to go down, down, down, down
And when I get signed on that dotted line
They already know it's about to go down, they already know
They already know, they already know, they already know
They already know, it's about to go down

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Verse two, if your a mic, then I'mma murk you
Any problem I got I grin and bear it and work through
So stop sleepin', I'll give you a later curfew
Your not feelin' it? You must've took a perk dude
Cause I got everybody turnin' up they volume
Cause it's about to go down like a log flume
I live the life now, rappin' is my frickin' job
Roll with more bitches then racin' the Iditarod
Get it? cause girl dogs are called bitches
The Iditarod's a dog race, now keep up with it
If you can't follow my lyrics mothafucker just dance
Cause my lines above your head like a Red Woods branch
Rhymin' with the best, flyer then the rest
Steve Carell in Anchorman, I'll put a trident to your chest
I'm new school in the flesh
And they already know, they already know that Webby's up next

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I'm rollin' with an OZ, pockets always full of green
Logan with his dog tags on, I'm fuckin' Wolverine
Slicin' up my competition with the adamantium
Aimin' for a title that ain't ever had a champion
Stay poppin' Ambien to put me to sleep
Cause with all the Adderall shit, I'll be up for a week
Fuck it I'm done, the hottest dude under the sun
My Ninja's outnumber haters by a hundred to one
Shout to Mac Miller, MGK, Wax and Herbal T
Any white boy who can actually go hard's ok with me
I rep Connecticut exactly where I say I be
And I got Apathy's blessin', so I'mma stay ya see
Keep on hatin' me, you'll see the tables turn
Cause I'mma mothafuckin' animal in layman's terms
I'mma psychopathic off-spring of Satan's sperm
So walk in front of me an we'll see just the way you burn

[Hook]



[Intro]
Yea
We goin’ through the motherfuckin’ roof
You know what I mean?

[Hook]
I’m through the roof
I’m through the roof
So through the roof that I can’t get no higher than I am (x4)

[Verse 1]
I’m through the roof like St. Nicholas
But I don’t got no Christmas gifts I’m only here to spit this shit
Beam me up Scotty, My feet are liftin’ quick
Speed over infinite, leavin’ the solar system bitch
I’m out in the mysterious beyond
With a fat booty blonde and a jar of marijuana
Sauna, flow so hot, so hot my whole life is like a slow-mo shot
Passin’ mars craters, and waivin’ at Darth Vader
The sky is not the limit, bitch I’m building starscrapers
Got the cigar paper, put the weed in it
Hittin warp drive, and passin’ the speed limits
Reppin’ 203 they know these digits
Tatted on my ribs so CT with it
Skinny as a motherfucker still I rep the Huskies
I’m through the roof now bitch no one’s above me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I’ve been through the roof, Now I’m through the Stratosphere
Millennium falcon, hyper drive and I’m outta here
Got my light saber in hand
Been on the grind since before Diddy decided he was making a band
Now I’m here shakin’ hands with fans, and it’s about time
Defying gravity smokin’ bogies on cloud nine, high
That’s how I’ve always gotta be
Fuckin’ human oddity, always burning it down properly
So bring the pot to me, and Webby’s gonna roll a dutch
Piss test, shit, take a week for me to sober up
Ain’t no need for spellin’ it out
I’m through the roof like a fuckin tree fell in your house, bitch

[Hook]

And I can’t get no higher than I am (x4)

[Verse 3]
I can’t get no higher than I am
Captain Fire up, always got a lighter in my hand
Carry so much tree that my pockets turn green
On some Tom Hanks shit, Apollo 13
Cleaner than the cut on school picture day
They tryna to step to C-Webb, cool pick a day
I’ll be there to show you up, keep my jaw loaded up
Roll it up, blow a dutch
Spit it hella dope, hoody always smell of smoke
They can’t even see me with a telescope
Think your umbrella broke, I make it rain bitch
Ask El Roca he’ll tell you the same shit
It’s that crazy motherfucker from YouTube
Tryna see how many cells in my brain I could lose dude
My minds out to sea, on a booze cruise
I’m through the floor boards, I’m through the roof too

[Hook]

And I can’t get no higher than I am (x4)



Yup, I’m back
Round two mothafucka
Chris Webby

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yo, it’s the Teenage Mutant Ninja Rapper, you don’t wanna start bro
The combination of Donatello and Leonardo
Michelangelo and Raph rolled into one
With the knowledge of Master Splinter, so Shredder is done (Finish him)
Coppin’ pizza by the box
I’m the new creature on the block, no beatin’ what I got
And I’m heatin’ up the spot
The way I rip it on the mic even Jesus gotta watch
Reachin’ to the top, battlin’ the villains
And a court case, cause they tryna’ send me to prison
I’m the illest white dude that ya never heard
I’m the shit, for lack of a better word
I’m a dog like a boxer or a pug
Bout to make a splash in the game, got water in the tub
And I thought you were a thug
But then they scared to battle me cause I could squash em like a bug
Mixin’ 5-hour energy with Hennessy
Mind so fcked up I can’t even remember me
Spit it doper rhyme, homie I am so defined
Rollin’ up more joints than a cobra's spine
I am the master of the metaphors
Rip it from Connecticut, Australia to Ecuador
Settle scores easy, I do not try
I just put one in the air like carbon dioxide
I’m Popeye after digestin' a can of spinach
I’m handlin’ business, say more in a sec than you can in a minute
Animalistic, you cannot attack this
One punch make em back flip the fuck off the atlas
I’m a Tempur-Pedic mattress, I’ll leave an impression
Danny Glover with the lethalest weapon
Come back and I gotsta get it
Joints rolled so big you think a Rasta did it
Sippin’ on some Jell-O shots with some vodka in it
Known for notoriety, I’m Big Papa with it
So now listen up to ya boy
Roll one up, kick ya feet up, sit back and enjoy
Uh



If that's true, If you don't know who I am, then maybe the best course would be to tread lightly

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Listen bitch
Better tread lightly, I put 'em to bed nightly
You'll never see me tired, and losing is less likely
I got the haters mad because their chick is my next wifey
(Keep talking) I don't care if i got your respect, bite me
Y'all think that people up and Connecticut can't rap
Well watch as me and Ap' go and put an end to that
While these other rappers counting their chickens before they hatch
I said fuck it, and made them over easy with some hash
(Oh My God he's on the drugs again) Urine so dirty
Only at my local deli am I going cold turkey
So much musical knowledge they're asking if I went to Berklee
Leaving third degree burns on the microphone until they heard me
I roll around with eighteen birdies, and I ain't playing golf
Just them Kit-Kat bitches, I got to break them off
Got them breathing heavy as Vader giving a monologue
Mazel-tov, Wolf in the game, you just a common dog
I don't even care
My name be ringing bells like Hector Salamanca with dynamite in his wheelchair
So get right, C. Webby is dead nice
You don't know me so trust me bitch, just tread light

[Hook: Chris Webby]
If you don't know me, you better tred light
Oh you people got a lot to say, well okay step up to the mic
(Step, Step up, Step up)
But you ain't my homie, so i'm not gonna play nice
All I need is sixteen bars, swear to God I could end your life
(Take that motherfuckers)

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Shatter matter, at a rate the fake evaporate
Evacuate the wake, then lay the body, I decapitate
I take the head, take you to the hood of my whip
Foot on the metal wood and grip, floating like a wooden ship
Shouldn't shitty rappers ask us permission to rhyme?
Permission declined, the mics booby trapped with fishing line
Finna' shine since a fetus, I can see the finish line
Vicious mind, victims lying in blood when I split your spine
Now I'm spying on these bitches showing titties on Vine
Looking pretty, hoes pose in front of Hollywood signs
If it comes to Me and You, you lose every time
I been deadly with the rhymes since Nirvana Nevermind
Never whine, never crying, never dying, I'm designed
Out of iron, I'm a lion, I'm defined as divine
I'm Allah, I'm Jehovah, Amen-rah, I'm a soldier
I'm a boulder-moving mutant, super human, shit is over
Supernova, super soaker full of acid, I'm blasting
I'm blacking out, passing out laughing at the fact that you rapping
I'm rapidly cracking you crackers into cabbages for bragging
I'm body bagging hoes, y'all shorter then Bilbo Baggins

[Hook: Chris Webby]
If you don't know me, you better tred light
Oh you people got a lot to say, well okay step up to the mic
(Step, Step up, Step up)
But you ain't my homie, so i'm not gonna play nice
All I need is sixteen bars, swear to God I could end your life
(Take that motherfuckers)



[Intro]
'Cause you know I'm spitting heat every time I hit the beat
'Cause I am a monster every day I trick or treat
'Cause you know I'm spitting heat every time I hit the beat
'Cause I am a monster every day I trick or treat

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I just run raps trust me, been there done that
I don't make the guns clap, but sharper than a thumbtack
What's that? Homie outta private school rhyming fools
Under the table, since the cradle I've been trying to
Kill it with this rhyming shit, hit em' with a flying fist
One punch take 'em off their feet like a podiatrist
I am sick, you're just a giant vagina, try me bitch
I'll lead you to the lion's den, then tell you what time it is
No one is as fly as this, I just grab the mic n' spit
Fuck dumb rappers I'm a rocket scientist
Flowing since sixth grade, you know I'm on it now
Shit I am a monster, my crib is a haunted house
Rollin' with goblins, ghouls and vampires
Me and Frankenstein lighting it up like campfires
Putting in work, I'm a monster til the dirt
Living every single day like October 31st

[Hook]
So trick or treat bitch, trick or treat bitch
All day running up and down your street bitch
So trick or treat bitch, trick or treat bitch
'Cause I'm a monster boy, trick or treat bitch
So trick or treat bitch, trick or treat bitch
All day running up and down your street bitch
So trick or treat bitch, trick or treat bitch
'Cause I'm a monster boy, trick or treat bitch

[Verse 2: Tim Gallo]
I find a bitch and I be in the sack for hours
'Cause I fuck like I got supernatural powers
So if I'm a get the cheeks, they gon' get dick
'Cause I always get treats and I never get tricked
When they put on the beat they say I'm a different guy
Like I dropped Doc Jekyll and switched to Mr. Hyde
Said I'm a monster like the spawn of Satan
Strong arm the leprechaun and get it on with Jason
I'm a ghoulish motherfucker, what I need with a goblin
Trip shrooms on witches' brooms, stash weed in a cauldron
Till I bleed in a coffin precede it with caution
Because you need to get off him
And so often, bring taste to mixtapes
Spit fire at Mike Myers, I'm flyer than ring wraiths
So fuck bein' a monster, I'm a Monstar
Trick or treat, I'm the reason you're afraid of the dark

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I'm the white boy wonder, drinking age under
Number one stunner who's cool as a cucumber
Thunder, lightnin', mythological Titan
With fire in his eyes and a bite like Tyson
Bark of a werewolf leave your ass frightened
With mics I ignite the site big as a bison
Anyone'll fight in my squad
Find me on monster.com, not looking for a job
Put out hits like I was working for the mob
With a bottle in my hand and a tendency to rob
Like zombie, watch me I'm a kamikaze
Monster hard body since I learned to use a potty
I'm naughty by nature, darker than Darth Vader
A saber-toothed tiger, bye see ya later
Van Helsing couldn't even fuck with me
I'm a monster with the ink so fuck Disney

[Hook]



[Intro]
See you guys, you never listen to me!
I said there was gonna be trouble but you didn't listen to me!
You guys are crazy!

A Kato Production

Yeahhh, Webster!

Ya Ya... Ya Ya Ya Ya, ye yeye ye yeye ye
Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya... Ya Ya

[Verse 1]
There's about to be some mother fucking trouble when i'm stepping out the huddle
Got these bitches shaking it like they doing the truffle shuffle
All the dudes up in the spot are steady bobbin they head
Hanging on to every fucking syllable that I said
Got a double shot of whiskey on ice, Tara Lipinski
But fuck i've been drinking so much that shit'll barely hit me
Pop a zanny and go 0-60 until i'm blacking out
Wake up in jail and call my cousin Vinny
I'm a skinny guinea, tattoos on my skin? Shit, I got plenty
Brain cells in my head? I'm missing many
I've lost it already, if you coming at Webby
You better come correct or shit, it's right with his head, B
Do them like Marie Antoinette, when I slam the set
A handsome vet, that's why your girls pants are wet
My competition ain't gon even have a chance to sweat
Cause now i'm on, and their plans are wrecked!

[Hook]
There's about to be trouble, there's about to be trouble, there's about to be trouble, there's about to be trouble
Homie that's a fact (homie that's a fact)
There's about to be trouble, there's about to be trouble, there's about to be trouble, there's about to be trouble
You can count on that! (you can count on that)

[Verse 2]
I'm cold as Mr. Frosty, icicles be falling off me
Flowin' potent as the poison that they slipped to king Jeoffrey
Wake up and get to work until my cereal is soggy
'cuz i'm... out on my hustle got these haters so salty
That their sodium levels are through the roof
You would think they were drinking ocean water, really to tell you the truth!
I've fuckin had it with these kids that criticize what I do
Come and see me, you'll end up on the sole of my shoe
'cuz see at first I as ight, but I got better with practice
Now i'm only fucking chicks that look like Jessica Rabbit
Shit i've been crazy since I first opened the medicine cabinet
Experimented now I got a hell of a habit (na na)
Yo i'm kidding I exaggerate the truth, cuz...
Mom, if you're listening I swear I don't do drugs!
I had my fingers crossed, homie pass the weed
And if you want trouble follow me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Baby i'm a trouble maker
That's just always how it's been, ima be one to the end
Tell em baby i'm a trouble maker
That's just what i am, don't make me say it again

[Verse 3]
I've been insane in the head...since I played in a pin
Now i'm on the mic, see yo the game has began
All my enemies just started shakin' and ran
Fuck it ill just let em marinade in the pan
Now Ya you know i'm about to eat these mother fuckers with a fork and a spoon
One with the force you can feel it when i walk in the room
I'm coming out the temple of doom
So dirty i need to be swept with a broom
My foots up on the peddle and VROOM!
The quarterback, yeah of course i'm back
Homie and it's more than rap
Shit i'm so sharp the microphone's got a sword attached
Hey you Luca Brasi's heading where the dolphins at
Better bring your motherfucking snorkel mask



[Hook:]
Baby I'm a trouble maker
That's just always how it's been, I'm a be one till the end
Cause you know that I'm a trouble maker
And that's just how I do, I don't listen to the rules
Cause you know that I'm a trouble maker
Not givin' one fuck with my middle fingers up
Cause you know that I'm a trouble maker
And that's just how it is, that's just how it is

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Causin' trouble's in my DNA, part of me
Pardon me, rebellion runs deep in every artery
Hardly, containable aimin' like archery
With more screws loose than poor carpentry
My armor be, heavier than Lancelot
All I need's a gram of pot
And I will cause a ruckus that you couldn't even stand to watch
Cause I just have complete lack of discipline
Beat up any citizen who steps within an inch of him
Me like Leif Ericson, steal, plunderin', pillagin'
Every village, I'm a villain like Cruella Deville and them
On so much Ritalin, my mind's lost at sea just like Gilligan
Then step back to reality, pop another pill again
Wow, I'm just continually killin' them
Cause I'm nothin' but trouble, or any one of it's synonyms
And yeah I know that I'm a cocky fuck
But I'll be wreakin' havoc till they lock me up

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Chris Webby]
You see it started at detention then it moved into suspension
Then expulsion and arrest with a possible jail sentence
But I flow hot, body tight, harder than a robot
Port to starboard, I'm a make the fuckin' boat rock
I inhaled a whole crop since I started to smoke pot
Got my brain baked on the stove top
I spit sick, I'm speakin' the flu
Helen Keller couldn't see me, and neither can you
I'm a trouble maker, you don't gotta tell me I'm wild
I step in and every drug dog can smell me for miles
I'm an intelligent child, deep down I'm not bad bro
But trouble's always followin' me, somethin' like a shadow
So I chose to rap yo, causin a fiasco
Hotter than Tabasco or burnin' tobacco
Start learnin' the facts yo, I am on my hustle
Girls look me up and down and say I look like trouble

[Hook]



[Intro]
I can’t tell if I love you baby

[Hook]
I can’t tell if I love you baby
I don’t know if I should take that chance
‘Cause even though you drive me crazy
I can’t seem to stay out of yo’ pants
So you could be my lady
And I’ma be yo’ tramp
Yeah you out on the run
Intoxicated by the true romance, that true romance, ay
Faded off that true romance, that true romance, ay
So high from the true romance, that true romance, ay
Been on that true romance, that true romance, ay

[Verse 1]
You drive me nuts with that catnip girl
Lay you down on that mattress girl
Saw that ass and I knew I had to have it girl
Quit playin’ games, you ain’t Katniss, girl
Sex until it’s early like you just ain’t got no worries
You and me out on the run, you my Alabama Worley
I’m gettin’ a rubber and then I’ma fuck her
From what I’ve heard I’m a hell of a lover
A bit of a dog I guess, ay
Shout out to all of my eskimo brothers I’m showin’ you what I discovered in yoga
Hittin’ that pussy in lots of ways
Downward dog and turn you over, till you screamin’, “Namaste”

[Hook]
I can’t tell if I love you baby
I don’t know if I should take that chance
‘Cause even though you drive me crazy
I can’t seem to stay out of yo’ pants
So you could be my lady
And I’ma be yo’ tramp
Yeah you out on the run
Intoxicated by the true romance, that true romance, ay
Faded off that true romance, that true romance, ay
So high from the true romance, that true romance, ay
Been on that true romance, that true romance, ay

[Verse 2]
It’s that true romance I, feel like I’m so damn high
Rub my fingers down yo’ spine and grab you by yo’ tan lines
I got a dirty mind, I can’t clean it up
Listen girl, you just really gotta teach me what you really want
So I know how to beat it up
No need to be shy with the freaky stuff
Baby I don’t want the key to your heart
I want you up in the back seat of my car
I’m not like all guys that you meet at the bar
Come to my world you’ll be back by tomorrow
Singin', “Aw, nah, hell nah, y’all been up and gunnin’ now”
And I don’t gotta be your boyfriend, let’s just fuck around because

[Hook]
I can’t tell if I love you baby
I don’t know if I should take that chance
‘Cause even though you drive me crazy
I can’t seem to stay out of yo’ pants
So you could be my lady
And I’ma be yo’ tramp
Yeah you out on the run
Intoxicated by the true romance, that true romance, ay
Faded off that true romance, that true romance, ay
So high from the true romance, that true romance, ay
Been on that true romance, that true romance, ay



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm a punchline professional, far from conventional
Always make a point, like what comes right before a decimal
I never ate my vegetables, skipped out of pre-school
Spit molten lava, ain't a second I could be cool
I'm nasty, so come right at me
I get fresh to death, shit I'm great like Gatsby
My voice stays raspy, the ladies like it
They always jock my swagger and tell me that I'm the nicest
I'm righteous, so who fuckin' with Webster?
Stay bangin' out tracks in the lab like Dexter
I'm clever, everyday under pressure
Bow down to King Mathers, but I am his successor
An MC like Escher, fresh, flyer than feathers
Rollin' up the trees then light up like a projector
I'm better, bitch, trust me
I'm Super Mario with a star, cause y'all can't touch me

[Hook: Chris Webby]
You can never be the man that I'll be
Never go to war with a dude like me
You'll be barking up the wrong tree, trust me
You can never do the things that I do
You never spit the words that I spew
You can never stand or walk in my shoes, trust me

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
You'd be barkin' up the wrong tree, barkin' at the wrong dog
Power walkin' around you motherfuckers at full charge
I go hard, shit, I'm oh so sick
I'm loco, bitch, eat rappers like coco crisp
And get it jumpin' like a pogo stick, nobody next to this
I've been rappin' since Sonic was running on Sega Genesis
Oh, I'll throw knuckles like his nemesis, now who can step to Chris?
I'm so fly, I got a leg up on Pegasus
Put together sentences, verses to the choruses
On the underground like bones of stegasauruses
My kicks harder than Chuck Norris's
One roundhouse will knock you all the way to places that you're foreign with
I'm rollin' with at least three ninjas, call me Colt
But bitches call me the Carpenter, I screw, nut and bolt
I won't just give up, and don't just back down
And don't give two fucks, y'all know all that now

[Hook: Chris Webby]
You can never be the man that I'll be
Never go to war with a dude like me
You'll be barking up the wrong tree, trust me
You can never do the things that I do
You never spit the words that I spew
You can never stand or walk in my shoes, trust me

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I'm a motherfucker animal, squirter full of cannonballs
Playing drinking games, 'til I hardly even stand at all
I bite bitches like True Blood, this dudes rough
Brain screwed up, from too much drugs, I never grew up
Drink until I threw up, throw up, vomit
Barf on the game, you bitches don't really want it
Sorry, homeboy, but do not interrupt me
I'm better at rapping than you bitch, trust me

[Hook: Chris Webby]
You can never be the man that I'll be
Never go to war with a dude like me
You'll be barking up the wrong tree, trust me
You can never do the things that I do
You never spit the words that I spew
You can never stand or walk in my shoes, trust me



[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Like nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
C Web in the booth and I speak it real
Got another beat to kill
And I be roasting motherfuckers
Rest In Peace Patrice O'Neil
Roll up another blunt
Now how that Diesel feel?
Got me swerving man
Who the fuck gave me the wheel?
Who the fuck gave me these pills?
Now I'm off in another dimension
In need of an intervention
Cause these drugs are too fucking expensive
But I'm feeling terrific dude
Banging these broads with no fucking protection
Yeah, what were you saying babe?
I wasn't paying any fucking attention
Rumbling engine, rolling up in my Camaro and cruise
Living it like a pirate man
Always got me a barrel of booze
Skipping the food
Go right for the tiramisu
Sippin' and rippin' the bubbler
Puffing until I can barely move
Lay back and then stare at the moon, ooh
Bippidy bobbidy boo
Webby be rippin' it properly too
Hipping and hopping and rambling shit
Cause these pills I've been popping have got me confused
Screwed up, burn it down
Light it up, pass it around
I'm a bad boy bitch
You didn't know? You know it now

[Hook]
We just doin' what we doin', and we'll never give a fuck
Put some liquor in my bottle and some ganja rolled up
We just livin' like whatever and we'll never have enough
Bout to get this motherfucker turned up (turned up)

Like nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I'm not the one you want a problem with
Positive, you better follow it
Swear I'm ready for whatever standing in front of my mirror
Supporting my confidence
A little weed, you could throw it on top of this
We get it poppin', yo bitch gettin' topless
Now that you know, niggas adopting the flow
Niggas can't stop this shit
The problem is we won't acknowledge it
But me and Webby (I wanna get that)
If that nigga wanna get mad, sit up and get up
And fuck that (get that)
Now I'm playing like a kid on the black top
Got the juice with a flat top
You got a flat face
Bad boy, it's a bad day
Look at me sideways, and I'mma hit you with a uppercut
Too cold, better bundle up
Huddle up cause we comin' up
Turnt up, finna fuck it up
I guarantee that the crowd go crazy
When I hit the stage, you could bet a hunnit bucks
Boy we out here grindin'
Smoking the finest, getting the highest
Getting the mommas, you know when I'm coming
Just smell for the ganja
Vegas; soldierz, takin' over
Traveling and taking shots
Tattoo shops, don't forget the place to rock
I need a nasty girl to taste the cock
In the office, running all over these niggas
Like bitches, you niggas is softer than niggas
That just got to prison, this Project X shit is real
Somebody pass the god damn liquor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
That rap phenomenon
Inked up, looking like Comic Con, Rasta mon
H.A.M. on the mic, no Ramadan
Go on and on, and leave with a soccer mom
Cause I kill that beat
Roll one up in that Swisher Sweet
Sticky green, sticky green
With orange hairs, like Pete and Pete
Flowing double time when I freak the beat
Holding up mine when I hit the street
Burn so much, I be high for weeks
Spit it so dirty, I need new sheets
My grinder's full, and I ain't talkin turkey, cheese
I'm talking AK47, Purple Kush and Sour D
Put it in the bowl, I'll get a dutchie rolled
Sprinkle some keef on it, and then away we go
Get in the flow, lighting up heady to dro
Partying on, got that confetti to throw
Killing the spot from the moment
That Webby'll step in the door
Hit some shit, got my pencil gripped
Instrumental ripped, living life
Above the law, and way under the influence
Getting mine while the price high
What can I say? I'm pretty fly for a white guy

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
See
We been on that La La La since '08, combine strains and taste
LeBron James of vaping, volcano blazing bongs with no breaks
Edibles on plates till I'm beyond baked
And I be on and it indica got me gone
Got that wax that you can't feel your body on
Yeah That shit that you moving slow is a zombie on
High as a cosmonaut never gon catch me not smoking
The best hit my chest and I take the whole rip
Fuck a 20 bag I'll take the whole zip
Even if the federal government oppose it
I say fuck it and grab another nugget and puff it in public
Weed naps on my back like a Snorlax
Highest alien, bouncing off of the ceiling
I need it up in my system the minute that I record that
Loud packed in a Raw wrap
Yeah

[Chorus]
Let's twist again, like we did last summer
Let's twist again, until we all get high
I still remember when "I got the weed mans number"
So lets twist again, until we learn to fly
Yeah, let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)

[Verse 2]
Still rollin' to the diner with my half off coupon
Bacon grilled cheese and you know I get my soup on
Still up on that Jimmy Neutron, got the boost on
In my spaceship, lean back in a futon
Whoa, even when I'm seeing the cops
I chief pot, whether they gon' make it legal or not
'Cause see I smoke for recreation before it was recreational
Take a pull, now the euphoria is undebatable
My terpene so aromatic
Yeah, you can smell it from my parents attic
To the basement 'til they say, "Chris, light an incense
Or use some of that spray shit
Fuck, I can't take this! For Christ sake
You're 28, give me a break!" (Alright mom)
Then I go back to gettin' baked
Higher than Towelie up on a balcony
And smoking hourly and burning the Sour D like a calorie

[Chorus]
Let's twist again, like we did last summer
Let's twist again, until we all get high
I still remember when "I got the weed mans number"
So let's twist again, until we learn to fly
Yeah, let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)

[Verse 3]
When that wax pen is in action
And the smoke fill the room like Mad Men
With those hash blends, I'm like Captain
Kirk, when I get the purp I am blastin'
Off, 'til I'm lost in the stars, never come down
Light my blunts with the sun now
Snuffin' out the bud like a blood hound
I'm chemically imbalanced, roll a doobie and I puff now
So I'm sayin', "Who got the lighter? Who got the lighter?"
Say, "Who got the lighter? Who got the lighter?"
Yeah, "Who got the lighter? Who got the lighter?"
No, for real, who got my fuckin' lighter?
I need that fire from the Bic just to calm me
And the chronic goes so strong
Hoodie smelling like it's Snoop Dogg's laundry
Twist like Chubby Checker
There's nothing better on God's green
Roll the palm trees and I'm gone, peace

[Chorus]
Let's twist again, like we did last summer
Let's twist again, until we all get high
I still remember when "I got the weed mans number"
So lets twist again, 'til we learn to fly
Yeah, Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)



[Intro: Madi Wolf]
Welcome to the university of life now
If you didn't know before then you gon' find out

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Welcome to the university of life
Gather 'round and take a seat students, I'm your substitute for the night
'Cause you might think you're doin' it right, I thought it too
Up until I learned my lesson, now it's the lesson plan that I offer you
Study history, learn from the mistakes of those who came before you
So you can make it through life differently and take economics, a business class if you got it
Had to learn that for myself when people got up in my pockets
'Cause the school of hard-knocks is full of roadblocks and potholes
And semester after semester life is a long road
You gotta take some risks but if you livin' dangerous
Just know that there's consequences for the way you live
Because expulsion from life is permanent
Ain't no principals offices, church services
So for all my fallen classmates I tip this bottle of bourbon and pour it out
As I question what this life is all about
That's when they told me

[Chorus: Madi Wolf & Chris Webby]
Welcome to the university of life now
If you didn't know before then you gon' find out
This is real life, don't be surprised how
Now you're all grown up Welcome to the
Welcome to the university of life now
If you didn't know before then you gon' find out
This is real life, don't be surprised how
Now you're all grown up

[Verse 2]
Gotta study psychology so you readin' people properly
And learn to see the world through the perspective of philosophy
I've always loved anatomy, I mean understandably
But I played it safe 'cause I ain't ready for family
'Cause I'm still working on myself and that's the mission
As taxes in my business' expenses became tuition
Ain't no wishin' on a star, real life comes at a cost
So crawl before you walk and listen more than you talk
Take your lessons as a blessing, raise ya hand and ask questions
We all got ADD but pay attention
No prisons or no testin' that could give you preparation
Live with zero hesitation, yo this life is what you make it
Gotta take it, any records that they set just go and break it
I'd rather have detention than follow and be complacent
'Cause when I hit my lowest and started losin' focus
And everything around me seemed hopeless
That's when they told me

[Chorus: Madi Wolf & Chris Webby]
Welcome to the university of life now
If you didn't know before then you 'gon find out
This is real life, don't be surprised how
Now you're all grown up (Welcome to the)
Welcome to the university of life now
If you didn't know before then you 'gon find out
This is real life, don't be surprised how
Now you're all grown up

[Outro: Madi Wolf]
Yeah, keep that sunshine on my side
So I know it's 'gon be alright, follow me and Ima be your guide
Leave your worries behind yeah
These mistakes that I'm takin' home
Taught me everythin' I know, Now I'm here to help you grow. whoah woah yeah

[Outro: Madi Wolf]
Welcome to the university of life now
If you didn't know before then you 'gon find out
This is real life.. don't be surprised how now your all grown up



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I started in the game on the grind and I still am
All of it off a sweat on my back without a deal man
Spit it real, and treat em like protected areas in Alaska
Cause they about to know the drill man
So fuckin' illy that I got to pop a pill again
Adderall XR 20 or 30 milligrams
Gotta stay focused in the land of opportunity
Prepared for any twist and turn that anybody threw at me
Grew to be a beast learned it all up in the cypher
All off the top slaughtered 90% of you writers
Regardless of my fuckin' heritage and nationality
I grew up decapitating anybody who battled me
Rappin' rapidly ain't nobody be lappin' me
Jackie Joyner-Kersee 26 paces in back of me
An alcoholic but fuck it homie I'd rather be
Liquored up not givin' a fuck and livin' lavishly
On the go hard diet I burn calories
Setting fire to mics til the melted plastic and ash you see
I've lost my marbles somebody should straight jacket me
Latch it and throw the key in the deepest part of the blackest sea
Toss me on an island like fuckin' Survivor casted me
And still I'll make it back and make every hater a casualty
Running Connecticut, shouts to my homie Apathy
And shouts to everyone who supported me on my path to be
Successful in one way or an other cause grammatically
They know no one could fuck with my metaphorical masterpiece
Got the fuckin' Grim Reaper coming after me
The good die young someone show me where the casket be

[Hook: Daniel Zavaro]
I keep on moving forward
With my head held high
I do this shit forever or at least until I die
Ain't no use in stopping
I got nothing left to hide
I do this shit forever
You couldn't stop me if you tried

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Nobody fuckin' with my flow man
Modern day Conan, swords swingin' in both hands
Hip-Hop is all I know man
Bang bitches to Chronic 2001 motherfuckin' Slow Jam
Keep grindin' til the day that Webby holds the belt
Make my haters sit the fuck down, Franky Roosevelt
With that polio flow homie I'm dope as hell
Captain of my movement and I'm treatin' all of my soldiers well
My fans know I won't give rhymin' a rest
And I mean that, from the left side of my chest
I got heart, so all you motherfuckers step your game up
Me with a microphone is like Bob Ross with a paint brush
All you lame fucks gettin' pummeled from the waist up
I don't need a cheap shot to leave your raps laid up
Shane Mosley with punches fuckin' your face up
Eatin' at roofs Chris now let me raise the stakes up

[Hook x2]



[Hook: Chris Webby]
Just vibe to it, watch how I do it
Rolling windows down, and then ride to it
Dealing with the seat back, and recline to it
Just turn the volume high, and then vibe to it
Now vibe to it, watch how I do it
Turn it up, and party the whole night to it
Throw some weed in the bong, and get high to it
Just turn the volume high and then vibe to it

[Verse 1: Sap]
I keeps a bunch of different colored hoes, yo I miss match
Homies outside of my clique that carry click-clack
Got ‘em sayin’ I’m the truth ‘cause I spit facts
So these niggas really can’t see me like it’s pitch black
Nigga, this that, oh you runnin’ shit? I missed that
The tables turned, now you wonder where your bitch at
They like, “Sap, we know you do it, don’t overdo it”
‘Cause I’m bringin’ way too much liquor to the kick back
Hoes love me like Denzel in '05
I trust no ho, doin’ well with no job
That weak shit you makin’ requires a slow nod
You beggin’ for spares, niggas get played with no prob
Just because they know I’m, dope with no cosign
Screamin’, “Sap it’s yo time, turn this into show time”
But step back and let me do just that
I’m getting’ off like I do just rap, so turn it up and just

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Vibe to it, watch how I do it
Rolling windows down, and then ride to it
Dealing with the seat back, and recline to it
Just turn the volume high, and then vibe to it
Now vibe to it, watch how I do it
Turn it up, and party the whole night to it
Throw some weed in the bong, and get high to it
Just turn the volume high and then vibe to it

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
See the white boy back up in this bitch, and now I’m 2.0
And ain’t nobody makin’ all the fuckin’ noise that I be
Drive real slow with them seats down low
Rims shinin’ like the leaves on poison ivy
Smoke is all up in my vehicle so, you know I be gettin’ bent like origami
But this life of mine is like Life of Pi
Yeah, I gotta hang tough when the water choppy
Vibe to it, I’m the vibrator, ‘bout to blow so big I’ma leave behind craters
Tell ‘em, “Hi hater”
If you like it or not, my song’s stuck in your head like I wrote ‘em on fly paper
Ain’t no time taken stressed out
We turnin’ up until your head bounce
And burn another from my fresh ounce
Vibe right and I’m takin’ it slow, doin’ me the only way that I know
So everybody go and

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Vibe to it, watch how I do it
Rolling windows down, and then ride to it
Dealing with the seat back, and recline to it
Just turn the volume high, and then vibe to it
Now vibe to it, watch how I do it
Turn it up, and party the whole night to it
Throw some weed in the bong, and get high to it
Just turn the volume high and then vibe to it

[Outro: Chris Webby] (x5)
Vibe to it



[Intro: Chris Webby]
Yeah !
See, listen up girl
You look good and all but
I gotta make my money
Gotta have priorities you know

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
It’s a very big world with a lot of bad bitches
But I ain’t never met one like you
But there's money to be made and I’m really tryin' to get it
So baby, what I need you to do?

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Bitch you gotta, wait a minute, wait a minute
I got no fucking time you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You see I’m out here on the grind you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Yeah bitch I know you fine but you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
There’s a woman that I love and she gave birth to me in 88
Aside from all these bitches all come second to the paper chase
Not to sound conceited but I work my fucking ass off
I'll be a dumb motherfucker if I let the women take away from me stacking all of my cash dawg
That’s all, end of story
You're good in bed and all but making money's mandatory
So salute the captain when I come through when I rip the rappin'
Got money on my mind it’s time to make it happen
Aside from the attraction you ain’t shit but a distraction
So just sit there and relax while I work on bringin' this cash in
Now that I got a taste of it, I just can’t stay away from it
This ain't me selling out, this is me on my makin' paper shit

[Bridge]
It's a very big world with a lot of bad bitches
But I ain’t never met one like you
But there's money to be made and I’m really tryin' to get it
So baby, what I need you to do ?

[Hook]
Bitch you gotta, wait a minute, wait a minute
I got no fucking time you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You see I’m out here on the grind you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Yeah bitch I know you fine but you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I need a second, we could work it out
Wait a minute, get it girl give me some time
I’m bout my money, on the grind 25 A spring
Summer winters snow nice sunny on
I just need you to be my ride or die
You know where I’m going, getting money is the alibi
Maybe when I hit a hundred mili I’ll be satisfied
Till then, gotta keep it rolling get your camera time
All that gotta hit the road jack
Why you’re acting crazy ? Think you need some Prozac
I know how them hoes act, and I leave em' alone so
You should know, who the star ? Girl it’s your show

[Bridge]
It’s a very big world with a lot of bad bitches
But I ain’t never met one like you
But there's money to be made and I’m really tryin' to get it
So baby, what I need you to do ?

[Hook]
Bitch you gotta, wait a minute, wait a minute
I got no fucking time you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You see I’m out here on the grind you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Yeah bitch I know you fine but you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Now as the world keeps revolvin' and the planet keeps rotatin'
Got my eyes on the prize and only sucka niggas hatin'
I’m posted in the Lamb, man I’m putting in the time
If I’m tryin get the tickets so our stack is there to shine
It’s people on the sidelines, waiting for a chance
To be here in the starting lineup with the rock up in their hands
All I needed was a shot, but nobody ever gave me one
So I got tired of waitin' on it and went and made me one
Now I’m in the game, fuck the fortune and the pain
Don’t get caught up in the pleasant lights and banners with your name
It’s all here today then it’s all gone tomorrow
In the clubs you made it rain, they won't let you come back and borrow

[Bridge]
It’s a very big world with a lot of bad bitches
But I ain’t never met one like you, like you
But there's money to be made and I’m really tryin' to get it
So baby what I need you to do

[Hook]
Bitch you gotta, wait a minute, wait a minute
I got no fucking time you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You see I’m out here on the grind you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Yeah bitch I know you fine but you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah



Yeah, check it
It's my life
It's my life

[Verse 1: Danimal Lector]
I can't go every day with being sober
It gets kind of hard trying to cope with this devil on my shoulder
Belve and some soda
Like well I'm getting closer to either heaven or hell
Every second I get older
Till I'm dead or in a coma I'mma live life like well
It ain't over till it's over
You're supposed to live every day like it was your last
But that and itself is a really hard concept for me to grasp
Cause if this was my last 24
I'd probably spend at least 3 or 4 praying to God for 20 more
I'm looking in the mirror at the man in front of me
Like I know everybody goes, but I'm 23
That's why I come off as reckless, respect it
I'm getting my moneys worth every second
I'm less than perfect, but so are you
So who are you to judge me? I don't judge you, yeah

[Hook]
(I'm not sober all the time
And you bring me down
At least you try
But till we see this eye to eye
I don't want you.)
[X2]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
What's life? Fuck life, yo I'm telling you what
I'm a nineteen year old rebellious fuck
Living each day like the next I might not wake up
That's why I always stay puffin' a blunt with a full cup
Poppin' pills out the bottle till it's hollow
I'm going to hell and y'all are more than welcome to follow
And if I'm not here tomorrow light an L in my memory
Pour out some Hennessy, fuck it, just remember me
Gotta know I made a mark on the short time I'm on Earth
Since birth I've been spittin' it, proving my fucking worth
And for what?
I try to give a fuck but I can't
Cause it sucks to be me, but I am who I am
And I am just a man who will stand with his hands in front of him
Just waiting for some shit to hit the fan
And I cannot stop, music fuels my every movement
And drug abusing helps bring creativity to my music
I may not be into a reality, but my music is sick
And I'm so high that I defy gravity
So fuck being sober, live life and enjoy it
Yeah, cause soon enough the ride will be over



[Chorus: Chris Webby & (Sap)]
(Now you may know me as Sap)
(I'm the man behind the science)
(And Webby's the supplier)
See that he be sampleing the instruments
I pack it and distribute it to give you that fire
(Ay yo, we stay cooking up)
(We stay in the lab, we turn up the heat)
(Keep playing it back so really none of y'all can't stress me)
He got the beats, I got the bars
And when you put that shit together we are like Walt and Jesse!

[Verse 1: Chris Webby & (Sap)]
I was chilling up in South Beach kicking my feet up
Just got off tour trying to soak some UV's up
Album on the source, label situation freezed up
Then I saw Sap tweet, he was trying to cook some beats up!
Shit, that sounds right, look, I'mma grab the Jamo
Then I got the flight book, go and catch your plane bro!

(On my way Chris, you know that shit we make is so pure
Some of this clowns think they run us and they so sure
Cause when I'm here in the streets got me so bored
The fans don't need to hear no more
But hey we gon chop the world after this shit we pull
Do it for the check but first for the people
I always hear the question, "why Web ain't made freshman?"
Man you know how geeks in school be keeping seats full
So we skip class, quick fast, and hit the jaw
Zip back on some Chemically Imbalanced!)
For your bitch ass!
So wait a minute while we go and hit the skyline
Cause I'm gone, the only way to go is to the dark side
I do whatever I like, now it's a whole CD
Me and Sap up on the track it's so eazy!

[Chorus: Chris Webby & (Sap)]
(Now you may know me as Sap)
(I'm the man behind the science)
(And Webby's the supplier)
See that he be sampleing the instruments
I pack it and distribute it to give you that fire
(Ay yo, we stay cooking up)
(We stay in the lab, we turn up the heat)
(Keep playing it back so really none of y'all can't stress me)
He got the beats, I got the bars
And when you put that shit together we are like Walt and Jesse!

[Verse 2: Chris Webby & (Sap)]
Yo, Mr. White I need a beat!

(Webb I got you, get used to add an extra knock too, you know I got to
We 'bout to have the whole world buying this!)

Word? Lemme try a hit! Yeah, Science Bitch!

(You see we take a piece from the sample
Ain't a damn thing with my beats that we can't do
Got so many styles that we gon' have a handful
Of this customers I swear the whole net gon' fuck with us)

You call it the Internet, but I call it the trap
I push my product on the book, the gram and snapchat
When I run out, I pick up my phone and ask Sap
And we cooking it well, getting mail from ASCAP
Selling tapes out the trunk, then they gotta love bigger
Now the fans lining up hitting follow on twitter
I'mma DM this chick real quick, I'm trynna hit, you dig?

(Come on Webb you know we on the clock nigga!)

[Chorus: Chris Webby & (Sap)]
(Now you may know me as Sap)
(I'm the man behind the science)
(And Webby's the supplier)
See that he be sampleing the instruments
I pack it and distribute it to give you that fire
(Ay yo, we stay cooking up)
(We stay in the lab, we turn up the heat)
(Keep playing it back so really none of y'all can't stress me)
He got the beats, I got the bars
And when you put that shit together we are like Walt and Jesse!



[Sample]
Never let you out of my sight
Be it day, be it night
You belong to me, that's the way it will be wrong or right

[Intro: Chris Webby]
You belong to me now
It's just gotta be that way, you know?

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Listen hip-hop, I've been chasing you for quite sometime now
And now I got you where I want you, shit it's you and I now
You've been fucking around with every other dude
While I made all these mixtapes for you, listen boo
I'mma never let you down, I'mma roll for you
I would get on one knee and propose to you
Shit I've spent my whole life trying to prove that I was worthy
But if you ever cheat on me, your dead bitch, you heard me?
Huh, to see you fucking around with other dudes has got me going nutty
Because you know their only in it for the money
I would stand with you though think and thin
Bitch I hope you're listening
You got me second guessing the reality I'm living in
Because you're my way of life
Think about you day and night
Because of you now I finally got my paper right
But I've seen what you do to your other boyfriends
Build them up until their at the top and then destroy them
One minute your hot at the club popping Rosé
And next thing you know your scrubbing floors at Chipotle
Baby you're a bitch, yes I love you but I hate you
You think she's loyal for a second then she fucking plays you
Huh, a shot at you, I had to take it
Because you got me infatuated, I graduated from a nobody to a damn MC
And I'mma hold you down bitch you better stand by me
Yeah

[Hook]
You are my way of life
The only way I know
You are my way of life
I'll never let you go

[Verse 2: D. Lector]
This isn't music, it's a way of life
When haters bite
They pay the price
I'll take your mic
And stab your face in twice
But it ain't a 8-inch stainless knife
So say goodnight
I'll stay and fight
Like Dana White
The way I write
Is crazy hype
You say your nice
Uh, but we ain't alike
Ray of light
Playing a pipe
Just bent the game over
Never spent a day sober
So I've yet to catch a hangover
Ford Mustang frame with the train motor
I wanna change lives
You want a chain and a Range Rover
I gotta son, spending money I don't have yet
Mad stress, no assets
Just hope dreams and past debt
Trying to stack cheques and snap necks
Because I know cash rules everything around me, ask meth
I gotta get it, while I can before its too late
Fuck a cube steak
I just ate some dudes face
On Route 8
I'm super baked
Losing it, these bath salts stupid, zooted, jupalooted
Hip-hop why you diluted with this useless music?
I'm anti-radio, anti-autotune
Fuck that, I'm anti all of you
What's wrong with you to do what I was taught to do
Slaughtered cruse, Talking rude, hopper too (?)
But I feel fucking awesome dude
People often snooze, so why you daydream
I'm your worst nightmare, or at least it may seem
I've been screaming death to mainstream since I was eight teen
Mother fucker

[Hook]



[Hook]
If you don't give a fuck
Then I don't give a fuck
So we don't give a fuck
No we don't give a fuck
If you don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I don't give a fuck steppin' the party already sloppy
Adderall and E pills just watch me
Got my flippin' like rice and hibachi
Ninja turtle and the gorilla no one can stop me
Yo Zoe come here I think this chick wants to fuck you
Finish your beer I'm a take a little brunette friend
And pull my pants down and see if home girl has a handlin'
Full bag MDMA G's up hoes down till we roll for days
Doc says I got a hole in my brain
But I just need to rub a room mother fucker
Cause I'm flowin' insane
Split flames like a dragon what
Two balls so big I gotta drag my nuts
Trojan ultra thin I wrap it up
Now shorty come here and just back it up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]
Goin' to the party in an old school Chevy
Man young Chris Webby got yo bad ho ready
And the MDMA got her showin her titties
Shorty shake that shit
Want a god damn feely
Imma kill that pussy Die Hard Bruce Willis
Bring her home girl with you let two girls kiss it
It's a one night stand and I'm not gon' miss it
Hit a nigga on twitter I don't give a no didda
And I don't give a fuck like a virgin do
And I don't wanna fuck like some fuckin' too
Menage-a-trois y'all know I do
She say fuck me I wanna fuck her too
Turn it around baby tilt ya butt up
Talk too much shorty shut the fuck up
I brought you to the party just get you fucked up
And we can't give a fuck if you don't give a fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby + Gorilla Zoe]
I'm never givin' a fuck I'm livin' it up
Rem blowin' in my eye brow sippin' a cup
Me and Zoe now they picturin' us
Circus fucks stumblin' around
Lookin' for some bitches to fuck
They're like "Oh my god that's disrespectful! "
Don't blame me it's a mother fuckin' pencil
Get it in my hand and I go straight mental
Tiger blood runnin' through my veins like a Bengal
Didn't see this comin'
Then quick on the brake got the whole place jumpin'
Fuck you bitch I am not fist pumpin'
Middle finger in the air like fuck you dunnas
What? Now we don't give a fuck
See your middle fingers up
If you don't give a fuck

[Hook]



(Man, I don't even know what I'm doin in this mothafuckin booth right now)

Haha, let's go!

[Hook]
When you walk in the room, it is clear to see
I'm the one, with the bong, and the bag of weed
I'm a pothead, and everybody knows it's
So drop dead, if you will oppose it
I'm the one whose burnin'

[Verse 1]
Back by popular demand
Wait no not yet, no one even knows who I am
But I'm the White Noise and I'm kickin' it again
Kick em to the curb as I stick it to the man
Chris Webby, check the Johnathan Hancock
Walk around buzzed on Klonopin and pot
Got so many lyrics, when I drop it I can't stop
Find me a biddy and I'm watchin' her pants drop
Whoa, start unzipperin' now
There's no way I be simmerin down
But I be Donkey Kong, so I'm a hit em with a Simeon hound
And keep buzzin' like a sippian, wow
Now, Kowabunga
When I come and hit her from the under
Round make sound like thunder
White as the weather in a tundra
Stun ya, cause I rap it ill, It'll really make ya wonder

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm the illest white rapper on 20 muscle relaxers
Sniffin' anthrax just to feel the shit faster
I'm a fuckin' Jedi master no need for a blaster
My lightsaber will leave none standin' after
I swing it around and cut everyone to fractions
Sweep em in a pile then drive away laughin'
I think that I lost it, I can't explain my actions
Neither can the therapist, he says that I'm on crack
And I would have to agree cause I been smokin' that
Since I was like 6 sittin' on Santa's lap
Asking for my own prostitute and a bat
So I can knock her out and jerk off on her rack
A little animal is what the fuck I was
Poppin' Ritalin, tattlin', just to get a little buzz
Fuck, what was I even talking about? Uh...
Oh yeah, where was I? Kids, don't do drugs

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And that's why
My dutch
I've never had enough
So I'mma roll me up another once I finish this up
And that's why
My brain
Is now completely fucked
So I have no idea why I am even saying this stuff

[Verse 3]
I'm a young buck, fucked up, trashed like a dump truck
With bundles of Budda smellin' like a skunks butt
Slaughter any dumb fuck, messing with the come up
Like Mario with a green shroom, got 1 up
On anybody cause you know I flow it dope
Walk around with a cane, beatin' up older folks
I'm just looking for a pair of titties I can motorboat
Or a bottle of Penicillin so I can overdose
Comatose mothafucka and I'm on it, what ?
Raspy ass voice soundin' like Donald Duck
Mad Game, Crazy, rollin' with a lot of sluts
Pop so many pills, who will know what I could vomit up?
Hanukkah to Ramadan, I got a bomb tickin'
Goin on and on, who would stop at my mission?
Murder Robin Hood, fuckin' choke him with my belt
Then I steal from the rich and keep it for myself

[Hook]

Get High High High
Get High High High
Get High High High
Get High Get High



Read Chris Webby's Explanation "Webby's Lab 2 (Intro)"
[Verse 1]
Yeah...
I was, stuck inside my fuckin' studio pacing
Stressin' and second guessin' with all the music I'm makin'
Re assessin' who I choose to put faith in
And re-examinin' who really has a say in all these moves that I'm makin'
Stepped away for a minute, made a new situation
And now it's back to the basics, I know you have been waitin'
Cause see it ain't about the numbers or the views or rotations
I'm hungry, those in my way should get to funeral arrangin'
I'll bruise em, I'll scrape em, I'll chew em, I'll break em
And get a skewer, filet em, like food on my plate
And throw what's left in the stew I was makin'
I'm patient, I'm calm, and I'm cool, I'm just sayin'
The person that you see when you Google my name
With those stupid photo shoots from like 2008
With the early interviews of me sayin'
Some super outdated chemically fueled ludicrous statements
Was just a kid who lacked guidance, up in the public eye
But I'm all grown up now, so fuck it right?
Let's get back to raisin' hell up again
And talkin' shit about these rappers cause I'm better than them
Time to give 'em all a show, so go assemble your friends
We in the lab like it's 2011 again
The hands on the clocks jumpin', but dammit I'm not bluffin'
It's time to make shit get outta hand like I dropped somethin'
Won't stop nothing I'm back bitch, the bandicoot of DatPiff
With my lab kit, and bottle ready to crash shit

[Interlude]
Oh you think that's it?
Not even close motherfucker
Check

[Verse 2]
Rockin' crowds is what I love to do
Adrenaline is pumpin' through
My body, sending dopamine levels right through the fuckin' roof
Serotonin rushin' too, more than any drug could do
Music's like my antidepressant, this shit ain't nothing new
Without it I'd be caught up in stress, an alcoholic, a mess
I don't just do this cause it offers a check
Cause I don't need a label office, a jet, or a crib in the hills
Or a Lamborghini and jewelry all on my neck
But I'm sick of fallin' in debt with this Indian guy from American Express puttin' in this call to collect
But I see being pushed to the brink as a test
And honestly, bein' broke really seems to bring out my best
I feel like, I'm locked inside a fuckin' cage with a pen
Bein' pushed to the point that I hate this game that I'm in
Surrounded by these people who just like to fake and pretend
So they ask, "if that's the case why you ain't famous as them?"
I dunno, but just lemme give my midnight toast
Hip-hop's dead like Nas said and it's this I quote
I'm feelin' like I'm out the loop and it's an inside joke
"Wait wait, you're actually serious? You think this guy's dope?"
So I'll keep givin' my lectures, professor Webster is back
In my mask, jacket, and gloves, cookin' tracks in the desert
I'm back and I'm better, actin' erratic, dramatic, and clever
Cause I'm, still up in the fuckin' lab like Dexter

[Outro]
Five years later, we back up in the laboratory motherfucker!
Welcome to the mixtape
Ya!



Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Get your boarding passes ready
I'm about to take you to a place you ain't ever been before
Where insanity is the norm and you can party all damn day
Follow me, hahaha!
Step into my world

[Hook]
Come, come with me
I got anything you need, just follow my lead
You won't believe what you see, it's insanity
So just step into my world
I'd like to welcome you to Webby's World
Come, follow my steps
And you won't be ready for whatever's coming up next
We got music, drugs, and sex, come join on my quest
So just step in on my world
I'd like to welcome you to Webby's World

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Come and drift in space, bring you to a different place
Where it is crazy, everybody here got explicit taste
Every girl is beautiful and I could fuck all of em
Cause it's Webby's World, what else are they gonna call it son?
No one's locked up cause everybody's good people
No one stops the partyin' cause every drug is legal
We puff blunts fatter than a sumo
Till we gettin' lifted like the roof, higher than Pluto
Cause Webby's World is deep within a parallel dimension
So follow me if you begin to lose your sense of direction
Webby's World is hard to find unless you know the address
And only I know it, so forget searchin' on MapQuest
This is madness I need my prescriptions
Before I start flippin', a Vicodin should fix him
You could try to understand what I envision
But ain't nobody enterin’ into the mind of Christian

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I live in the future, so you are history
I'm so original that nobody could mimic me
Dope front to back, kill it with the symmetry
Like a drunk driver, I stay hittin' trees
Touch down on the surface of my planet
Disable tractor beams, cruisin' steady as I land it
A martian like Weezy, homie I'm just tellin' facts
We're both hunted by the mothafuckin' Men in Black
So come adventure with the Mutant Ninja Rapper
Outdo Shredder cause I learned it from my master
Splinter taught me how to kill it with all of my adverbs
Now my word play is enough to knock you backwards
Pop a pill and step into reality
Start seein' like me, fuck gravity
Follow me, I hope you're ready girl
I'mma bring you up to Webby's World

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Once you step into my world you’ll never leave
Now jump into the world of make believe
Tricks up my sleeve, now get lifted
To a place where reality is twisted
Nothing's what it seems and everything is opposite
I will take the lead and baby you should follow it
Cause where I'm goin', you need to come
Time to blast off now, 3, 2, 1
Like

[Hook]



[Intro]
You know, I just be fucking killing beats, ya know?
Killing beats, man
That's what I do, yessir

[Verse 1]
Giving your adrenaline a rush
Yo, it's Webby, listen up
Italiano on the mic, eating spaghetti in a cup
When I bust, can't label it
Crazy sick and I'm dangerous
Pesci up in a scorsese flip
I'm never taking shit
Take a rip from the Dutchie and pass it to the left
Chiropractor on the beat, I get it cracking like your neck
Swagger of a vet, keep these characters in check
Like Japan's nuclear reactors, I'm a threat
To the entire Northern Hemisphere
Lettin' em know that Webby's here
Chugging Belvedere, then I follow it with Everclear
Got them like "My God" them beating me
That shit don't make sense like Helen Keller with an iPod
Top mafioso, drinking a Four Loko
Hit them with that dope flow, bullet time, slow mo
Born in ochenta y ocho, Han Solo
Always chasing pussy like a dog, call me Toto
Fuckers better feel the flow, ain't no big pussies in my team
Just a Paulie and a Silvio, kill it though
Here we go, flowing it sick, boning your chick
I'm the 23 year-old Al Capone in this shit
Holding the chips, rolling up over a sip
Even people on the needles aren't doper than this
They formerly know me as Chris, now I'm transforming

[Hook]
Beat serial killer, Webster Morgan
Not a blood spatter analysis, just the type to strike fear
Giving all these punk rappers paralysis
And they mad at this because I'm finally getting big
And I no longer need a dollar like I did
Since I was a kid, I knew I had a purpose on this planet
So I always played the hand I was dealt, somethin' like Gambit
'Til I ran shit, all in with my damn chips
Got 'em scared to ante up, they folding like a pamphlet

[Verse 2]
Slicker than a Slip 'n Slide, leaving crowds mystified
Janitor at a rodeo, push that bullshit aside
This is why Webby be colossal with the flow
The next generation of Sopranos with the flow
Run shit, Lucky Luciano with the flow
Not taking a math test but I'm a problem and you know
I'm a pro, with the rhythm and I'm always gonna rock it, man
Labels fighting over me like Elían Gonzalez, fam
This is what I do, spit raps and blow trees
In the 203 with your girl on both knees
So who you think you're trying, kid?
Got the heart of a lion beneath some iron ribs
Rolling deeper than a Giant squid
Do it big, shootouts at high noon
Beat killer, the fucking Ted Bundy of iTunes
When an instrumental's looking right, I go and get the butcher knife
And cut it up until I need a hook to write
Went from a '98 Altima and got a tinted black Camaro
Always sipping bottles of rum like Jack Sparrow
Young Rob DeNiro who charges like a pharaoh
More deadly than a Legolas with a loaded quiver of arrows
Bowser's back up in this bitch, the bad guy
So when I steal your princess, you don't gotta ask why
I'm a beast and I show it through everything I'm recording

[Hook]

[Outro]
And that's it, ya know?
I just be, uhh, fucking killing beats
It's what I do, it's my M.O
Ya know, it's-
I don't know how to do anything else so fuck it
Heh! Webster! Yeahh

[Intro]
Welcome, welcome!
I'd like to welcome you all to Webster's Laboratory
I'll be your host for the evening
Chris Webby if you didn't already know
Step right in, let me show you around real quick
Heh, let's cook some shit up

Yeah!

[Verse 1]
It's that verbal visionary, criminally literary
Spit it clever, bitch it's Webster
You could check me on the dictionary
Under author credits
I'm the author, get it?
Mind sharper than a cutlass that I'll saw your head with
So authentic Donald Trump is my apprentice
Shaved his fucking comb-over off his head and made my exit
They can't see me, cause me see dyslexic
Cooking acid tabs into my omelet during breakfast
Three moves in Tetris? Nah, but I got a triple stack
I'm talking E pills 'til I can't remember jack, shit
Rolling with aliens like Men in Black
Repping for Connecticut, run and tell Kemba that
I'm a dirty dog, down to fuck your lady raw
Roll a J of Sour D, get twisted like a crazy straw
I'm a motherfucking beast off the leash
Until the obituary say that Webby is deceased
Killin' beats, call a priest
They can't censor me, cause if they try, the whole fucking song'll be a bleep
I'm a chief like Squanto, skin tone blanco
Balling on these bitches with better stats than Rondo
Rolling up cilantro, rolling in a Bronco
Running people over like it's Grand Theft Auto
CT to Cabo, I'm killing them with hot flow
Getting paid and spending more money than the lotto, easy

[Interlude]
So you see, here in Webby's lab
I'm gonna be hitting you with a lot of samples
Some industry beats
All cooked together with a nice topping of dope lyrics
Oh yeah and it's free, courtesy of Datpiff
And myself of course
The album is coming soon, so buy that
But until then, enjoy

[Verse 2]
Yeah! It's that wacky highly underrated rapping Caucasian
I'm not in it for the fame and the money, but shit I'll take 'em
I've been waiting here patiently while others got big
Now I'm like "Pick me coach, I'll slaughter these kids!"
I'm so hungry you can hear my fucking stomach through my ribs
Calling dibs on a title, let me show them what it is
I'm wrecking tracks, doing shows, and getting cash, huh
I'm triple x, way too big for any freshman class
It's in my repertoire, every single bar is hard
Spitting fire like I'm the human version of Charizard
A Super Smash Brother, make that money stack brother
Stick my dick in instrumentals 'til I'm on my last rubber
Motherfucker, what? Long as I can bust a nut
All over a track and then I'm bouncing with a couple sluts
Not to be derogatory, but you need to drop it shorty
Take them panties off, I'm in that ass like a suppository
Pop a 40 and chug
Until I'm puking all over the rug
Never sober, rolling the bud
Master of the multi-syllable raps
No one's iller in fact
With a precision Reggie Miller would back, huh
I'm just a Looney Toon, way more rude than you
And if you don't like what I'm doing, sue me dude
I haven't ever and I'll never give an f-word
Cooking shit up in the lab like Dexter

[Outro]
So boys and girls
6 mixtapes deep and I still haven't lost my touch as you can see
You know, I just really want to say thank you
To everyone that's supported me thus far
I feel like it's really time to take this shit over
Ninja Swag, bitches!
So again, welcome to Webster's Laboratory
And have a lovely fucking day, yeah!



[Verse]
I am not Simba, I am Mufasa
Roar so loud that it shakes the casa
Blowing more lines than Vinnie Chase and Sasha, Grey
A lot to say with penne a-la vodka
Woof, woof, I'mma play to eat it, then I
Woof, woof, spit like a bulimic
Raw bile on a track, but you better believe it
Webby half robot, call me General Grievous
Trying' to be a millionaire, stepping to Regis
Killin’ competitors I’ll leave your skeleton deep six
Go too hard you can tell when the beat hits
Write a whole page while you pencil a prefix
Woof, woof, no jokin’ homie
(Cough) I gotta quit smoking bogies
Real hip hop, never quote the phonies
USDA check what you wrote’s baloney
Spaz on the track and show ‘em what I’ma do
I’m a certified dude from my fitted to my shoes
Makin’ kissy faces at bitches like Pepe Le Pew
Tryina get ‘em from the bar to my fuckin’ bedroom
Asshole rap I’m a douchebag still
Drinkin’ like a pirate Bootstrap Bill
Brain fucked up on these two fat pills
If I don’t got ‘em I know a dude that will
I’m nice, and I will never lose that skill
Spit truth, you never head a dude that real
When I woof woof like a fuckin’ dragon
Make love to a beat need a bunch of Magnums
Step to the rappin’ call it a stand off
These Frodo Baggins ain’t fuckin’ with Gandalf
Pitbull rap, I’ma bite your hand off
She was your girlfriend now she takin’ her pants off
Uh, uh, then I stuck it in her
So damn hard that she’s fuckin’ injured
Skin tone white like I’m stuck in winter
Body covered in ink like I fucked a printer
Ya better step go find a stairwell
Turbulence incoming hittin’ an air swell
Tell my haters farewell, cause them beating me?
That’s like seein’ Pauly D without hair gel
Stay up in the booth like Snooki when she’s tanning
Fuck J Woww right here where I’m standing
Guidos getting famous when I’m on the grind and makin’ hits
I lift my shirt and show ‘em what the situation is
Uh, Let me take it down a notch
For real, I think a blood vessel just popped
Uh, but I’ma do it ‘til my heart stops
Load a sniper rifle baby take your best shot
Rah, I spit cold as sub-zero
I’m Hendrix, ya’ll just playing Guitar Hero
Who else is givin’ you this many free tapes?
No one
I’m on a roll like a Philly Cheese Steak, ha
Ease off the flow, it’s too dope
Every single quote is going right at your throat
Every single musical note that I wrote
Will have you bobbin your head until your neck broke
I’m the most, underrated dude up in the circuit
But I’d rather be that than overrated final verdict
Cause I’m nice, I say it all the time so I know you heard it
In my personal opinion, I’m perfect
Ha, now who fuckin’ with Webby?
Bubble in the answer if you wanna test me
Get buns every day of the week so let’s see
All I gotta do is send ‘em a poke on FB
It’s me
Another animal up out the cage
Grapple a beat like I was Diamond Dallas Page
Hey! Connecticut’s finally in play
So press the start button and watch me wreak may-
Hem on any motherfucker in my way
Just another Jabbawocky to slay, mayday
I got a lyrical resume and it states
Uh shit, I forgot, I’ve been high for days
I climb the stage
Jump out, crazy as hell
Rep New England like Tom Brady himself
Take a little Weird Al and some Shady as well
Get brains, you should see the way my cranium swells
Oh my god, is he openly talkin’ about fellatio?
What, you think I came here to talk you fuckin’ crazy ho?
Hit your knees, open your mouth, and we can take it slow
Meanin’ you should leave, sorry babe that’s just the way it go
Oh, I’m really running out of breath
I’m like 4 bars away from death
So I’ll give you 2 more just to show you how dope I can rap
And since you prolly missed half the lines I said run it back
Ha, Like I said run it back
Uh, uh, Like I said run it back
Uh, uh, Like I said run it back



[Intro] Chris Webby & Miss Daja
Hey Ms. Daja... alotta people been tellin me I'm a weirdo
Really?... I get that alot too, I don't understand why
Well let's get weird on em then huh?
Ohhh less go

[Verse 1] Miss Daja
I like dancing in the dark
Drink when I'm drving my car
Spend all my money on clothes
Am I a weirdo?

Wear make up to go to bed
But I only sleep naked
Say anything in my head
Am I a weirdo?

I like to think of myself, as cool
But you gon' say wrong
Cause I'm not you
Put my hands up do you hang loose?
But you gon' say I'm wrong
Call me a weirdo

[Hook] Miss Daja
Oh oh oh oh weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo oh

[Verse 2] Chris Webby
Ay yo wheres my adderall?
You see I'm weird it don't matter to me
Not being like you is what I happen to be
When I go I'm rappin a beat, I'm blazin shit
Because webby gets weird al yancovich

Uh all my sanity is stepped away
I wear ninja turtle tshirts everyday
I got cartoons tatted all over my whole body
Am I a weirdo... (duh) prolly

I got two pet turtles and a frog
A gravity bong and a fluffy white dog
Living in the attic in my parents house
I get drunk watching nickelodian on the couch

Transform running when I hear the beat
Even if strange is what I appear to be
I give true to myself and it's clear to see
That if your not a weirdo, then your weird to me

[Hook] Miss Daja
Oh oh oh oh weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo oh

Oh oh oh oh weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo

[Verse 3] Chris Webby
I'm weird, bizarre, strange and different
All my weirdos stay and listen
Fittin in, I'm just not with it
Am who I am, and I love it live it
W-e-I-to the r-d
Am I normal? hardly
Nerdy, loser, stoner, artsy
Let's show em' weirdos are the life of the party

And I'm back to spit
Saying that I'm not normal is accurate
But I be normal to me, so just shut your lips
And if you don't like my style, suck my dick

I walk around in boxers half the day
I am a bum, who would care what I have to say
But they still press play
So you know what?
If you not a weirdo, you better step your game up WHAT?

[Hook] Miss Daja
Oh oh oh oh weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo oh

Oh oh oh oh weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Ever since I came into the world back in '88
Had anxious brain waves with a baby face
Up in my crib I just laid awake, 'fore I could say my shapes
I was immersed in this crazy place
And uh, me and normal ain't compatible
I am from another universe so come and tag along
Yeah, I wasn't like the other kids up in my class at all
Doctor sayin', "Somethings wrong with him, give him Adderall"
Save me, this shit done made me crazy
Had ADHD and a case of rabies
Shit, I kept my grades up but my brain was spacey
Had to chase me, my legs never stayed in place see
I couldn't pay attention to what's in front of my face
Always in detention for something I shouldn't say
But hey, my mom said that I should speak my mind
And in time, intertwine, with this gift of rhyme
And as fate would have it
I just chased the rabbit down the hole, don't know if I'll make it back
I cheers with the Mad Hatter and blaze with Alice
Practicing black magic and taking acid
With the Cheshire Cat sitting shotgun
Maybe Goose to my Top Gun, wildin out until the cops come
Weirdo til I drop son, normal human I am not one
Yeah

[Chorus: Justina Valentine]
I don't give a damn what people say about me
(Baby can't you tell)
All of the jokes that the cool kids used to make about me
(Go fuck yourself!)
And I don't care if they are staring at me
Pretty soon they'll follow everywhere that I be, that I be
And I mean, I'm just a weirdo, yes, it appears so
Don't follow the leader, it's not my demeanor
That's not what I'm here for
'Cause I'm just a weirdo, isn't it clear though
I’m on my own planet and damn it
Don't care if you don't understand it

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Yeah, what's the difference between me and you?
Shit, I don't think like other people do
Shining like a holographic Pikachu
They said I'd never see it through
But now they got they face in they palm like playing Peek-a-Boo
Unbelievable, inconceivable, they not
I be seein' through, what they feedin' you, brainwash
'Cause an adolescent who's bad at lessons and not accepted
(Find another seat loser) Alrighty guys, I got the message
A little passive but aggressive in the same sense
Then found my passion and rapping ain't been the same since
1/8 lit in my space ship when I day trip
Put the joint to the flame tip
Said I'm hard to ignore, people tell me I'm a lot to absorb
I come around and all the normal people locking they doors
But ever since I was a board and grill mopping them floors
I knew one day they'd see me on the top of the Forbes

[Chorus: Justina Valentine]
I don't give a damn what people say about me
(Baby can't you tell)
All of the jokes that the cool kids used to make about me
(Go fuck yourself!)
And I don't care if they are staring at me
Pretty soon they'll follow everywhere that I be, that I be
I mean I'm just a weirdo, yes, it appears so
Don't follow the leader, it's not my demeanor
That's not what I'm here for
'Cause I'm just a weirdo, isn't it clear though
I’m on my own planet and damn it
Don't care if you don't understand it

[Bridge: Justina Valentine]
I don't care, they don't understand it
This my world, forget the whole planet
Follow me now, follow me now
And I don't care, you don't understand it
This my world, forget the whole planet
Follow me now, follow me now

[Chorus: Justina Valentine]
I don't give a damn what people say about me
(Baby can't you tell)
All of the jokes that the cool kids used to make about me
(Go fuck yourself!)
And I don't care if they are staring at me
Pretty soon they'll follow everywhere that I be, that I be
I mean I'm just a weirdo, yes, it appears so
Don't follow the leader, it's not my demeanor
That's not what I'm here for
'Cause I'm just a weirdo, isn't it clear though
I’m on my own planet and damn it
Don't care if you don't understand it



[Intro]
Yeah, the planet's fucked up man
Human beings are the worst thing that happened
To this whole Mother Earth baby
This is what it is, uh

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
The world we're livin' in, this shit is messed up
Sometimes it feels like God packed up and left us
Terrorist killin' people for no reason
The good die young, while evil's still breathin'
I can't even turn the news on
All you hear about is dangerous people creatin' new bombs
Serial killers and natural disasters
I'm just prayin' they'll be some pieces to put together after
Oil spills after Hurricane Katrina
Kim Jong-il sendin' threats from North Korea
The middle east, war on the streets
People strappin' bombs cause of their religious beliefs
Killin' others by the dozen
As the human race falls victim to our own self destruction
We gotta change the way we live
Cause it's the same fucked up world that I'll be leavin' to my kids
Man

How the fuck am I supposed to raise a family here, man?
How can I leave what we got, give it to my kids like... crazy
Sometimes it's nothin' but bad people
Nothin' but bad things goin' on, ah?
Fuck... What can I do, you know? What can I do?

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
We gotta make a change, it's our duty
We're rapin' the planet of it's resources and beauty
Gangs kill each other on American soil
While we destroy entire ecosystems drillin' for oil
I know times change, and shit evolves
But I remember forests and now the mini malls
Mother Earth been givin' us a warnin'
What happens when the ice caps melt from global warmin'?
Some of the most majestic creatures on this planet
Are hunted till the point the population's nearly vanished
Gunned down for recreational activity
And now can only be found at zoos and captivity
We've just become too technologically advanced
At this rate, the earth never stood a chance
The Mayans say our time is almost done
So if 2012 is true I guess we had a good run
Right?

Yeah, 2012 man it's comin'
Whatever your opinion is, we fucked
We got oil spillin' on the Gulf Coast
Deforestation in South America man, read about it man, fuck

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I'm not tryin' to seem to pessimistic
But if things don't change that outcome is realistic
And everyone should be aware of all this shit
As the world spins on it's axis like a kick flip
They say I poorly influence all of these kids
Cause honestly they shouldn't idolize the crazy way I live
But I don't want 'em makin' the same mistakes I did
That will lead 'em to a life full of nothin' but shit
Cause it's not cool to pop mad pills and act crazy
But I got my own demons, my own Slim Shady
That alter ego always up to nothin' but trouble
But I left all that behind me when I stepped out of the rubble
And try to get my life together followin' this rap shit
When I say it's all I got, I mean it, that's it
It's the way nobody stoppin' me from makin' it
And if it's not given to me, then I'm takin' it

I'm here baby, you know
I'm always on my party shit, La la la, Off The Chain
Whatever man,I'm an intelligent person, I know what's good
Go out, read the newspaper, see what's goin' on around you man
People too stupid, educate yourselves



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Stay chuggin' on the 40 ounce, brain cells fried
Like a clam strip, all day get high
Neverending Story, Falcor stay fly
Mom's a math teacher, so I gotta multiply
Not a mathematician myself so I ride, In my 98 Altima parked outside
Hustlin' mixtapes, I’m tryna get by, double U E double B follow with a Y
Motha fucka that’s me and I be so cool
To be on my level your gonna need a step stool
Always been a troublemaker gotta break rules
Breakin' every law until they kick me out of school
So amped up, you think I’m chuggin jet fuel
Chasin' a bottle of moon shine with an O'Doules
Since O'Doyle rules, let me pull a Billy Madison
And have em slippin' on banana peels if they challenge him
I"m bafflin' any competitor with what I'm rappin' and
The futures lookin' bright I think I’m starin' at a halogen
Born in '88, I got it tatted on my abdomen
Product of the 90s, everyday practicin'
Then it started happenin, turned into a beast
Full bred pit with a little Maltese
Woof, slaughter any track I see
Youve now been warned, you’d better hide your beats

[Hook]
I'mma never give a fuck about you
I’m just doing what I do
Murder any beat I put my mind too
Thought you knew that’s what I do
Rappin on the mike till my face turns blue
Through and through that’s what I do
That’s what I do

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Stop sleepin' over there, man pass the blunt
L ride around town and be back for lunch
Got a full plate of beats and some Captain Crunch
Mean on the mic, only lost a battle once
Everybody else, murked em, cooked it up, served em
Pen in hand, I got the dexterity of a surgeon
Freestyles burn em, written rhymes flawless
Like the names of every Mutant Ninja Turtle, I'm an artist
Bitch, nobody stoppin' what I’m sayin'
Lyrical display gone shock em like Raiden
Everyday ragin', show me where the party’s at
Where the bitches where the broads where the hotties at?
Where the liquor where the bud, where the Molly at?
Where the stage? I'm bouta give the crowd a heart attack
Life’s short so you know I gotta live it up
Brim low, dutch rolled, I’ma never give a fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
All I got's my word and my balls just a nerd with a cause
Livin' life like a video game, so press pause
Double tap X with a shot to the brain
Backback square, catch em' with the scorpion chain
So get over here bitch, I'll kick em' like Liu Kang
And fatality anybody who shits on my name
It's that tatted up tyrant, heatin' up the climate
Pissin' on these haters like puppies on fire hydrants
It's that motherfuckin' Optimus Rhyme
Full bottle of pills, blunted, with a bottle of wine
Fully transform bout to take over the game soon
Ain't’ no mothafucka I’m afraid to bring the flame to
Got em rotisserie while I be smokin' piffery
Makin' words connect like letters written in calligraphy
Not a person here steppin' in my shoes
Cause C. Webby's back, and this is what I do

(Hook)



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I love women, from Britney Spears to Marge Simpson
Just give me a rubber and you know that I'm goin' in son
Ain't no tee ball, but it's still easy to hit them
Cause I know what women want, call me Mel Gibson
Yes, cause they know we on next
They can throw me on set, watch em' go beyond sex
I ball hard but not in the Kobe context
I'm collectin' v-cards like a Pokemon deck
Muthafucka, cause I'mma speed to the top
Downin' a leader of scotch, cause like a demon I'm hot
White as a laundry load full of wife beaters and socks
Not even Ripley's is sure if they can believe it or not
Watch, I'll make 'em come to a dead stop
Cause on a beat, I'mma spit it hard as a pet rock
Baby girl, you know I'll make that bed hot
I'm no angel, my only Halo came with an Xbox
Drink till I"m walkin' like a waddlin' duck
But I can step a straight line just to follow a buck
I'm just looking for a chicken who can swallow a nut
Like a pecan pie in front of Jabba The Hutt
Wait what? and there is no way she could ignore me
Grabbin' on my Woody like Andy from Toy Story
With them lips like Topanga, I'll play the role of Cory
And sit back and watch you do your thing there shorty
Cause you know you can not start me
12 beers deep and I'm the life of the party
Bring a chick back and you know we gettin' naughty
Bite her so hard she be like "ouch Charlie!"
Cause you know we gets busy
Heads spinnin' like Taz so you know we get dizzy
Datpiff top 8 with Banks, Luda, and Drizzy
Sick as the swine flu, I been fuckin' Ms. Piggy
Really get silly, bitch you know this dude's nice
Mommy's comin' over and she's spendin' a few nights
Lyrics like an emo kid's pants, man too tight
Throwin' mad punches just like pudding in a food fight
Ha, so I'mma hit 'em with more bars
Cause I'm always needing me some M to the O-R
E mothafucka and you know that I go hard
I'm at the top of my game, I'll send you a post card
Bitch!



[Produced by Sap]

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
When I get up in the booth, Sap play those beats
Yeah the white boy slick, but I stay low-key
Smart kid, brain sharper than a Mako's teeth
I like my chicks a little dirty and my Jamo neat
Like a woman who don’t got a whole lot to say
With a booty more than half her whole body weight
And when you lookin’ like that, I just gotta taste
So I just put ‘em on a plate like I’m Bobby Flay
Maneuvering, when we doin’ things
Get up in her till I rearrange her NuvaRing
Oh shit, why you even steppin’ to a king?
I’m a vet, you could use a little tutoring
Let me break it down, and you could watch as I do
Make her shut the fuck up, I’ma Papa Doc you
Stayin’ up all night like I’m Nosferatu
All I know is how to kill it and I probably got to, what?

[Bridge: Stacey Michelle]
I need a drag of that Jameson
‘Cause I got the taste you’ve been savoring
Ooh, ah, I got exactly whatchu need
Said ooh ah, I got exactly whatchu need

[Hook: Stacey Michelle] (x4)
(I got whatchu need)
I got whatchu need, I got whatchu need

[Verse 2: Sap]
I’m outworkin’ y’all, yeah I said that
Sonnin’ niggas to get on they job like Craig dad
Hoes tryin’ to figure where my head at
I told them mind they business, shorty show me where your bed at
Knock ‘em off quick and I’m back to it
You ain’t talkin’ ‘bout no paper, then I probably turn my back to it
Drop my new shit, watch ‘em snap to it
Said it couldn’t be done, well nigga watch Sap do it
Man you know I stay on track, you can’t hate on that
Cop a foreign, put the American plate on that
She got a ass shot appointment, can’t wait on that
If you want it fatter, I could push some weight on that
I’m that nigga, ho, and I know you heard
Ask around in your town, you don’t really run this shit
Said you need a track from me, what’s the word?
You gon’ need ten racks if you really want a hit, I’m the shit

[Bridge: Stacey Michelle]
I need a drag of that Jameson
‘Cause I got the taste you’ve been savoring
Ooh, ah, I got exactly whatchu need
Said ooh ah, I got exactly whatchu need

[Hook: Stacey Michelle] (x4)
(I got whatchu need)
I got whatchu need, I got whatchu need

[Outro: Stacey Michelle]
I got whatchu need, I got whatchu need
I got whatchu need, I got whatchu need
I got whatchu need, I got whatchu need
I got whatchu need, I got whatchu need
(I got whatchu need)
(I got whatchu need)
(I got whatchu need)
(I got whatchu need)



[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Webby back up in this bitch, running at the fucking lip
Proud to be American? Huh, yo fuck the government
The president ain't doing shit
And everybody knows, a fucking country is controlled by corporations, CEO's
Tell me how they locking people up for 20 bags of 'dro
The people making laws the biggest criminals on the globe
Feeling is different now that I'm old enough to see right through the media
And search to find the truth through all the bullshit that they feeding us
Kids today are learning what they know from Wikipedia
And take whatever pills the fucking doctor says you need in ya
Generation RX, now I'm fucking dependent
On attention medications cause I've been on em since I was seven
Now we need Adderall to wake up, an Ambien to sleep
Vicodin to ease the pain and steroids if you're feeling weak
And everybody on the street is on their phones like they don't give a damn
And kids are learning social skills from Facebook and Instagram
So I light up a doobie and exhale, blowin smoke up in the sky
While I'm looking at chemtrails
With grimy politicians and twisted Mayan predictions
I'm like fuck it, let me just enjoy my time while I'm living
The shit is got me saying

[Hook]
I don’t give a fuck if you don’t like me
You’ll never find another motherfucker like me
Somebody stepping to the kid is unlikely, so bite me
I do whatever I like, with these words that I write
Soon as I pick up a mic, I do whatever I like
Bitch I do whatever I like

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
I'm so fly my attitude has take me to a cruising altitude
Of a view that will show you how a falcon moves
I got no rules I'm not prohibited or limited
Excuse me if I'm offending you, suck my dick my people is feelin it
Feminine feelings about my opinions just let me know that I'll be scarier
Free style equal free speech; I thought this was America
America, home of the free, land of the brave
I'm at home on the stage, I fuck your head up
Like trying to run a comb through the braids
A dog in the rap game and still ain't got no bone thrown in my cage
A fucking immature juvenile, only thing wrong is my age
And you won’t sit you’ll see sick like the boat rocking on waves
And honestly I gotta be a paranoid
Cause I watch my iPhone but I feel like my iPhone is watching me
I'm in a whirl-wind, I wonder where the world went
Cause that motherfucker can help you find me faster than my girl can
And this world is fucking up, this world is fucking us
Technology fucked us up, and Siri you're a fucking slut
The way this world turning is beyond me
Between the economy, astrology, and bath salt zombies, I'm like

[Hook]



[Intro]
Gather 'round everyone
I have something to tell you about a wondrous place
Over the hill, across the river, into the dark woods
Where the wild things are
But be careful
There are things waiting for you in the woods
Wild things, there are wild things

[Verse 1]
Have you seen us, we the wild things boy
With a squad so big fill arenas, that's where you can find me boy
Got a, battery up on my back like a Mophie
Spider web emoji up on the trophy, rocking all black like Shinobi
Weed up in the pouch like a joey, I'm Wile E. Coyote with
Kylie and Khloe and Miley and Zoe Saldana, Natasha Leggaro
Madonna, Kalani and Josie, the Pussycats too
In my Honda we rolling be gone till the morning
I follow my calling and swallow my fear
But the doctor been sayin' I lost it, it's clear
That I just cannot gauge it to small of an ear
But these voices are calling that's all I can hear
I am, out here where the wild things be at, biatch
Hit 'em so quick can't react
Halloween Town with a crown like Jack
Fully psycho maniac, he that, shouter with a scream mask
He O.D. at, killer, ya'll better evac., shhh, quiet, hear that?
Over where the tree at? That's where you can find me at

[Pre-Chorus]
Just follow the way, come and follow the way
Don't stop on the road, just step farther away, step farther away
From all that you know, don't get caught in the fray
Or you could just call it a day, cause where we gon' go
Where the monsters will play, so all I can say

[Chorus]
Yeah baby you can find me
Where the wild things are (x3)
Yeah baby you can find me
Where the wild things are (x3)

[Verse 2]
I'm where the lions and tigers and bears go
Places that you wouldn't dare go
Blaze the trail without hesitation
Tell me why you waitin'—are you scared bro?
I'm not a sane man, strange man
More like rain man man (man man)
Roll haze till the stone age I'm a cave man man
Whippin' like Mad Max, loud packed in the packs till I cat nap
Then I go and snap back runnin' through the maze like a lab rat
Looking for the cheese let me have that
Maybe you can find me in the dark like a zombie
Calmly, chillin' at the bar with a blondie
Jager Bomin' tryna drown out my problems
But they be swimmin' like they Phelps in the water
I'm outta order with disorders prescribed
The orderlies ought to be checkin' my arms that they tied
They can not restrain me or try to explain to me
That this is all in my mind
Mister Babadook right out the comic book
I got em' shook and they got nowhere to hide
Stop and look around, watch it cause you now
All the way out in the wild

[Pre-Chorus]
Just follow the way, come and follow the way
Don't stop on the road, just step farther away, step farther away
From all that you know, don't get caught in the fray
Or you could just call it a day, cause where we gon' go
Where the monsters will play, so all I can say

[Chorus]
Yeah baby you can find me
Where the wild things are (x3)
Yeah baby you can find me
Where the wild things are (x3)



[Intro/Hook]
I've been here for a minute
While they judged I lived it
And I've proved I'm here to stay
Now they all gather in and listen till there's nothing left to give 'em
But I still got more to say
I had a struggle on my ride here
Caught up in the grind and I almost lost my way
But if I ever call it quits, all I know is this
It won't be today (it won't be today)

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm a survivor, I've waited my turn, now it's my time sir
Had to dig deep, pick axe, coal miner
I'm like Ghost Rider, blazing a trail and flow fire
Shit my razor sharp lyrics turn your fitted to a visor
That mix-tape supplier, pulsing through your speaker wires
With a dutchie and a lighter, stay higher than frequent fliers
My word game demolishing these halfway decent writers
They rubbing sticks together I'm your local heat provider
Swerving through the street dividers like its Large Marge whipping it
Music juiced up, get a car charge with this shit
Now they asking questions like they "Nardwuar" in this bitch
Still I keep it dirty like a barn yard when I spit
Bars hard ripping shit, murder and I bury beats
Always come to play, at the studio in a pair of cleats
A pterodactyl to these mother fucking parakeets
Take it to the top, even higher than my hand can reach

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Look... for some of y'all to relate
Ya I trap you in a box for a season
Bullets bobbing and weaving still they popping and squeezing
No law to abide by, still you watching for deeds and
What's worse, you can't think of any logical reason
Been learned, when the pass comes it might be a no look
In the trap they keep you, that's why I stayed in my notebook
The tougher you try to be the lesser I was impressed
And I wish the nigga would like I had his best interest
Arms like tree trunks, weight is relentless
Fuck the world I'm going ape on this bench press
Careful with my foot and though they trimmed off half the ledge
I'm along for your sake dawg, me and the fags don't mesh
'Bout that, you'll see how I react to threats
Hear the gun sing or meet the knife with the jagged edge
But shit ain't how it used to be
So let my foes know they gotta get used to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Me giving up? It won't happen today
Rap til the day that they fucking bury me, put me in a casket to lay
So while I'm here just listen up to what I happen to say
I'll show you history being made in elaborate ways
I'm still a fully independent juggernaut up in this shit B
Tryin' to make that capital, holding down my shift key
The undisputed Best in the Burbs is what I still be, so feel me
'Cuz fucking with the flow is more than risky
A dog built like a doberman-pit mix breed
You pussy cats coughing up hairballs like Stimpy
Me? I spit venom, now I'm reppin in the big leagues
A grizzly, laughing while you teddy bears diss me
Hehhh, so if they ain't digging the flow fuck 'em
Go Mighty Joe Young in the building with Joe Budden
Show I'm something with this music shit, out here doing it
We ain't going nowhere bitch so get used to it



(intro)
Yeah
I love you hip-hop
I really do
Yeah
Verse 1: Chris Webby
What's love?
I don't know yet
When I think back at every single
Blonde or brunette
A-a-and it's not that I don't like sex
But I fuck one girl
Then it's on to the next
But with hip-hop
It's something more
Can't tell if it's lust
Or it's love for sure
But uh, We've been seeing each other now for a minute
She made me the man that I am
Now I live it
A-a-and it's more than just music
She taught me to have no fear
And just do it
When I was locked up
She helped me get through it
She gave me a dream
And I swore to pursue it
She with me in the whip
And then I get home
And she's laying beside me
Reppin' the headphones
Fuck a girlfriend
Hip-hop's my only
With her and a stereo
I'll never be lonely
Yeah

Verse 2: Tim Gallo
She's acting like I lost a step
When, I haven't even started yet
And, these other broads and brunettes
She's playing hard to get
I'm sending compliments
Then, she's still far from yes
And got me coming back like a farm assist
My only hope is, this isn't all for sex
And if it is, I have to press pause for breath
And these other hoes can't get it up
That's cause
I like to bump beats when I fuck
So what?
If this chick is my savior
Even though she does that switch
And rotate her
But you've got to have patience
She's so much more than an acquaintance
And if you're looking for the same life style
Don't trust her
Cause she's being trained right now

Verse 3: Danimal Lector
It was 9-9-95, age ten
I basically spent my time alone
Only had like eight friends
Felt like no one understood me
Way back when
But then I met you
And I was like amen
We been together since
I was in a playpen
But you started acting different
And I saw you change then
You best switch it up
Bitch, what's up?
I love you
But you fuckin' this shit up
I'm pissed enough
Me and you went everywhere
Slept with my Walkman
Not a teddy bear
We were always together
Now you're never there
I know what they say
Life, it ain't ever fair
Hard not to shed a tear
Cause you're a piece of art
8-8-808 drum
That's the beat of my heart
I miss you
But believe me I'm smart
So no worries
The main stream ain't deep enough
To keep us apart



[Hook: Skrizzly Adams]
Hey, they're calling
They're calling my name
I got the whole world on fire
And I ain't going away
I been real through all this
Staring straight at the flame
I got the whole world on fire
And I ain't going away
I ain't going away

[Bridge: Chris Webby & Jon Connor]
Standing tall, head high, doing what I wanna do
If I fall, I get up, I done came too far to lose
Pushing through, pick it up, even when my body's tired
I got enough drive inside to set the fucking world on fire

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
What can you do for me now?
Used to the enemy shooting me down
But truthfully how
Can you try to stop me when truth can be found?
And knowing that life is a lesson
No question what you could be now
We let this aggression take over and over and over
A chip on our shoulder get bigger, ignore what they told us
I told you I was a soldier (yeah)
Never quit, don't fall
If I do, I apologize y'all
Might slip, won't trip
To be real, shit, I idolize y'all
Why? Cause if you hear me now
You ain't take the easy way out
You knew it was light at the end of the tunnel
When you couldn't see a way out
Faith is what you can't teach
Haters may say what you can't reach
As long as I stay playing these beats
At the end of my day, y'all I'm at peace
Peace of mind, I'mma just ease my mind
Relieved with the peace I find
And ease my rhymes, I need my time
Somebody out there might need these lines
Yep, I got you, ain't a choice no more, I got to
Ain't nobody's word's gone stop you
Don't cry homeboy that's not you
Look, when it ain't easy I know that
Been came too close can't go back
Your dream is yours, believe that
Yep, even when the world can't see that
I see that, that's real

[Hook: Skrizzly Adams]

[Bridge: Chris Webby & Jon Connor]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Told myself I got this shit (is this my time?)
Better hope to God it is
Losing my mind (show me a sign)
I’m no astrologist (but I just need to know)
Cause I really put everything I got in this
When all I had was empty bank accounts and broken promises
Life ain’t like the comics, ain’t no Superman to save the day
Ain’t no one to clear the road, it’s on you to pave the way
Get your dreams tatted up, never let em fade away
And toughen up that skin and disregard what all them haters say
Listen I been through all that too
What you think I ain’t been down on my luck?
I’m dealing with shit on the daily, it’s driving me crazy
But I ain’t about to give up
Keeping my family close so I can know everybody around me I trust
Now I got Earth right up in my hands
Get ready cause this shit about to combust, what?
I’m not lying when I'mma say
That the world could end tomorrow, set fire to it today
(Homegrown!)
Ay, we really ain't too different after all
Im tryna find my happy place and you're welcome to tag along

[Bridge: Skrizzly Adams]
I know what it’s like sometimes when you feel like it’s over
Cause everything that’s wrong goes right when it’s all for the fight
Handle yours like a soldier, and make em say…
I know what it’s like sometimes when you feel like it’s over
Cause everything that’s wrong goes right when it’s all for the fight
Give it up like I told ya, and make em say…

[Outro: Jon Connor]
I got, I got, I got the world on fire man
I got, I got, I got the world on fire man
I got, I got the world on fire!

[Hook]



[Intro]
Listen to me, learn from me
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly
I was the best because the crowd loved me
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom
I will win the crowd
I'll give them something they've never seen before

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Look, I ain't play games, homie, I ain't got time
Especially when I do this for my homies that done got time
Imma do this for the city, every hot line
Go to every block, every hood, every corner, every stop-sign
I just wanna get it for the days that I was living in the hood
Wait a minute, I don't even know if you can call it living
Pay attention, cause at any given minute
You be chilling with your niggas and be witness to a killing, hold up
Grew up on the north side, north side
Nigga to the fullest, I was quicker than a bullet
That was going past the window, it's all or nothing
So I'm coming for the crown, what the fuck you think I'm here for?
Make no mistake about it, fake shit I can't allow it
Trapped in this game, now I can't get out it
You want that real shit, and I feel the same about it
I was in the trenches just like you
Wondering how the fuck Imma get through
I don't have a plan, but I know one thing:
Gotta get up out of this motherfucker, and I can't lose
Eyes on the prize, and I know I can't quit
Never gonna fail, so I'm on my shit
Gotta keep going and I can't look back
Took on the world and now it's on my back, back
Back up, homie, don't act up
I'm from Fly City where this rap shit really ain't a factor
And when them killers on your back and make a
Motherfucking backpacker pack up
On some other shit, them was the odds I was up against
So I ain't phased by none of this
Cause in reality, I love that shit
For all the grinding I was doing, I ain't no one you was fucking with

[Bridge]
See, I've been on my hustle for a minute
Now it's really time to get it
So it's only fair I'm letting them know
That I'm a motherfucking animal, it's true
You don't want me coming for you
Just sit back and keep enjoying the show, cause yo

[Hook]
You don't really want it, nah
(Come and step to the floor, you already know
That I'm too cold with the microphone
I'm beastmode, better leave it alone)
You don't really want it, nah
(Cause I came too far to stop
Regardless I’m off the wall, chip off the block
I’m a monster, watch bitch, better call the cops)

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Welcome to the Hunger Games
You give up your whole life but get tons of fame
There's rappers who don't write but get companies
Making of with their souls for a chunk of change
I got more profits than those, y'all so dumb to chase
But they popped off all the time, but they a bum today
Man, I got that Glock that I tote make you cuff your chain
You see my pockets is gordo, you chubby chase?
I got a plot to take over this continent
While I'm over-thinking, all these bitches are there gossiping
So Imma take a spliff, take a hit, something monstrous
Cause I really quit but I think I've been locked in
And all this bullshit and I'm sick of the politics
I'm gonna show you which really bitch but it's obvious
All of these hoes really want to just party and molly
And violence and bottles and popping and dropping
And opposite, that is just me, are you taunting them?
All they admire us, not in that guapa shit
Alternately, I think I'm gonna stop the gig
Talk to them, all bitches wearing this God-given
Oculus urge of confidence
I'm just subconscious shit trying to make all y'all get y'all bitches
Hearing my shit but I'm not spitting anymore lessons
Bae, do what you wish, I ain't gon' stress
Man, you finna get little Miss Snow from oh wait where I spit
All about selling drugs and the things that I did
Cause I done sell 'tapes and I toured
And I ripped all these stages from East to the West
And these kids and these magazine covers just don't give a shit
What the fuck? You want Product? I'll give you a fix this is it

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
C-Webby be carnivorous, bars rippin', shit
I'm the boss, people be calling me Sarge in this bitch
Make a mess, gotta keep a fucking tarp and a whip
As I keep evolving, just like Darwin predicts
So it's off with his head and I'm off with his chick
Keep it calm till I flip, then I'm off in this bitch
Fuck Dawn of the Dead
Shit I got grown men hiding under their bed
Thinking that monster exist
Cooking up that east coast dough
With a pad and a pen and the words that I wrote
Every syllable invented that's enclosed and in quotes
Are too complex for most folk, but you know
I'm a ghost in the booth, can't see me though
Hard body with the flow, C3PO
Lost track of all the fucking Sour D we rolled
So high, Major Tom can’t reach me bro (Shh)
Yo it's Major Tom and, you don't really want it
So everyone can suck my dick without a condom on it
I'm just full of that chronic, gin no tonic
Couple capsules in my pocket
Know I'm gonna rock it, feeling so right
Going psychotic, they feeling my rhymes
Sipping Hpnotiq, and I'm losing my mind
Roll back another time cause I'm just a...
Motherfucker with the coldest flow
CT to the Poconos, you better hold the phone
Before you leave with a broken nose
I'm so dope that I think I'm 'bout to overdose
Now I'm feelin' like I'm really 'bout to go the road
That ain't chose by most men, so I go alone
Into the dark side
How could I have sold my soul?
I never had one, bitch! Motherfucker, let's go!

[Bridge]

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
You say he don't treat you right
You say it ain't the same
He spends all his time playing your heart like it's just a game
He should have never let you go
Now I got a real good reason
To let you know
I wanna hold you close
And pick up the pieces

[Chorus]
You don't have to be alone tonight
Why you sitting at home tonight
Waiting for him to call you up at midnight drunk?
To tell you that he wants you
Let's get out of town tonight
Get lost and found tonight
'Till you don't care
Let me love you right
Let's go somewhere where you and I can be all alone tonight

[Bridge 1]
I wanna see your face
And whisper in your ear
I'm gonna say all the little things you've been wanting to hear

[Chorus]
You don't have to be alone tonight
Why you sitting at home tonight
Waiting for him to call you up at midnight drunk?
To tell you that he wants you
Let's get out of town tonight
Get lost and found tonight
'Till you don't care
Let me love you right
Let's go somewhere where you and I can be all alone tonight, be all alone tonight

[Bridge 2]
You don't have to be alone tonight
I want you for my own tonight
Girl

[Chorus]
You don't have to be alone tonight
Why you sitting at home tonight
Waiting for him to call you up at midnight drunk?
To tell you that he wants you
Let's get out of town tonight
Get lost and found tonight
'Till you don't care
Let me love you right
Let's go somewhere where you and I can be all alone tonight, be all alone tonight



Everybody waitin' for the weekend
Gettin' off five in the P.M
Wanna blow off a little steam and
Go cut loose somewhere

Folks start showin' up at seven
Order up a crown or a cold one
Nobody buyin' rounds for no one
No girls dancin' on the bar in there

But in the A.M. they go from gettin' busted to wasted
Might not remember what they're sayin'
Radio turned up playin' loud a honkeytonk station
Spendin' what you spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
The whole world's asleep, but we're wide awake in the A.M

Leave around ten and you're alright
Everybody's cool, never uptight
But if you stay longer than midnight
You might end up in the middle of a fist fight

Cause in the A.M. they go from gettin' busted to wasted
Might not remember what they're sayin'
Radio turned up playin' loud a honkeytonk station
Spendin' what you spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
The whole world's asleep, but we're wide awake in the A.M

In the A.M. they go from gettin' busted to wasted
Might not remember what they're sayin'
Radio turned up playin' loud a honkeytonk station
Spendin' what you spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
Hey, baby, tell me whatcha think about
Gettin' out of this place and let me show you my Chevrolet
And we can sit and do a little star gazin'
Get a little bit of alone time in, in the A.M

Yeah, yeah in the A.M



Yeah, I think I’m gonna leave
I’ll just have that one drink
And we’ve all gotta be up early

Boys, we oughta shut’er down
Just take it to the house
‘Fore anybody starts getting crazy

I started walking across the floor
Before I got to the door

Aw Naw
Somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron
Hang on, I just might have to stay hey
Aw Naw
Look at the time y’all
What happend to coats on
Long gone
I should be half way home but
Aw Naw

Yeah
Girl I saw you come in
With all of your girlfriends
Just cutting up and shooting Bacardi
Yeah
I got my boys with me
We’re just rolling on steam
Not looking to pick up anybody

I was gonna walk on by
You turned around and we locked eyes

Aw Naw
Do you hear that song
Oh one that just came on
C’mon DJ what you tryin’ to do
Aw Naw
It’ll be so wrong
If we didn’t dance one
Show off, Those jeans you painted on
Aw Naw
Aw Naw

No I didn’t mean to be here this long
And I tried to leave so it ain’t my fault
No I didn’t mean to be holding you
But tell me what was I suppose to do

Aw Naw
Somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron
Hang on, We’ve been here all night long
Aw Naw
It’ll be so wrong
If we didn’t dance one more song
Show off, Those jeans you painted on
Yea Aw Naw
Those jeans you painted on
Aw Naw



Two dollars shy of a five dollar bill
Last mile I pushed my truck uphill
About hurt me
I left my truck by the pump right where I parked it
Walked through the doors of the Last Chance Market
Have mercy, I was thirsty
The guy behind the counter said what's it gonna be
I said I don't know man, you tell me

It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack
Makes life complicated when it costs the same
Hell it ain't no fun, to do without one
But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
It's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what I mean
It's either beer of gasoline

I could feel that video camera watch me
Checkin' out the sale on the ol' Milwaukee
(Mmm) Three bucks to my name
That cooler had every brand known to man
Tall boys, bottles, and aluminum cans
(Aww) What a shame
And it's gettin' pretty bad when you finally discover
It all comes down to either one or the other

It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack
Makes life complicated when it costs the same
Hell it ain't no fun, to do without one
But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
It's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what I mean
It's either beer of gasoline

I could see where this is headed
And I'm tired of talkin'
Cold beer unleaded
Hell I'm walkin'

It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack
Makes life complicated when it costs the same
Hell it ain't no fun, to do without one
But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
It's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what I mean
It's either beer of gasoline

Beer or gasoline

It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack

Now it ain't no fun to do without one
But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run



[Verse 1]
I won't lie, it hurts like hell
So I'm doin' shots, just tryin' to deal
But all this pain, she left me with
So I'm getting gone so I can get

[Chorus]
Blacked out
Like Elvis in 1968
Like Johnny Cash any given day
Like a Mach 1 Fastback Mustang
I'm blacked out like the clouds hanging over this heart of mine
These ray bans covering up my eyes
Not a shadow of a doubt, blacked out

[Verse 2]
Her goodbye rattles around
Just like a ghost in this house
That's why I drink, to drown it out
It's the only way I know to let her go for a little while

[Chorus]
Blacked out
Like Elvis in 1968
Like Johnny Cash any given day
Like a Mach 1 Fastback Mustang
I'm blacked out like the clouds hanging over this heart of mine
These ray bans covering up my eyes
Not a shadow of a doubt, blacked out

[Bridge]
Blacked out
Like that label on a bottle of jack
The old guitar Emmylou has
Like the coal at the bottom of an old mine shaft

[Partial Chorus]
Blacked out
Like the clouds hanging over this heart of mine
The ray bans covering up my eyes
Not a shadow of a doubt

[Outro]
No, there's not a shadow of a doubt
Blacked out
Blacked out



You take a wrong turn, drop a ball, fall short, you labor in vain
You choke, miss the boat, bomb out, cave in, fall flat on your face
Yeah that's everyday life
But sometimes...

You hit a good lick, the stars light up
Your ship comes in, you make your mark
You catch a break, and you're sittin' on top
Yeah, cream of the crop!
You're the stuff, you set the bar
You beat the odds and there you are
Spend most your life sittin' in the dark waitin' your turn
But every now and then you burn

You go wild in style, chest out chin up, you're king for a day
And then reality hits like a fist, hits you hard, steels your thunder away
And when it beats you down
The wheel spins around

You hit a good lick, the stars light up
Your ship comes in, you make your mark
You catch a break, and you're sittin' on top
Yeah, cream of the crop!
You're the stuff, you set the bar
You beat the odds and there you are
Spend most your life sittin' in the dark waitin' your turn
But every now and then you burn

You burn like a beacon
Burn like a porch light
Burn like a blue star
Burn like a bon fire
Burn like a flicker in a red hot flame
Burn like a match in a deep dark cave
Like a midnight mile-high blaze

You hit a good lick, the stars light up
Your ship comes in, you make your mark
You catch a break, and you're sittin' on top
Yeah, cream of the crop!
You're the stuff, you set the bar
You beat the odds and there you are
Spend most your life sittin' in the dark waitin' your turn
But every now and then you burn

Yeah you burn

Like a porch light
Like a blue fire



[Verse 1]
Like a desert calls the rain on the hottest, driest day
And when those storm clouds hit it comes alive
Like a guitar calls for strings, without 'em it can't sing
About that girl, she's my world, the one thing on my mind

[Chorus]
Is that riding down the road, her shotgun with me
Those come-to-bed eyes when she's had too many
The way she don't have to say a thing
She's callin' my name
That wink when her dress starts falling
The way she's gotten my heart wrapped up all in one look
She don't even say a thing
And she's callin' my name

[Bridge]
Like a jukebox calls for change so it can pick a love song to play
Just like last call calls for one more drink

[Chorus]
Is that riding down the road, her shotgun with me
Those come-to-bed eyes when she's had too many
The way she don't have to say a thing
She's callin' my name
That wink when her dress starts falling
The way she's gotten my heart wrapped up all in one look
She don't even say a thing
And she's callin' my name

[Verse 2]
Her kiss, her touch says please stay longer
Every day her love gets stronger
She's callin' my name
With every glance it just gets louder
I can't help but think about her
She's callin' my name

[Chorus]
Is that riding down the road, her shotgun with me
Those come-to-bed eyes when she's had too many
The way she don't have to say a thing
She's callin' my name
That wink when her dress starts falling
The way she's gotten my heart wrapped up all in one look
She don't even say a thing
And she's callin' my name

[Tag]
That girl is callin' my name



I'm pushing you away each time I pull up that ol' barstool
Drownin' you in every drop I drink
Telling you to go to hell but I'm talking to myself
'Cause you're not around to hear what I think

I'm trying to teach my heart to hate you but it ain't workin' right
Now the truth is I'm only
Drinkin' me lonely tonight

And Lord, it's more than just thirsty that I'm feeling inside
'Cause these tears I've been crying have left me bone dry
I wish the bartender had a cure I could buy
But the truth is I'm only
Drinkin' me lonely tonight

He said I'd have to choose between your love and this old bar room
I just laughed but I guess you knew best
Who cares who's right or wrong tonight, my better half is gone
And this whiskey's laying claim to all that's left

So I'll just order up another and pretend I'm all right
When the truth is I'm only
Drinkin' me lonely tonight

And Lord, it's more than just thirsty that I'm feeling inside
'Cause these tears I've been crying have left me bone dry
I wish the bartender had a cure I could buy
But the truth is I'm only
Drinkin' me lonely tonight

So I'll just order up another and pretend I'm all right
When the truth is I'm only
Drinkin' me lonely tonight



He said son hold it still
Keep that beam shining straight
He’d have a 9/16ths in one hand
Working on that Chevrolet
It seemed like every Saturday
Soon as the sun went down
We’d be huddled underneath that hood
Tinkering around
And of all of the great memories I’ve had
The best ones are those nights just me and my dad

He’ll never how much he taught me
Out in that garage
And I guess the stuff that stuck
Was more about life than fixing cars
Cause to this day I still can’t make them run right
But I sure did learn a lot
Just holding the flashlight

He told me a lot of stories
About Grandpa and the war
While he was trying to show me
What a carburator’s for
I learned a couple cuss words
When he skinned his knuckles up
And I found out Momma was the only girl
He ever really loved
Then I asked him about women, he just laughed
Said if we stayed out here all year
We wouldn’t have time enough for that

He’ll never how much he taught me
Out in that garage
And I guess the stuff that stuck
Was more about life than fixing cars
Cause to this day I still can’t make them run right
But I sure did learn a lot
Just holding the flashlight

And to this day I still can’t make them run right
But deep inside I know that it’s alright
Cause I sure learned a lot
Just holding the flashlight

Thanks Dad



I should have took you dancing
A little candlelight romancing, with roses
But I was high up on a barstool
Yeah, I was such a blind fool
Now I know it

You won't believe how much I've changed since you left
It took losing you for me to find myself
Oh I wish that you could see me
Steady hands without the whiskey
You'd be so proud

I got a job down at the factory
A brand new suit for Sunday
And I'm in church now
It's been one year since I sat behind a bar
I went by the junkyard
And they've still got our car

I still see you on your knees
Begging me not to drive
But I took away the keys
And made you climb inside
And I'd take your place in this field of stone
If I only had to power
Look what it took
For me to finally bring you flowers

Lord, I'd take your place in this field of stone
If I only had the power
Look what it took
For me to finally bring you flowers

Yeah look what it took
For me to finally bring you flowers



Found A quarter on the sidewalk
A love letter in a shoebox
I found a snake underneath a rock
Wish I could find forgiveness
A sand dollar on the seashore
An old dresser in an antique store
A rustly whistle in the bottom drawer
Wish I could find forgiveness

[Chorus: - Chris Young]
It ain't hiding in no bottle on a shelf
Or lying in the bed of someone else
I can't feel it on some Sunday morning pew
And one sleepless night it dawned on me
The piece I need so desperately
Is buried in the one place I can't get to
Girl, it's gotta come from you

Was too stubborn for my own good
I never listend like I knew I should
I don'd deserve it but I wish you would
Find me some forgiveness
For every night I wasn't there
For all the times I didn't care
I admit It was never fair
Wish I could find forgiveness

[Chorus: - Chris Young]
It ain't hiding in no bottle on a shelf
Or lying in the bed of someone else
I can't feel it on some Sunday morning pew
And one sleepless night it dawned on me
The piece I need so desperately
Is buried in the one place I can't get to
Girl, it's gotta come from you

I've seen a broom run across a floor
Talking with it that was there before
And that's the kind of clean I came here looking for

[Chorus: - Chris Young]
It ain't hiding in no bottle on a shelf
Or lying in the bed of someone else
I can't feel it on some Sunday morning pew
And one sleepless night it dawned on me
The piece I need so desperately
Is buried in the one place I can't get to
Girl, it's gotta come from you

Wish I could find forgiveness



Tuxedo waiters, black tie
White table clothes and red wine
We've been planning, this night
Looking forward to it,for some time
Now honey I know you love getting dressed up
And you know I love showing you off
But watching your baby blue eyes
Dancing in the candle light glow
All I can think about, is getting you home

[Chorus]
Walking through the front door
Seeing your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing
Like you loving me all night long
And all I can think about is getting you home

I don't need this menu, no I don't
I already know just what I want
Did I hear you right, did you tell me
Go pay the waiter and lets leave
Now honey I know by that look in your eyes
And your hand drawing hearts on mine
That our night out of the house
Ain't gonna last too long
When all you can think about, is getting me home

Walking through the front door
Seeing your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing
Like you loving me all night long
And all I can think about is getting you home

Walking through the front door
Sseeing your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing
Like you loving me all night long
And all I can think about, all I can think about



Knock on my door
You're on my porch
It's about 11:30
And that only means
One of two things
Either you're a little bit lonely
Or something ain't right
And judgin' by
The tear in your eye
You're about to say something crazy
Like goodbye

Stop right there
Don't say a word
Just let me hold you
Girl, we can fix
Whatever it is
So whatever you do
Don't let us die
The love of a lifetime
Is worth at least a million tries
Baby what we got
Is too good for goodbye

This ain't a game
I'm trying to play
Girl, we got something real here
You don't just break up
Whenever it gets tough
So, baby, don't you leave here
I want you to say
You're gonna stay
And we're in this thing forever
Come whatever, so

Stop right there
Don't say a word
Just let me hold you
Girl, we can fix
Whatever it is
So whatever you do
Don't let us die
The love of a lifetime
Is worth at least a million tries
Baby what we got
Is too good for goodbye

It's too good for goodbye

Stop right there
Don't say a word
Just let me hold you
Girl, we can fix
Whatever it is
So whatever you do
Don't let us die
The love of a lifetime
Is worth at least a million tries
Baby what we got
Is too good for goodbye

Yeah, it's too good for goodbye



[Verse 1]
I'm a few drinks in, but that ain't the reason
I'm all tongue tied and my breath's leaving this fast
I can't get past those blue eyes shining
They keep drawing me in to you
Got me fallin' off track
You get me like that

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me

[Verse 2]
It ain't the song, and it ain't the playlist
It's every smile coming off of your sweet lips, yeah
That makes me wanna stay here
No, this ain't a one night, one time thing
You always light me up like a flame and it's clear
Every time you're near

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me
Yeah, you hangin' on to me

[Bridge]
So let me pull you a little closer
Even when the music's over

[Chorus]
I'll be hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me
Yeah, you hangin' on to me



[Verse 1]
It's better than sipping something strong
The way my name rolls off your tongue
The way the light, it hits your eyes and makes me come alive
It moves me more than any song
When you got that shade of lipstick on
Across the room, all by myself

[Chorus]
Baby I can feel my heartbeat, heartbeat
Pound in my chest
You in that dress
Making it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heartbeat, heartbeat
There's no mistaking
Right now it's racing
Every time that you get close to me
Baby I can feel my heartbeat

[Verse 2]
You make me feel like I could fly
Like some old rollercoaster ride
The way you flip your hair
Oh girl it gets me every time
You drive me that perfect kind of crazy and

[Chorus]
Baby I can feel my heartbeat, heartbeat
Pound in my chest
You in that dress
Making it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heartbeat, heartbeat
There's no mistaking
Right now it's racing
Every time that you get close to me
Baby I can feel my heartbeat

[Verse 3]
In the middle of the floor we're swaying
And your favourite song is playing
Girl I'm just saying

[Chorus]
I can feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
Pound in your chest
There in that dress
Making it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heartbeat, heartbeat
There's no mistaking
Right now it's racing
Every time that you get close to me
Baby I can feel my heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat

Baby I can feel your heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat
Baby I can feel our hearts beat



Baby, do you feel that bass line pumpin'
Tell me, can you hear that kick drum thumpin' on the 2 and 4
Let's get on that floor
Love to hear the slide of the guitar ringin'
Melody's sayin' everything I'm thinking
And I'm startin' to think you think it too
I Love the way you're movin'
Feel the backbeat groovin'
I'm gonna hold you to it

Damn, when you start to sway your hips
I start thinkin' about your lips
On mine and mine on them
And I love dancin' with you so much
I ask the DJ to turn it up
And keep playin' that song again and again

Baby, do you feel that bass line pumpin'
Tell me, can you hear that kick drum thumpin' on the 2 and 4
Let's get on that floor
Love to hear the slide of the guitar ringin'
Melody's sayin' everything I'm thinking
And I'm startin' to think you think it too
I Love the way you're movin'
Feel the backbeat groovin'
I'm gonna hold you to it

Baby, do you feel that bass line pumpin'
Tell me, can you hear that kick drum thumpin' on the 2 and 4
Let's get on that floor
Love to hear the slide of the guitar ringin'
Melody's sayin' everything I'm thinking
And I'm startin' to think you think it too
I Love the way you're movin'
Feel the backbeat groovin'
I'm gonna hold you to it

Yeah, I wanna hold you to it



[Verse 1]
I don't need to pack a bag
I don't need a travel agent
Islands look cool on a map
But can't beat my location
'Cause when you smile at me, that's all the sunshine I need
Any place, any time, any day of the week

[Chorus]
You make me wanna make a margarita
You make me wanna put on my shades
You take me on a trip around the world
Don't need to hop a plane
When I'm with ya girl, it's like I'm on vacay
I guess what I'm trying to say is
You make every day like a holiday
You make every day like a holiday

[Verse 2]
When I've I got you in my arms
I'm a thousand miles away
From any worries in the world
Baby, all of that can wait
Cause swaying to some music while I look in your eyes
It's pretty easy to see I'm in paradise

[Chorus]
You make me wanna make a margarita
You make me wanna put on my shades
You take me on a trip around the world
Don't need to hop a plane
When I'm with you girl, it's like I'm on vacay
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is
You make every day like a holiday
Holiday, baby

[Bridge]
Everybody's got a photo of their favorite view
You can see mine in every picture of you

[Chorus]
You make me wanna make a margarita
You make me wanna put on my shades
You take me on a trip around the world
Don't need to hop a plane
When I'm with you girl, it's like I'm on vacay
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is
You make every day like a holiday
Yeah, a holiday, baby



Ain't nothin' goin' on in town tonight
Except a loud party crowd drinkin' too much beer
So baby tell me would it be alright
If we just take a little rain check and stay right here
I'm sure we could find somethin' to do
As a matter of fact baby why don't you grab
A couple glasses and a bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights
And baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take if from there
Yeah I can take it from there

I'm gonna put an ol' record on, Conway Twitty
Yell girl I'd love to lay you down
Kill the ringer on the telephone
Ain't gonna stop lovin' you til the candle burns out

Oh there it is, that little smile of yours
Come on darlin' whatcha waitin' for
Grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and turn down the lights
And baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there

Tomorrows gonna be here way too soon
Let's not waste another minute girl
I got plans for me and you
Just grab a couple glasses and that bottle of wine
Walk down the hall and darlin' turn down those lights
Baby while you're at it you might as well
Let down your hair and I can take it from there
Oh I can take it from there



[Verse 1]
If you need your car towed
If that Volkswagen breaks down on the way out of this town
I know a guy
I'll make a few calls
If you need something part time 'till you're back on your feet
I know a guy

[Chorus]
And if you're looking for someone, barely hanging on
Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Do anything just to hold you
If you're trying to find a man
Who lost his mind
Doesn't sleep at night
Unless he's dreaming about you laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try
Then I know a guy

[Verse 2]
If you would ask me to think of a person that didn't deserve you
I know a guy
And if you needed a man to never really listen
Not know what he'd be missing
I know a guy

[Chorus]
And if you're looking for someone, barely hanging on
Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Do anything just to hold you
If you're trying to find a man
Who lost his mind
Doesn't sleep at night
Unless he's dreaming about you laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try
Then I know a guy

[Bridge]
Yeah, I know a guy
Who feels like a fool
He's been hating himself for what he put you through
He'd take it all back if he only knew how
He knows that you've probably moved on by now

[Chorus]
But if you're looking for someone, barely hanging on
Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Give anything just to hold you
If you're trying to find a man
Who lost his mind
Doesn't sleep at night
Unless he's dreaming about you laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try
Then I know a guy

[Outro]
One, one more try
I know a guy



[Verse 1]
We say goodbye see you around
We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up we make up and we make love
We can’t seem to let go girl

[Chorus]
So I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over

[Verse 2]
I’m all alone, but you’re on my phone
Tellin' me you miss me and that you’re at home
Who knows what we are in the mornin'
All I know is I want you

[Chorus]
So I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over
Ooh, I’m comin' over

[Bridge]
Yeah we said that we’re done and I know that it’s late
But you already know, I’m on my way

[Chorus]
I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire that’s burnin'
I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over
I’m comin' over



They're comin across the border by the thousands everyday
Lookin' for a better life in the good ol' U.S.A
Well, everybody's talkin' about the aliens invadin'
While I'm savin' every dime for a Mexican vacation
Me, I'm headed your way, hasta luego Jose

You say "hola", I'll say "hi"
When I pass you at the border slap me a high five
You better pack a poncho 'cause it sure gets cold up here
Me, I'm headed south for hot women and cheap beer
Here's the keys to my Chevrolet
You can have the house and the bills I pay
Welcome to the good ol' U.S.A
I'm headed your way, Jose
(Cuervo that is, lil' sunshine, some margaritas
Cabo San Lucas, maybe go see Chichinitza, I love that word)

Up here we work our asses off just tryin' to get ahead
But you can't spend a dollar if you've worked yourself to death
From what I hear you way of life is an afternoon siesta
Then back to work for a little while for an all night long fiesta
Me, I'm headed your way
Well sounds to me like a pretty fair trade

You say "hola", I'll say "hi"
When I pass you at the border slap me a high five
You better pack a poncho 'cause it sure gets cold up here
Me, I'm headed south for hot women and cheap beer
Here's the keys to my Chevrolet
You can have the house and the bills I pay
Welcome to the good ol' U.S.A
I'm headed your way, Jose
(White sandy beaches, pesos and jalapenos
Palm trees, ocean breeze, ah man, Dos Equis)

You say "hola", I'll say "hi"
When I pass you at the border slap me a high five
You better pack a poncho 'cause you'll freeze your ass off here
Me, I'm headed south for hot women and cheap beer
Here's the keys to my Chevrolet
You can have the house and the bills I pay
Me, I'm kickin' back in the Mexican shade
I'm headed your way, Jose
(Yeah, I'm hittin' the road, man, give me a little burro to ride on, you
Can have my car, that gas is killin' me)



She locked her fingers and bowed her head
She said I'm late and I'm really scared
Now you can go but I hope you stay
I'm gonna keep it either way

In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through that windshield
I could see my future change
And heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
But it take s a man to raise a child

I laid my head down on the wheel
She said "I know, I know it don't seem real"
She closed her eyes but the tears flowed through
She said "don't hate me for loving you"

In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through that windshield
I could see my future change
And heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
But it take s a man to raise a child

Oh, I could not reassure her
I couldn't say what I had planned
Couldn't put three words together
So I just took her hand

In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through that windshield
I could see my future change
And heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby



Well, they say your kiss is like forbidden fruit
One taste of your sweet strawberry lips
And I'll be hooked on you, they
Say one day just like a dog
You'll own me I say lay it on me I'm six foot four and tough as a man can be
I ain't scared of much, I'll buck right up, there's a fightin' side of me
They say I'll turn to putty and you'll mold me, well lay it on me

You might be more then I can stand, after all honey
I'm just one man, I might wind up sad, beat down and lonely, but
I'm watching the way them jeans low ride, your belly button ring and big blue
Eyes
And I can hardly wait for you to hold me
Come on and lay it on me, well
That "born to break hearts" tattoo don't faze me
So, stroll your sweet self over here, and
Bring me to my knees, and we'll see who comes out on top
Now won't we, lay it on me, you might be more then I can stand
After all honey, I'm just one man, I might wind up sad
Beat down and lonely, but I'm watching the way them jeans low ride
Your belly button ring and big blue eyes, and I can hardly wait for you to hold
Me
Come on and lay it on me, well, lay down
The lawer lay it all on the line, girl I don't care as long as you lay your body
Next to mine
And if your afraid of falling
Darlin' don't be come on and lay it on me, I say lay it on me, come on lay it on



[Verse 1]
I know it's seven o' clock
I know I've already got a dinner reservation set for two
We made a plan to go out, but all I'm thinking  about is me laying
Right here beside you
So if you change your mind and tell me that you wanna stay
At home instead of going, you know what I'm gonna say
As long as I got your eyes staring back into mine
I got everything that I need

[Chorus]
We don't gotta leave this room
You don't have to get dressed up for me tonight
Girl, to get me staring at you
You look good in any light
You're gonna leave me breathless
Even if we never walk out that door
We don't gotta leave this room
For you to leave me wanting more (for you to leave me wanting more)

[Verse 2]
Wanting more of your kiss landing right on my lips
Leaning right into me, skin on skin
Wanting more of just of us falling deeper in love
Over and over again

[Chorus]
We don't gotta leave this room
You don't have to get dressed up for me tonight
Girl, to get me staring at you
You look good in any light
You're gonna leave me breathless
Even if we never walk out that door
We don't gotta leave this room
For you to leave me wanting more
For you to leave me wanting more

[Bridge]
So, when you pull me close and tell me that you wanna stay
At home with me, girl, everytime you know I'm gonna stay

[Chorus]
We don't gotta leave this room
You don't have to get dressed up for me tonight
Girl, to get me staring at you
You look good in any light
You're gonna leave me breathless
Even if we never walk out that door
We don't gotta leave this room
For you to leave me wanting more
You always leave me wanting more



Cover band ona Flora-Bama deck
A thousand sun-burned souls
Rum-runners and cold Bud Light
A little Friday night summertime rock and roll
Packed in tight, they were singin' along
I was hanging on the edge of the crowd
When you spilled your beer down the back of my shirt
You had me when I turned around

[Chorus:]
Guitars on the Gulf breeze
Smoke rings 'round the neon
Moonlight in your blue eyes
'Neath that Georgia hat that you had on
Just one night to hold you
No, that ain't what I call fair
But the memories burn in my mind
Like those lighters in the air
Lighters in the air

That one look led to a walk on the beach
And more kisses than I could count
The best kind of wild and down-home smile
I've ever had these arms around
The ams were screamin' and the people were too
While were slow dancing on our bare feet
Ain't it funny how we missed it all
And still didn't miss a thing?

[Repeat Chorus]

The thought of you won't let me go
It's been holding on for years
It don't take much to take me back
Everytime I hear

[Repeat Chorus]

Raise your lighters in the air



[Verse 1]
Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low
Baby, let's just lose control, lose control
I can handle every single curve, you know
That I love you, let me show you, oh

[Chorus]
Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep

[Verse 2]
Real life, when it's this good don't you know
We don't need to dream at all
Baby, so...

[Chorus]
Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep

Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be, yeah
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep
When we're losing sleep
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing

[Outro]
Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low



I'm out on the highway, just about a mile away
Meet me out in the driveway
I'm gonna be there soon
I'll swing by and pick you up
Don't bother getting fixed up
Me and you and this old truck will find something to do
No I ain't got no plan in mind
It's such a perfect night so I just thought
We could go get lost

Lost down some old back road
Lost in a song on the radio
Lost in your deep blue eyes
I don't care if we spend all night
Lost by the river cross the turnpike
Somewhere near nowhere is my favorite thing to do
Won't you say girl me and you
Go get a little lost

Come on baby let's go
When we get there we'll know
No bars on the cellphone
Sounds good to me
We can find us a place to park
By the water underneath the stars
And do a little "fishin' in the dark"
If you know what I mean
Well all we need's a tank a gas
So grab that GPS and turn it off
Let's go get lost

Lost down some old back road
Lost in a song on the radio
Lost in your deep blue eyes
I don't care if we spend all night
Lost by the river cross the turnpike
Somewhere near nowhere is my favorite thing to do
Won't you say girl me and you
Go get a little lost

No I ain't got no plan in mind
And it's such a perfect night
So I just thought we could get

Lost down some old back road
Lost in a song on the radio
Lost in your deep blue eyes
I don't care if we spend all night
Lost by the river cross the turnpike
Somewhere near nowhere is my favorite thing to do
Won't you say girl me and you
Go get a little lost



The sky in Cheyenne, Wyoming
Is just about as blue as it gets
And if you ain't seen a Santa Fe sunset
You ain't seen red

Texas sunflower yellow
Can take your breath away
I've seen it all, from the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer but my favorite color is

Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on

The buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is neon

The sun can do the job in the daytime
But the moon ain't quite bright enough
To light up the way to playtime
For people like us

Just like a beach side beacon
Callin' all the ships back home
A few thousand volts to cut through the smoke
The windows are tinted that's why they invented

Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on

It's the buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is always neon

You know I've seen it all
From the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer
But my favorite color is

Neon, the light they always leave on
Put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is neon



Been waitin' all week
About to bust loose
Get the party iced down in my off-shore Igloo
Everybody's gatherin' around
Wherever we are that's where we're throwin' down

[Chorus:]
Oh, yeah
Everybody grab a cold beer
Pop it open, raise it up in the air
Bump cans with your neighbor, yeah
Here's to good ole boys and country girls everywhere
Livin' loud, rockin' out to the sound of our favorite songs
Y'all sing along, this night ain't over yet
We're gonna stay right here til there's nothing but the cooler left

Ain't gonna waste one drop of this Friday night
Been buildin' up a thirst for a hell of a time
Got my boots on and ready to kick it off, brother
If you're runnin' low, holler throw me another

[Repeat Chorus]

Oh, yeah
Everybody grab a cold beer
Pop it open, raise it up in the air
Bump cans with your neighbor, yeah
Here's to good ole boys and country girls everywhere
Livin' loud, rockin' out to the sound of our favorite songs
Y'all sing along, this night ain't over yet
We're gonna stay right here til there's nothing but the cooler left

Yeah, dance along, drink along
Come On, get your party on
Everybody with me 'til there's nothin' but the cooler left
Sip it son, shotgun
Either way we're ending up a couple past tipsy
With nothin' but the cooler left



Grand-daddy always said when he was 17
He met the girl, the one in all his dreams
And man that was it was it he never once looked back
He found something he just knew was gonna last
And if you ask him bout that day
He’ll just tap his chest
And say

That’s how you
When it grabs a hold and won’t let go
And you feel like she’s always been in your soul
And as time goes by she’s still surprising you
That’s how you it’s true
When a new love feels old
And an old love feels new

He said I walked up to her door
And I was shaking like a leave there on her porch
Til she flashed that smile at me
Son she took my breathe away
And she still does to this day

That’s how you know
When it grabs a hold of you and won’t let go
When you feel like she’s always been in your soul
And as time goes by she’s still surprising you
That’s how you know it’s true
When a new love feel old
And an old love feels new

And now I finally see just what he means
Cause that’s how I feel
Now that you’re with me

That’s how I know
Cause you grabbed a hold of me and won’t let go
And it feels like you’ve always been in my soul
That’s how you know
When it grabs a hold and won’t let go
When you feel like she’s always been in your soul
And as time goes by she’s still surprising you
That’s how you know it’s true
When a new love feels old
And an old love feels new



[Verse 1]
It's really coming down outside
Every now and then a rumble of thunder rolls across the sky
But the way you're crawling into my seat
I can tell this storm tonight will have nothing on you and me

[Chorus]
Every song that's coming on is setting the mood tonight
Gettin' us right
Like every kiss off of your lips, hitting me stronger than
A lightning strike
Never heard anything like that
The way you whisper my name
Making love to the soundtrack
Of the radio and the rain

[Verse 2]
I don't see nothing but your silhouette
Illuminated by the panel on my dash, it's got you back-lit
And the way we're fogging up the windows
I guess it's a pretty good thing we're parked out on some no name road

[Chorus]
Every song that's coming on is setting the mood tonight
Gettin' us right
Like every kiss off of your lips, hitting me stronger than
A lightning strike
Never heard anything like that
The way you whisper my name
Making love to the soundtrack
Of the radio and the rain
The radio and the rain

[Bridge]
It's really coming down outside
And I got your shadow fading into mine

[Chorus]
Every song that's coming on is setting the mood tonight
Gettin' us right
Like every kiss off of your lips, hitting me stronger than
A lightning strike
Never heard anything like that
The way you whisper my name
Making love to the soundtrack
Of the radio and the rain
The radio and the rain



Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain is fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin', "It's all right"

Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs flashin'
Taxi cabs and buses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Seems like it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
And it still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
It's life, and you just gotta play the game

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out this old guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest and I'm alright

Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Yeah, I believe it's rainin' all over the world



She was a flower for the takin'
Her beauty cut just like a knife
He was a banker from Macon
Swore he'd love her all his life

Bought her a mansion on a mountain
With a formal garden and a lot a land

But paradise became her prison
That Georgia banker was a jealous man

Every time he'd talk about her
You could see the fire in his eyes
He'd say
I would walk through Hell on Sunday
To keep my Rose in Paradise

He hired a man to tend the garden
Keep an eye on her while he was gone
Some say they ran away together
Some say that gardener left alone

Now the banker is an old man
That mansion's crum-ble-ing down
He sits all day and stares at the garden
Not a trace of her was ever found

Every time he talks about her
You can see the fire in his eyes
He'd say, "I would walk through Hell on Sunday
To keep my Rose in Paradise

Now there's a rose out in the garden
Its beauty cuts just like a knife
They say that it even grows in the winter time
And blooms in the dead of the night



It ain’t rained in four months
One cigarette spark’ll burn the whole town up
That ole well is plum dry
City put a limit on the water you can buy
We don’t mind cause round her
We save water, and drink beer

Ice cold, genuine, raise ‘em up, drip ‘em dry
Hollar and Swaller ya’ll support your local wildlife
Do your part around here
Just save water, and drink beer

We’re going green hey look at us
We’re maybe even doing just a little too much
Poppin’ tops, getting’ tans
And that’s the price we’ll pay
Til the long drought ends
We help the world ‘round here
We save water, and drink beer

Ice cold, genuine, raise ‘em up, drip ‘em dry
Hollar and Swaller ya’ll support your local wildlife
Do your part around here
Just save water, and drink beer

Drink beer

Volunteer, we’ll start tonight
Plant a seed, and tell friends
They got to drink a little

Ice cold, genuine, raise ‘em up, drip ‘em dry
Holler and Swaller ya’ll support your local wildlife
Do your part around here
Just save water, and drink beer

Say it loud, say it clear
Save water, drink beer



[Chorus]
I've been a Friday night rambler
I've been a do what I please
I was a never get tied down member of the bar crowd
That's my scene
It was a whiskey on the rocks
Type to stay out way too late
But the first time she walked in and I saw her
Damn near all that changed

[Chorus]
She's got a way to get me spinning off track
She's got a way when she flips her hair back
Yeah, she knows that I'm staring like she's daring me to look away
She's got a way when she dances like that
She's gotten good at making me want her bad
Never thought I'd be here fallin' all in love, but what can I say?
She's got a way (hey)
Yeah, she's got a way (hey)

[Verse 2]
She's a different kinda party
She's a different kinda watching that sun come up
Staying in on Friday nights now, I get an even better buzz

[Chorus]
She's got a way to get me spinning off track
She's got a way when she flips her hair back
Yeah, she knows that I'm staring like she's daring me to look away
She's got a way when she dances like that
She's gotten good at making me want her bad
Never thought I'd be here fallin' all in love, but what can I say?
She's got a way
Yeah, she's got a way

She's got a way to get me spinning off track
She's got a way when she flips her hair back
Yeah, she knows that I'm staring like she's saying don't look away
She's got a way when she dances like that
She's gotten good at me wanting her bad
Never thought I'd be here fallin' all in love, but what can I say?
She's got a way
Yeah, she's got a way

[Outro]
She's got a way
Yeah, she's got a way (hey)



It might be your smile, cause it can change my day
Blue eyes that chase my blues away
It might be your touch
That keeps me coming back for more
Loving words that keep me going strong
That heart of hers I hang my future on

What it is, well, I can't say for sure
It's just she's got this thing about her
She's got this thing about her

Like the magic in your favorite song
You just can't put your finger on
In her arms when we're all alone
I get the feeling that I've come back home
She's got this thing about her

She stops time when she moves through a room
When she leaves she's always gone too soon
And I'm counting down the minutes till she's back
She's the love I've known eternally
It always feels brand new to me
I can't separate the fiction from the fact

It's just she's got this thing about her
She's got this thing about her

Like a hymn in a cathedral hall
Watching April snowflakes fall
In her arms when we're all alone
I get the feeling that I come back home
She's got this thing about her

Like the magic in your favorite song
You just can't put your finger on
She's got this thing about her



Hangin' out at the old park pool
Right after Sunday school
Banana Boat, a rubber float
Another summer afternoon

Bon fire at the creek tonight
Bubba bringin' some homemade wine
Just enough to catch a buzz
And get us countrified

Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time

A population 903
Half of them are kin to me
And those that ain't they know my name
We're like one big family

Gather at that old camp site
To lie about the fish and their size
Uncle Carl and his old guitar
Singin' Louisiana Saturday Night!

Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time

Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time



[Verse 1: Chris Young]
I feel terrible, sunlight's hurting my eyes
So I pull the shades and I make my place as black as night
I feel miserable, and I'm missing you and me
'Nother Sunday morning all alone underneath these sheets

[Chorus: Chris Young and Vince Gill]
No I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over you
All messed up, all strung out
I was sitting at home, breaking down
Not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night

[Verse 2: Chris Young]
Besides the pain, I don't feel a thing
When my buddies call me up, I just let it ring

[Chorus: Chris Young and Vince Gill]
No I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over you
All messed up, all strung out
I was sitting at home, breaking down
Not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night

[Outro: Chris Young and Vince Gill]
No I'm not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night



[Verse 1]
If you're tired of the glass being half full
Burnin' at both ends and you're burnt out
Sometimes you got to go a little coastal
Take the truck and point it south

[Chorus]
Work in a little sunshine overtime
Checking on out of that nine to five
Sandy streets and the windows down
Hair free in the breeze, getting all unwound
Jump in the water, go weekend wild
Get wrapped up in an old beach towel
Break out tequila, salt and the lime
Workin' sunshine overtime

[Verse 2]
Man there's just something about the ocean
Flip flops and tank tops, and tan lines
Makes you wanna grab the sun tan lotion
And let your worries roll out with the tide

[Chorus]
Work in a little sunshine overtime
Checking on out of that nine to five
Sandy streets and the windows down
Hair free in the breeze, getting all unwound
Jump in the water, go weekend wild
Get wrapped up in an old beach towel
Break out tequila, salt and the lime
Workin' sunshine overtime

[Bridge]
It's the kind of fun
That's hard to stop
When it's started
So raise a cup and punch the clock on a party
Work in a little sunshine overtime

[Chorus]
Work in a little sunshine overtime
Checking on out of that nine to five
Sandy streets and the windows down
Hair free in the breeze, getting all unwound
Jump in the water, go weekend wild
Get wrapped up in an old beach towel
Break out tequila, salt and the lime
Workin' sunshine overtime
Work in a little sunshine overtime



Who's in Houston that's keepin' you from talkin' to me
I ain't used to layin' down without the sound of your voice
Before I drift off to sleep
Girl, you got me climbin' the walls
If you can't find the time to call

Come on and text me, Texas
Before you turn off your phone
I'm a wreck and I'm restless
Gotta feelin' that you're not alone
It's breakin' my heart and I'm startin' to get the message
Come on and text me, Texas

I pray what you ain't sayin' don't mean what all my friends say it means
Maybe you can give me just a couple of lines I could read between
You could even tell me a lie
Anything to get me by

Come on and text me, Texas
Before you turn off your phone
I'm a wreck and I'm restless
Gotta feelin' that you're not a lone
Yeah it's breakin' my heart and I'm startin' to get the message
Come on and text me, Texas

Whatever you can't tell me now
Baby, you could spell it out
Come on and text me, Texas
Before you turn off your phone
I'm a wreck and restlesss
Got this feelin' that you're not alone
It's breakin' my heart and I'm startin' to get the message
Come on and text me Texas



I like an old guitar
Playin' a Gosdin song
In a smoky bar
That's what turns me on, yeah

If that makes me a little old school
Go ahead and call me yesterday's old fool
If that makes me a little throwback
Throw it at me, don't worry, I can take that
Call me hick, hillbilly Hell I'm proud to be What makes me

I like a 60's truck
The kind that's solid steel
The kind that always runs
It takes a man to turn that wheel

If that makes me a little old school
Go ahead and call me yesterday's old fool
If that makes me a little throwback
Throw it at me, don't worry, I can take that
Call me hick, hillbilly Hell I'm proud to be What makes me

Yeah, I don't swear in front of no woman
I answer yes, sir to my old man
I drink my liquor with a side of nothin'
Yeah, good and country that's what I am

If that makes me a little old school
Go ahead and call me yesterday's old fool
If that makes me a little throwback
Throw it at me, don't worry, I can take that



We laughed and joked in the cab of his truck
Just my brother and me
The night before he shipped out overseas
A leatherneck, Jarhead Marine

He said "the Radiator leaks
And the timing-belt is worn
But the Heart and Soul of this old beat up truck
Is The Dashboard."

"It's seen alot of tan legs
Got a kick ass radio
Heard a lot of singing along with some country songs
And rock and roll
Got a .38 bullet hole, courtesy of Kate Tillman's dad
A lot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photographs."
He said "If I don't come back
You can have this Ford
Just tape a picture of me, on the dashboard."

He said "The paint is peeling off
It's got dents in both the doors
If something happens to me
Don't hang a for-sale sign above the dashboard."

"It's seen alot of tan legs
Got a kick ass radio
Heard alot of singing along with some country songs
And rock and roll
Got a .38 bullet hole, courtesy of Kate Tillman's dad
Alot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photographs."
He said "If I don't come back
You can have this Ford
Just tape a picture of me, on the dashboard."

I Had the Engine overhauled
A paint-job and brand new chrome
I Had her washed and waxed, sittin' in the drive
The day that he came home

I said "Here's the keys
She's all yours
I fixed everything



God, I'm down here on my knees
Cause it's the last place left to fall
Beggin' for another chance
If there's any chance at all
That you might still be listenin'
Lovin' and forgivin' guys like me
I've spent my whole life gettin' it all wrong
And I sure could use your help, cause from now on

I wanna be a good man
A "do like I should" man
I wanna be the kind of man the mirror likes to see
I wanna be a strong man
And admit that I was wrong, man
God, I'm asking you to come change me
To the man I wanna be

There's any way for her and me to make another start
Could you see what you could do
To put some love back in her heart
Cause it's going to take a miracle
After all I've done to really make her see

That I wanna be a stay man
I wanna be a great man
I wanna be the kind of man that she sees in her dreams
God, I wanna be your man
And I wanna be her man
God, I only hope she still believes
In the man I wanna be

Well, I know this late at night that talk is cheap
Lord, don't give up on me

I wanna be a givin' man
I wanna really start livin', man
God, I'm asking you to come change me



I stumbled on a bunch of junk of mine
In a shoebox the other night
In between cleaning up piles of messes
That I've made of my life
Ticket stubs, love poems and old letters
I dumped them all out on the bed
Found a homemade birthday card from my mom
And this is what it said
Yeah, this is what it said

Don't forget the little moments
They're the ones that mean the most
When the way home seems so far away
Take 'em out and hold them close
And take a picture with your father
'Cause one day he'll be gone
And don't forget to fill an old shoebox
Full of things to look back on
Full of things to look back on

I opened up my grandpa's pocket knife
And I was back to his back porch
It was summertime, I was turning nine
He said you want that knife, it's yours
I remember running off in the yard
Carved my name in every tree
I haven't held it since he passed away
Man it meant the world to me
Because he meant the world to me

Don't forget the little moments
They're the ones that mean the most
When the way home seems so far away
Take 'em out and hold them close
And take a picture with your father
'Cause one day he'll be gone
And don't forget to fill an old shoebox
Full of things to look back on

Look back on
A little window to the past
Look back on
God knows life goes by so fast
If ever you should ever doubt the blessings that you've had

Don't forget the little moments
They're the ones that mean the most
When the way home seems so far away
Take 'em out and hold them close
And take a picture with your father
'Cause one day he'll be gone
And don't forget to fill an old shoebox
Full of things to look back on

I stumbled on a bunch of junk of mine



[Verse 1: Chris Young]
I walk in on Friday nights
Same old bar, same burned out lights
Same people and all the same faces
So why in the hell does it feel like a different place?

[Verse 2: Cassadee Pope]
Meet my friends for a girls' night out
Seems there ain't much to talk about
Same drinks that we're all raising
But all of the toasts just don't feel the same

[Chorus: Both]
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you

[Verse 3: Chris Young & Both]
They keep asking how I am
But they're really asking where you've been
I can read between all of the lines
It ain't just us missing all of the times

[Chorus: Both]
We were the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you

[Bridge: Chris Young & Cassadee Pope]
Ain't it funny how a flame like that
Oh whoa, when they think of you
It can burn when it's in the past

[Chorus: Both]
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you

[Outro: Both]
Oh, they think of you
When they think of me
Baby, baby, oh
When they think of me, they think of you



[Verse 1]
Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would
And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
To that voice of reason inside my head telling me that we're no good

[Chorus]
But tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow I'll be stronger
I'm not gonna break down and call you up when my heart cries out for you
And tomorrow, you won't believe it
But when I pass your house, I won't stop no matter how bad I want to

[Chorus]
But tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no

Tomorrow

[Bridge]
Baby when we're good, you know we're great
But there's too much bad for us to think
There's anything worth trying to save

[Chorus]
But tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no

Tomorrow, I'm gonna leave here
And I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would



[Verse 1]
Girl, I know you didn't come here just for the free beer
Came to put some jaws on the ground
Turn this place upside down
You stand out on the dance floor
Song stops and I want more
Your eyes lock into mine
Lord, help me tonight

[Chorus]
Cause I know I'm gonna fall for you
My mind, I'm gonna lose it
All the warning signs are flashing
I can't help it, I just gotta have that
Kinda smile that leads to something that I shouldn't be doing
I can tell by the way you're laughing
You're trouble looking for a place to happen

[Verse 2]
We start talking and ya lean in
Already drowning in the deep end
I wannna kiss your lips, there's no way out of this

[Chorus]
Cause I know I'm gonna fall for you
My mind, I'm gonna lose it
All the warning signs are flashing
I can't help it, I just gotta have that
Kinda smile that leads to something that I shouldn't be doing
I can tell by the way you're laughing
You're trouble looking for a place to happen

[Bridge]
And it can happen with me tonight
Mess me up, girl, I won't fight it

[Chorus]
Cause I know I'm gonna fall for you
My mind, I'm gonna lose it
The warning signs are flashing
I can't help it, I just gotta have that
Kinda smile that leads to something that I shouldn't be doing
I can tell by the way you're laughing
You're trouble looking for a place to happen

[Outro]
Trouble looking for a place to happen, baby
You stand out on the dance floor
Already drowning in the deep end
The song stops and I want more



Always be momma's baby, always be daddy's girl
Right now she's makin' 'em crazy
Little Red Robin' Hood, big bad world

She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
She ain't missin' not a minutes of fun
She ain't worried 'bout one day older
Pretty little rebel on the run
She ain't trying to be hard to handle
She gonna do what a girl gonna do
She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
Sure ain't gonna wait on you

Can't be innocent forever, ain't never done anything
She'll tell you no but she don't mean never
Turned a corner when she turned eighteen

She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
She ain't missin' not a minutes of fun
She ain't worried 'bout one day older
Pretty little rebel on the run
She ain't trying to be hard to handle
She gonna do what a girl gonna do
She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
Sure ain't gonna wait on you

Her folks want to hold her back, but they don't know how
She wants it all and she wants it all right now
Gonna get it all before the sun goes down
She ain't waitin'
She ain't missin'
She ain't worried
That girl needs kissing

She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
She ain't missin' not a minutes of fun
She ain't worried 'bout one day older
Pretty little rebel on the run
She ain't trying to be hard to handle
She gonna do what a girl gonna do
She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
Sure ain't gonna wait on you



[Verse 1]
Hometown crowd, Friday night lights
Second string quarterback coming off the sidelines
One last play, hail Mary prayer
Holding their breath when he threw it in the air
Now cups are raising, flags are waving
He's on their shoulders, famous

[Chorus]
Here's one for the underdogs
Let 'em hear y'all
Well hell yeah they might get knocked down
But everybody loves how they don't stay down for long
Pretty soon they're ten feet tall
From odds stacked, can't win, to the Comeback Kid
Yeah, come on, here's one for the underdogs

[Verse 2]
Granddad's farm, handed down
Everybody said he'd run it in the ground
Spent four long years bailing that hay
Little by little got the whole loan paid
Hard work's paying off, you wouldn't believe
He's making small town history

[Chorus]
Here's one for the underdogs
Let 'em hear y'all
Well hell yeah they might get knocked down
But everybody loves how they don't stay down for long
Pretty soon they're ten feet tall
From odds stacked, can't win, to the Comeback Kid
Yeah, come on, here's one for the underdogs

[Chorus]
Here's one for the underdogs
Let 'em hear y'all
Well hell yeah they might get knocked down
But everybody loves how they don't stay down for long
Pretty soon they're ten feet tall
From odds stacked, can't win, to the Comeback Kid
Yeah, come on, here's one for the underdogs

[Tag]
Yeah, here's one for the underdogs



[Verse 1]
You could say I'm a little bit crazy
You could call me insane
Walking around with all these whispers
Running around here in my brain
I just can't help but hear 'em
Man, I can't avoid it, I hear voices
I hear voices

[Chorus]
Like, my dad saying work that job
But don't work your life away
And momma telling me to drop some cash
Into the offering plate on Sunday
And Granddad saying you can have a few
But don't ever cross that line
Yeah, I hear voices all the time

[Verse 2]
Turns out I'm pretty dang lucky
For all that good advice
Those hard to find words of wisdom
Hold up here in my life
And just when I lost my way
Or I got too many choices, I hear voices
I hear voices

[Chorus]
Like, my dad saying quit that team
And you'll be a quitter for the rest of your life
And Momma telling me to say a prayer
Every time I lay down at night
And Grandma saying if you find the one
You better treat her right
Yeah, I hear voices all the time

[Bridge]
Sometimes I try to ignore them
But I thank God for them
'Cause they made me who I am

[Chorus]
My dad saying work that job
But don't work your life away
And Momma telling me to drop some cash
In the offering plate on Sunday
And Granddad saying you can have a few
But don't ever cross that line
Yeah, I hear voices all the time

[Outro]
Yeah, I hear voices all the time
All the time



This ain't no candlelight
Warm glass of wine night
It's more a whiskey water
Drink that's on the rocks kind
Let's crank the radio
Get this truck on into town
Somebody call the fire department
We're gonna burn it down
Girl, I can see it in your eyes
I know you're feeling like getting wild

[Chorus:]
Whatever gets you moving
Gets you grooving
Gets you fired up
We're gonna get it
If you really want it bad enough
Yeah, we're gonna chase it
Get all crazy
Gonna lose our minds
Whatever's gonna get you feeling right
Girl, we're gonna find it tonight

You call your girlfriends up
And I'll call some boys of mine
I know the bouncer at the bar
No we don't stand in line
I'll hit the DJ with some money
He'll play all your songs
We're gonna get it right
Even if it's all wrong
Girl, I can see you're eyes
I know you're feeling like getting wild

[Repeat Chorus]

Girl, I can see it in your eyes
Gonna have fun when we get home tonight

[Repeat Chorus]

We're gonna find it tonight
Yeah, we're gonna find it tonight
Whatever's gonna get you feeling right
Girl, we're gonna find it tonight



[Verse 1]
Did you see the movie is over
I guess we missed the last half
Layin' here in this bed together
Me kissin' you, you kissin' me back
It's getting late can't you see
I should get up and leave
If I don't you know where it's goin'

[Chorus 1]
But you're givin' me that look baby
That says you're up to no good maybe
And you're whispering into my neck
Leavin' thoughts inside my head
Well now, since you put it that way
If I need to, I'll go darlin'
But what if I stay
What if I stay

[Verse 2]
Here comes that sun through the window
Feels like we just got to sleep
But the way you look on that pillow
Don't you know it's killin' me yeah
It's getting early can't ya see
I should get up and leave
If I don't you know where it's goin'

[Chorus 2]
But you're givin' me that look baby
That says you're up to no good maybe
And you're whispering into my neck
Leavin' thoughts inside my head
Well now, since you put it that way
If I need to, I'll go darlin'
But what if I stay wrapped up in your arms

[Chorus 3]
Cause lovin' you baby's been pretty perfect so far
And you're givin' me that look
The one that says you're up to no good yeah
And now you're whispering into my neck
Leavin' thoughts inside my head
Well now, since you put it that way
I should probably go darlin'
But what if I stay
What if I stay
Oh what if I stay



She turns every head coming down the sidewalk
In that red sundress that she just bought
Causing a traffic jam on a greenlight
A string of pearls showing off her suntan
And all those curls dancing ‘round her RayBans
If you think that’s something to see

You ought to see her when she’s on that front porch
In those cut-off jeans
And that Texas Longhorns t-shirt
Hair drying in the breeze
Humming along to some old Haggard song
You ought to see her when she’s on

Down at the office in those high heels
Looking like a million, closing big deals
She’ll remind the boys eyes are way up here
Yeah that’ll make you smile ear to ear

You ought to see her when she’s on that leather couch
Reading that fairy tale
To a sleepy eyed little girl
In pajamas and ponytails
Saying one day your prince charming will come along
You ought to see her when she’s on

Oh you ought to see her when she’s on that front porch
In those old cut-off jeans
And that Texas Longhorns t-shirt
Smiling back at me
When you see her dressed to kill
And it drops your jaw
You ought to see her when she’s on that leather couch
Reading that fairy tale that’s when she’s on
That’s when she’s on that front porch
In those old cut-off jeans
That’s when she’s on

Oh when she’s on
That’s when she’s on



[Verse 1]
There's a barstool downtown with my name on it
There's a party crowd promising a good time
But I ain't goin'
Used to be, I'd be there
Throwin' a couple down
But now one leads to two, and two leads to four
And before I know it, I'm thinking about

[Chorus]
Standing at the end of the drive
Your tail lights fading into the night
Screaming your name in the pouring down rain
Watching you leave us behind
So I don't go out on the town
All the whiskey I had, I poured out
My heart needs time to get over you and me
And that's where I go when I drink

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like I could have a few
But I know better your memory's no quitter
And every time I do, I'm...

[Chorus]
Standing at the end of the drive
Your tail lights fading into the night
Screaming your name in the pouring down rain
Watching you leave us behind
So I don't go out on the town
All the whiskey I had, I poured out
My heart needs time to get over you and me
And that's where I go when I drink

[Bridge]
One drop, you flood my mind
Like a river of goodbye
And I'm..

[Chorus]
Standing at the end of the drive
Your tail lights fading into the night
Screaming your name in pouring down rain
Watching you leave us behind
So I don't go out on the town
All the whiskey I had, I poured out
My heart needs time to get over you and me
And that's where I go when I drink

[Outro]
When I drink
That's where I go when I drink



It was the thirtyfirst gathering of the
Thompsons, Joneses, and Smiths
There were tables full of chicken
Taters, collard greens, and grits
Well it all took place at Hatie Lake State Park
Volleyball, fishin', badmitton, yard darts
Aunt Irene said she'd never seen a turnout like this

Well it started with hand shakes
And lordy, how the babies have grown
As the sun got hotter the day got to draggin' along
I saw Uncle Gene comin' back from his car
With somethin' clear as water in a mason jar
The lemonade got hearty and, Lordy, the party was on

That ol' boom box got louder and louder
Actin' civilzed didn't seem to matter
Everybody got to showin' their hiney includin' me
Lord I'd never known Granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree

Well cousin Johnny was a gator
Jimmy was a UT fan
And that football talk
Was quickly gettin out of hand
Granny told Uncle Dave that she hated his guts
Got right up in his face said, your whole famn damily's nuts
Chicken legs got to flyin'
And the whoop started hittin' the fan

Yeah, that ol' boom box got louder and louder
Actin' civilzed didn't seem to matter
Everybody got to showin' their hiney includin' me
Lord I'd never known Granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree

That ol' park ranger jumped out of his car
Said, listen here folks, it's gone a little too far
Tear it all down, pack it all up
Call it quits while there's still a little love

Yeah I've never known Granny to take her a sip
But the words were a slurrin' comin' off of her lips
And it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree

Yeah it dawned on me
White lightnin' hit the family tree

Aw, but they had a good time now
Take it home ya'll



I've been a rolling stone all my life
Flying all alone, flying blind
I've seen it all, I've been around
I've been lost and I've been found but

Who I am with you is who I really want to be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you

I've got a ways to go on this ride
But I got a hand to hold that fits just right
You make me laugh, you make me high
You make me want to hold on tight, cause

Who I am with you is who I really want to be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you

Because of you I'm a lucky man
You're the best part of who I am

Who I am with you is who I really want to be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you

Yes, who I am with you



Bartender's sittin' them shots on the bar
Those last two Jagar bombs hit me hard
My best friend left and took the keys to my car
Who's gonna take me home?

That dad gum Jimmy he took me out back
Pulled a Marlboro cigarette out of his cap
Now I remember why I quit all that
Who's gonna take me home?

Well, I can't drive, I can't walk
And I'm a little too high to crawl
I'll hold up this wall
Till I come down or the room stops spinnin'
Gonna stand right here and chill out for a minute

Standin' in the men's room waitin' on a stall
Lean my head up against the cool concrete wall
Hey there's a few numbers I guess I could call
Who's gonna take me home?
(Where's my cell phone?)

Well, I can't drive, I can't walk
And I'm a little too high to crawl
I'll hold up this wall
Till I come down or the room stops spinnin'
Gonna stand right here, Oh wait just a minute!

Twelve little hotties crammed in a back booth
With a bachelorette all drinkin' Vermouth
Lucky for there's just enough room

Well hello girls, next round's on me
Toast a few drinks to the bide to be
Close the town down and then we'll see
Who's gonna take me home?

Yeah, who's gonna take me home?
Yeah, who's gonna take me home?

I can't drive
I can't walk
Too high
To crawl



[Verse 1]
There's empty champagne glasses
And our clothes, they're all scattered across the room
Your high-heeled shoes are right where you kicked them off
Your head's laying on my chest
And your brown eyes are stealing my breath
Just me and you, and the sun coming through the window
Is all we have on, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I can't help but love, this view, I can't get enough
Of looking at you with that sleepy little smile on your face
Girl, you got a way
With a touch, you can get to me
This morning is like a dream
Maybe the only think better than all night long with you is
That we woke up like this

[Verse 2]
With nothing for us to do, but lay here way past noon
Girl, if you want to, you know I wanna start every day like this

[Chorus]
Yeah, I can't help but love, this view, I can't get enough
Of looking at you with that sleepy little smile on your face
Girl, you got a way
With a touch, you can get to me
This morning is like a dream
Maybe the only thing better than all night long with you is
That we woke up like this
We woke up like this

Yeah, I can't help but love, this view, I can't get enough
Of looking at you with that sleepy little smile on your face
Girl, you got a way
With a touch, you can get to me
This morning is like a dream
Maybe the only think better than all night long with you is
That we woke up like this
We woke up like this



[Verse 1]
Got you cranked up loud, getting pumped for the night
But when we pull in her drive gonna turn you down quiet
I'll have one arm around her, one on the wheel
Hey radio, let's make a deal

[Chorus]
I'll do the driving, you get us going
Play us a summer song that she knows and
I'll find a spot, I'll pull it over
You slow it down and I'll pull her closer
I'll find the moon and you bring the backbeat
You set the mood, we'll dance in the front seat
Hey radio, while you're playing we'll be falling
I'll do the kissin', you do the talkin'

[Verse 2]
Let's make it a night that she'll never forget
Put nothing but thinking 'bout love in her head
With nothing but the glow of your light in the dark
Take us home with the one that we call ours

[Chorus]
I'll do the driving, you get us going
Play us a summer song that she knows and
I'll find a spot, I'll pull it over
You slow it down and I'll pull her closer
I'll find the moon and you bring the backbeat
You set the mood, we'll dance in the front seat
Hey radio, while you're playing we'll be falling
I'll do the kissin', you do the talkin'

[Chorus]
I'll do the driving, you get us going
Play us a summer song that she knows and
I'll find a spot, I'll pull it over
You slow it down and I'll pull her closer
I'll find the moon and you bring the backbeat
You set the mood, we'll dance in the front seat
Hey radio, while you're playing we'll be falling
Hey radio, while you're playing we'll be falling
All night long and
I'll do the kissin', you do the talkin'
Yeah, I'll do the kissin', you do the talkin'



The bluest skies don't seem so blue
And the stars seem to be a little dimmer too
Now that you're around, you put 'em all to shame
Let me break it down 'cause what I'm trying to say is

No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

Gotta whole new direction, it seems, these days
I used to rush off to work and get home late
But now I show up late and rush back home
My priorities are different, I can't leave you alone

No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

Girl, if you ever get to guessing if I'm thinking 'bout you
Just remember that

No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you, you, you
You, oh, you



[Verse 1]
I will never believe what they say
There is a strength in enduring
They never speak for themselves
We are disappearing

[Pre-Chorus]
You will be all that I seek in a twisted light
I would live inside you
Words will be all that I keep in an open space
They would live inside you

[Chorus]
We hold up to an idea
And we'll fight it, what we can't see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going 'til we can't hear dead air
We hold up to an idea
And we'll fight it, what we can't see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going 'til we can't hear dead air

[Post-Chorus]
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air

[Verse 2]
This is a call to your arms
To take on mind over matter
Replacing fist over fist
We are disappearing

[Pre-Chorus]
You will be all that I seek in a twisted light
I would live inside you
Words will be all that I keep in an open space
They would live inside you

[Chorus]
We hold up to an idea
And we'll fight it, what we can't see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going 'til we can't hear dead air
We hold up to an idea
And we'll fight it, what we can't see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going 'til we can't hear dead air

[Post-Chorus]
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hmmm, you trynna get some good fame ain't cha?
Hmmm, you trynna slang in tha rain ain't cha?
Hmmm, you trynna save for tha Range ain't cha?
Hmmm, you trynna perfect your aim ain't cha?
Hmmm, you trynna get a big chain ain't cha?
Hmmm, with the medallions and the rings ain't cha?
Hmmm, gon' getcha air force plane ain't cha?
Say what? So you can get that hood fame ain't cha?

[Verse 1 - Pusha T]
Through depair I trapse, baking pies, baking cake
Hustling them E's and that C's and that H
While you probably talking frantic on the tape
Niggas in the hood ain't trynna to hear "Man it was a mistake"
They'll call you a bitch, not a bandit at ya wake
Epitaph reading how much damage you could take
While I'm on the boat with ya bitch, salmon on the plate
I know why you liked her, the head, it was great
Loving these bezels sets, change with no space
86 karats, you know how much digging in the planet this could take?
Patent leather Bapes... (Uh, uh!) Closet like planet of the Bape!
Monkey see, monkey do, monkeys following in place
Like I'm living in an episode of Planet of the Apes
You're watching the evolution of one of rap's greats
You niggas trynna take my place? Never happen

[Hook]
Hmmm, you trynna get some good fame ain't cha?

[Verse 2 - Sandman]
Dig it, every time I do it, encore
Slide out the Lincoln with the suicide doors
Ma, and I'm blingin' like Baby with all that shit on
My block pop til all that shit gone
What? You pussies hardly eat
What you spend on a home is a gaudy piece
On the chest of a biz-oss, it's a must I fliz-oss
My dream team wrestle for cheese like Eric Bischoff
From the kickoff to tip off, I give off rays from the VVs
Ice glazed like lip gloss
Thinking they can see me, I beg to diff-arr
Look up in the skiz-eye, it the big dip-arr
(That's cold!) Its chilly in Philly, its that real
Nobody know karate, more bodies than Kill Bill
Somebody get beside me, Lord, will his blood spill
Like a waterfall, fuck around make me slaughter y'all

[Hook]
Hmmm, you trynna get some good fame ain't cha?
Hmmm, you trynna slang in tha rain ain't cha?
Hmmm, you trynna save for tha Range ain't cha?
Hmmm, you trynna perfect your aim ain't cha?
Hmmm, you trynna get a big chain ain't cha?

[Verse 3 - Malice]
Oh you just gon' take without asking ain't cha?
You just grabbin', you ain't earnin' for shit, that's too old-fashion
Look, tulip, I will never tuck a jewel up
Kindergarten did they not tap your knuckle with the ruler?
I'm the era of the Juice Crew, don't let that dookie noose you
1 and 1 is 2, its just as simple as Blue's Clues
The nine will get most of you, turn yourself around
For he who want to run up and earn himself a crown
Meanwhile study something nigga, this Gucci, Parker
From France where the kids sing Frere Jacques
If not there, I'm somewhere mixing vodkas
In a far off land, where they shake maracas and shit
Keep it moving like in kis of coke
You The Hunted motherfucker, and I'm Benicio
Not Tommy Lee, see we never involve the law
If it seems the walls are closing in, it's only ‘cause they are
Motherfucker

[Verse 4- Ab-Liva]
I'm a natural born hustler, I, the risk taker
I get it cross the border, the Alpha the Omega
My life, I scripted the paper posh like the wrist in the cradle
That hug the diamonds that kiss for you haters
Grimaldi, is so gaudy
But its just so picture-perfect as I lean in that six-forty-
Five CI, I'm on them blades likes T.I
The niggas hate to measure ‘cause they knee high
Still slingin' that P-I, E what I bring by
Me 50 cal, pretty desert up my sleeve, I
Still hugging that corner so tight it can't breathe, I
Can't let it go, ‘cause a nigga got to eat, I
Came to conquer the game, the flame and the powder
And the pot, stirred it crazy, I'm a lead-a
Still in the game, tipping the scale like Libra
You don't really want that halo over your Caesar! No!

(I know she wants to move it, that girl can't help herself)
(I know she wants to move it, that girl can't help herself)
(I know she wants to move it, that girl can't help herself)
(I know she wants to move it, that girl can't help herself)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I keeps that dirty money, I'm talkin' fast cash
I'm talkin' razor shaving, I'm talkin' duffle bags
I'm talkin' You can count it Papi, it's all there
I'm talkin' hooking up that Slumdog Millionaire
I like the fast girls, who like them fast cars
Who rather sell it to ya then ask for more tomorrow
I know those YSL platforms ain't coming cheap
And plus I like to show I gets it from the streets

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
I'm out here dressed like I belong on TV
Settle for less? Hell no, that wouldn't be me
Hey now, all eyes on me, hey now, I skipped the line for free
Bass loud how it's got to be, hey now, all eyes on me

[Verse 2: Malice]
I see your name in lights, your face on the big screen
Let's cruise, drop the top, you deserve to be seen
Rockin' them Prada goggles, you're my next top model
Your style like Jackie O, oh now just sit back and let 'em marvel
I know you see this paper, I bet you count my cash
Countless trips to Saks with her make her tote Birkin bags
[?] nicely served, let that quench your thirst
Damn right those bitches hate cause they just mad you had it first

[Hook]

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Jockin' my swag, I'll pop tags, you'll be borrowing
No drinks in here, y'all thirsty, we be swallowing
Don't matter where I go, them haters be following me
So hey now

[Verse 3: Malice]
I know what girls like, know whatchu looking for
Them tights is fittin' right, you hyped them up some more
You pulled that hair back, stick that ass out for them boys to see
You damn near broke your heel from posing, tryna catch a G
Gucci, Fendi, Louis - your man don't do that, do he?
Now take the stage, the floor is yours, come on, let's make a movie
Work that camera mama, rip that runway baby
Now pop your collar, see them dollar signs is why they hate me

[Hook]



[Intro - Pusha-T]
Yeah, yeah..
What y'all wanna do?
What y'all wanna do?
C-L, I-P, S-E, N-E-R-D
What y'all wanna do?

[Verse - Pusha-T]
My coke money's in cleaners
Give it a fresh rinse
Jap bitch wit the tech, first line of defense
Pullin' up in the Ac' black shit with dents
Test our aim, we'll be speaking your name in past tense
Dress have you stressed till all black the scheme
Chest poor formation when I'm wit my team
Stand on the back line, rope fit for kings
How we floss, high gloss, we living through your dreams
Death before dishonor, cut by katana
Play while I lay, bathhouse Tijuana
Getting fucked by Lana, hoes in the sauna
Like her ass though, but her head was the trauma
Arrogant for a reason, sex all season
Two chicks, one dick, the odds are uneven
Niggas die for treason, heart stop beating
Hang em from the lightpoles wintertime, when it's freezing
Take the safety off lock, forty cali' chrome cock
All I wanna hear, pows and pops
Send your last two breaths 'fore your breathin stop
Bodysnatch you, whether it's rhythm or ones
Bodysnatch you, whether grenade or guns
Yo to all of my rivals, hold you bitches liable
When it's time I'm pulling out my nine from the Bible

[Hook - Pusha-T& (Magnum)] (2x)
I'ma catch your body tonight (tonight)
Give a fuck about the blue light (blue light)
Like you can't get debate the rhythm (can't wait to get him)
I'ma snatch your body tonight (tonight)

[Verse - Magnum]
Yo, Hell Hath No Fury, look at my jewelry
Blew the fuck out like Jesus gave it to me
Virginia's where my spot be, NSX car keys
Don't try to take em, I'm twin Glock-ly
Eat you like broccoli, then spit the stems
Description, Liberace, fits the gems
Was six when I traveled, the young black Pharrell
Walk you out your crib wit your lips around the barrel
Niggas wanna murder me, dirty me
Jesus died and rose at the age of thirty-three
Resurrection bitch, my protection bitch
Your head's about to have the Devil's numbers etched in, bitch
There's that bitch Annie, with the eyes that sandy
Girl of the supplier's brother, named Manny
Glock many tecs so security could scan me
Hit of the year, I better get a street Grammy
It's hot in this back seat, slut bitch fan me
There's that nigga, dressed in Miami
The voice of Tammy Lucas means I'm gon shoot this heater
And mack entire crews like Reba
My nigga Q-Ball, got eighty rounds to do y'all
Got a "weight" problem, can't wait to get to y'all
A genie is blasphemous, anthraxous
And who makes money, cleaning money, through taxes?

[Hook]

[Verse - Malice]
You can catch me in the back of the club, wit a buzz
Wilding out frivolous, it's about ten of us
Cats they envy us, wanna bust, either them or us
What a rush when they make attempts to finish us
Can't diminish us, our plan too sinister
When it's all done and said, you in the need of ministers
I'm the nigga that you fear for wetting you up
Make you feel like everything's love and setting you up
We blown up, and these blocks got em sewn up
Niggas talking funny on my cell, hang the phone up
Chicks wit the blunts, pull the pump shotty outta your bunk
Body in a slump, either way, making em jump
We got pretty cars, key to the city ours
We the type to get a free lap dance, in titty bars
Y'all floss, nah, we flaunt like drugs ours
Sky's the limit, so we fly and touch stars
Fuck y'all, no good full of hate niggas
Rush up in your spot, where my where the cake niggas
Break niggas, wit the heat, penetrate niggas
And move it down south like my out of state niggas
Ill right? hit you wit two, now what it feel like?
Looking like some TV shit, but this is real life
Fuck, we got pies to slice, jewels to ice
Feel the wrath of this Clipse shit, lose your life

[Hook - repeat 4x]



[Verse 1 - Malice]
You'll never catch these fugitives, this high speed
With hoppin' water, see-thru blue on jet skis
They twist trees, bangin' they head to run my single
Mean while we minglin' with chicks that's bilingual
Haters be like we sick of them, niggas in the whip sippin' gin
Switchin' lanes without signalin'
But they watch they mouth, cause my dogs they ignorant
While I'm laid back, rockin' the Link, fuck what ya'll think
Stress-free, index finger mixing my drink
You see we hot like two 4-5th with gold clips
Ain't none of y'all fuckin' with this, it's hopeless
Malice on that raw Shawshank, cut your throat shit

[Hook x2 - Clipse]
This is for my thug hustlers, dealers and gun runners
To my niggas locked, holdin' it down in body numbers
Think of the Clipse with the whole clique in black Hummers
Stackin' them chips and let them tricks get nothing from us

[Verse 2 - Noreaga]
I'm wit' Kurupt, in L.A., you know, my main homie
Readin' books by thugs, it's like Monster Cody
Get on some N.O. shit, like what up woady
Hey yo, off top, I'm like Puff, just won't stop
I get drunk and hit them hoes with the Smirnoff cock
Neptunes lace the beat that'll rock your block
I'm movin' on like Mya and Silkk
We don't mix like Henny and milk
I got the cover and grill
Now, everybody a thug, look what I built
I keep it hot, while them sissy niggas been done chill
I let 'em live, you know I could've had them killed
Five thousand and one, stay laced by Troy
Fuck with Nore then you know that you some dumb boy
Me and Clipse got clips for ya'll faggots and boys
What!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kurupt]
I blaze rhymes, nine days it's like Vietnam
My nigga Nore run 'round wit' a Glock in his palm
I'm a specialist at this with, twist cock assist (what's that)
All your money homie, ain't nothin' funny homie
You gotta fat bitch, I bet she can eat a big fat dick with them big ass lips
Triangle the game, changin' the game
Sweet arrange, make all the hoes bounce
Neptunes, blaze an ounce
Now all the hoes strippin', all the niggas trippin'
D.P. sittin', sippin', hittin' switches
What you tryin' to do homie, tryin' touch me
Cock back and bust, screamin' mother fucker
Blaze up a sack, I wonder where the gangsters at
Where the thugs are at, where all the bustas and slugs are at
I'm a general, raw dog assassin homie
Assassin nigga, bitch nigga, be blastin' nigga
I'm a pimp, I'm a g, something you wanna be
Malice and Terrar said bust two to the head, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Pusha-T]
I spit that raw shit, ya'll niggas is tailor-made
Find Clipse and Nore, racin' the Palisades
Or in the hovercraft floatin' the Everglades
Whatever the setting, count on three renegades
In bandanas, remind you of Santana
Joints fully auto, shells out of bananas
This triangle's strong, these walls never be torn
Love is love, all our hearts are warm
Try to infiltrate, you feelin' more than the norm
The barrage of hollows hit hard like bridge storms
Even in the pristine, Chapel of the Sistine
I'm still prone to leave you glistening
I'll mouth to you what joy does this bring
And stagger away calm withdrawn and whistling
I speak in this vain so you know what lines to cross
You can start breathin' again, Terrar signin' off

[Hook x2]



[Pusha T talking]

[Hook: Pusha T]
I'm a champion, shorty I'm a champion
I been around the map, now I'm on my victory lap, hey hey
See, I'm a champion, shorty I'm a champion
While other niggas crashing em, hey I'm just steady mashing em
Tell em what you told me, tell em what you told me
Tell em what you told me, tell em what you told me
Tell em what you told me, tell em what you told me
Tell em what you told me, tell em what you told me

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
They say I'm shining dog, you see these diamonds dog
They say I'm shining so hard I like to blind em dog
You got a problem dog? Well you can bring it on
I got at least a 100 shots and you can get 'em all
Hey! I did it! I really did it!
I'm like the poster child for niggas that just get it, get it
I'm supposed to smile for my niggas who ain't here to live it
I'm putting money on they books so they can ball in prison
And feel the spirit of a boss, dual pipe exhaust
All we know is to floss
I'm cocaine Cassel and throwing bombs to Moss
My bitch keeps the newest and the latest
A street nigga, she know I'm the greatest, hey, hey
Hold up that Rosé, pouring half the bottle out
If you from where I'm from, you know why I'm showing out
Overcame the odds, so we overdue them cars
We done balled around the world
Now we reaching for the stars, hey, hey

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Malice]
If only I had gotten what I had deserved
Lord knows, I would've been done left this earth
Or either in somebody's jail, rotten, that's my word
If not yourselves, then you need to have them kids in church
Mistook my work for selling crack
You should've got more out of it then that
My Grandma would say "boy you backwards as the hat"
Rather in a trap, NFL draft pick or rap
Virginia's for hustlers, hustlers get it back
I thought that life was a bad bitch, bad car
Life is with your kids watching Madagascar
In the headrest of the H3 with crash bar
Rocking Play Cloths, every day's a catwalk

[Hook]

[Bridge]
[Pusha T]
Been there, done that, fell off, got back
Real nigga shit, only champions can talk that
Earn my respect, niggas hating cause they want that
Been to hell and back, only champions can walk that

[Malice]
Talk that, put yo money where ya mouth is
Tee off on the green, golf course is where the house is
A long way from pumping out housing projects
Investing in real estate, weighing out my prospects

[Hook]



[Hook: Pusha T]
I'm at your door, your eyes are like, "Why are you here?"
Judging by my steel I got something to do here
Give up the money or the angel cries two tears
Front of your crib sounding like Chinese New Year

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Mask on face, Glock in hand
I was in and out of homes like the Orkin Man
Never listen to my parents like an orphan man
Strong finger on the trigger like it's in dwarf's hands
Confiscate goodies like Repo Man Sam
Make nigga kick that can
Fall victim to the Klick Klack Klan
My vixen eat ya face like she Ms. Pac-Man
My wish her command, ugh
ADT's ain't stop me, simple like ABC's
Snip, cut, yank just as easy as 1-2-3, breaking and entry so elementary
Get what the hustlers get for tryna do what the hustlers do
Give up the cash 'fore I turn you Cookie Monster blue
And your man and them for tryna be hustlers too
Ernie and Bert, I bet them bullet holes burning and hurt

[Hook: Pusha T]
I'm at your door, your eyes are like, "Why are you here?"
Judging by my steel I got something to do here
Give up the money or the angel cries two tears
Front of your crib sounding like Chinese New Year

[Verse 2: Malice]
Let's play cops and robbers
And watch Heckler & Koch turn cops to martyrs
As well as niggas with plots to rob us
Try me, I'll turn this mothafucka into Shottas
With them 911's revvin'
Gunfire leave brethren remains like it's 9/11
And get the sounds of rounds dispensing
That clack up make 'em back up like it's invisible fencing
When I picture bits and pieces
Of bone chip and flesh, it tears me to pieces
Cooperate, escape is useless
Trust me I'm your friend, I will talk you through this
Trick or treat niggas with hoods want the goods
I feel like Robin Hood when I share it with my hoods
Don't forget, he who plays hero gets hit
Don't let the 9 mil riddle your wits, smarty pants

[Hook: Pusha T]
I'm at your door, your eyes are like, "Why are you here?"
Judging by my steel I got something to do here
Give up the money or the angel cries two tears
Front of your crib sounding like Chinese New Year

[Verse 3: Rosco P. Coldchain]
Sympathy? I feel none, when you hear that humming
Common sense'll tell you duck and get the fuck outta harm's way
Your dying will absolutely make my day
Why he had to go look cool, but he wasn't so he got betrayed
This is what I did to him, nozzle with a Sig to him
Hurried out his crib, before that took everything
Powder to pocket change, even the lint
Left the boy laying with his skin
If I didn't get you right you better hold your pistol tight
When we meet in the afterlife
Coldchain, I'm the black one that bleed
Rosco P, young G, I don't speak I just squeeze
97 P will make you drop to your knees
Before you know it you'll be floating to a better place, your soul feeling free
I'm young, black, and I just don't give a fuck
Big burner on my waist, drugs in the trunk
Sitting high in a truck, call me luck, come press me

[Hook: Pusha T]
I'm at your door, your eyes are like, "Why are you here?"
Judging by my steel I got something to do here
Give up the money or the angel cries two tears
Front of your crib sounding like Chinese New Year



[Verse 1: Malice]
Say dog, let's not get involved
You don't want to tango, I'll dress you in a halo
Cock the gauge, polka dot your braids
Face you with a chrome 4 that'll lock your legs
And you can't move, I roll big and I can't lose
They watch so hard, ain't nothing I do that ain't news
Carry it like I'm a stranger to the game
I cut short any whisper that endanger my name
I hold toasts on both coasts, not for no joke
I'm known in the streets on the account I know coke
And we got word that the cops watch us
But that don't stop us, we maneuver and move a little more cautious
I hate to think that the dope game is my callin'
Cause it got us singing lullabies to our fallen:
"Good night friend, until we meet again
But for now in your name, we re-up and eat again"
I never front, like I'm something I'm not
But being broke, well that's just something I'm not
Y'all talk with hatred, but I live off that
And I lived off cocaine, way 'fore I lived off rap
Feel me, friend, if they could they'd kill me, friend
Cause I weigh too much, learned not to say too much
They couldn't take me in the CL, that's way too much
And I'm too gone, y'all niggas can talk on

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
They call me Mr. Please-believe-it, believe it, please
I put the pump in your mouth and help you breath with ease
This guy's in a hurry, ma, I can't even fuck with you
If you ain't in the itinerary
I don't know where dudes is buying their jewelry
Why's your ice cream, like it's made by Ben & Jerry?
Y'all the type of players that be getting 2-day contracts
E-mail snitch, got Ds in your 2-way contacts
I'm in the club sippin' on that new 'Ze cognac
In the number 9 Jordans, with the deuce trey on back
The street family so cool, we could pull bitches
Even if it was July, and we had on Woolrich's
I got them teflons to shove in the 4
That have undercovers and po' recovering slow
The government know: the kid been loving the dough
Since I was moving white off the curb like shoveling snow

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I keep the streets so numb they call me "Novocaine"
I turn over 'caine over and over again
Hell, so much clientele, I could lose it all today
Be back the next day, still up in the same way
As I left ya, all in 3 gestures: down up and aim
I can define death better than Webster, wet ya
Now bless ya, and off to my next venture
Blocks so white, June look like December
Wintertime: snow everywhere, flow everywhere
So much dough I fly my hoes everywhere
Ask him, Pusha T (Push-a-Ton)
Push a ton of that shit that makes ya nose run [Sniffle]
Yes I'm holding, whether it's heat or coke in
In the door panel of my 4-wheel motion
Ain't jokin', but I laugh how other flows convince you
It's money, it's funny, it's Comedy Central
Mine's mental, others is made up stencil
When I'm on vacation, my babies ride in a rental
I'm livid -- they act as if I don't live it
Saran wrap Vaseline, so they can't sniff it
Yves St. Laurent knitted, shorts bermuda
You would think they was Pucci if you overlooked Medusa

[Hook: Pharrell]
Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!
Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu!
Cot' damn!

[Verse 1: Malice]
Uh, they just can't understand or fathom my demeanor
Unapproachable appearance to how I pack the ninas
Out of two, Clipse they say Malice the meanest
Got love for guns and caine, let nothin' come between us
You mistook me for a rapper, huh
Well that makes me an actor, cause I would rather clap a gun
And buck on them niggas who hate
Who wanna be in my shoes, live my life, but can't carry my weight
I understand that the envy is part of the game
But make no mistake, you and I, we are not the same
Naw, bitch, I'm liable to splatter ya shit
Light up ya world, 'til you start to stagger and shit
Watch how them hollows straight rattle ya shit
And I leave it to y'all, to freestyle and battle and shit
That's not me, I'm more at home wit the chrome
Or at play wit the yay, moving 12 for a zone, I'm gone

[Hook: Pharrell]
Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!
Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu!
Cot' damn!

[Verse 2: Ab-Liva]
God damn, when that white hits the pan and
Comes back hard, I can account for every gram and
The streets molded the man I am
The pimp, the hustler, the crook, the killer, go-rilla
Traits of a blow dealer, cost my fame
I hustle, I'm rich, blow scrilla
I'm the torch that, carry the game
The flame I throw, crack change came from blow
Push the O's, six lay close
Hug the streets, I hug the beat, change flows
Thug the streets, my love is deep, my pain shows
My hearts on a sleeve-a
Nigga that they gave they soul and hearts to mistreat you
Nigga told, they breaking my heart on the streets so
Watch the phonies, watch ya homies
We pop-pop, DROP you homey

[Hook: Pharrell]
Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!
Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu!
Cot' damn!

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
They call me Pusha for one reason
Cause I keep that sniff all seasons
Whether the price is up or down
I keep a mound to pitch from, you don't have to shop around
When it come to that money, I get stealth
Three guns is fortune, and I don't mind sharing my wealth
Dog, I know about life
I been around the world thrice times, I mean what I say
From that Panama sun, to France's Champs-Élysées
Grind so deep-rooted, I can't turn away
To sell base is now somewhat therapeutic
Hear what I say, please don't confuse it
My verses heal, like Curt Mayfield's music
(I'm your pusha!), damn right
I treat ya nose to hook ya
And only pull back to cook ya, partner

[Hook: Pharrell]
Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!
Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu!
Cot' damn!

[Verse 4: Roscoe P. Coldchain]
I be damned if I die of starvation, things is fucked up as is
So I bangs my cabbage; do you not know the most effective
Way of gettin' money, pull yo gun - rapidly
And watch you see the situation be corrected
Lord Heavens, why must I live so devilish
They say whatcha do comes back on you two times
I shoulda been died, but I'm still walking around wit two nines
Who wants to be a millionaire, me, and you ain't got no more life lines
You a snitch nigga fighting crime, go ahead and tell the police
Cause every move you make, I'mma throw a slug
And hope you choke blood, nigga, on every breath you take
Not to be broke, cause Coldchain fate witness
Naturally spitting from me, human gat, field to the limit
Head to diminish, loud niggas talking gibberish
Grind beef, I deliver it, with complimentary service, for certain
Live in the living room, searching to hurting you

[Hook: Pharrell]
Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!
Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu!
Cot' damn!

Oh God, I need counseling
How many chicks do I got? I'm still counting
Man, I need counseling

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Hey! I think I got a problem problem
And I need an open ear to try to solve 'em
Having a hard time picking out my darling
So until then I guess I juggle all 'em
Nah, I ain't gonna beg my pardon
'Cause I don't shop for none ya'll bitches at Arden
B, sippin' on a sweet as a Chardonnay
I balls, I don't bargain, see
I used to be all about a fat ass
Then I found a cutie with a flat ass
Good head, nice smile but her flat ass
Two out of three, shit, I couldn't let that pass
Doc, what you gon' about this?
'Cause I ain't got a clue about this
I'm use to getting what I want, when I want, where I want, how I want
Then them girls holler "You ain't shit!"

[Hook: Pharrell]
Look at that ass just bouncing
Oh God, I need counseling

So many chicks, I can't pick a favorite
My shrink even say my behavior's sick
The hips to how shawty lick her lips
Just a few thoughts that come to mind as a reminisce
Temptation always been my nemesis
A few sips then take her back to my premises
Innocence lost once again
How can we be more than friends?
Baby don't be mad, think back of the fun that we had
The love we share is so cheap like a E-Class
You ain't alone, I too am a sleaze bag
I guess I need Celebrity Rehab because
Ain't no Real Chance at Love
All my wrongdoings forbid me to trust
Oh God, forgive me for lust
Don't let another heart get crushed, come on

[Hook: Pharrell]
Look at that ass just bouncing
Oh God, I need counseling
Images in my head steady hounding
Oh God, I need counseling
You don't want to bring your chicks around him
Oh God, I need counseling
How many chicks do I got? I'm still counting
Man, I need counseling

[Bridge: Nicole]
Caught, you sneaking in the doorway late last night
But I ain't got the will to try and fight
These bitches steady hounding
Think you better go to counseling
Tame the beast you keep inside

[Verse 3: Pusha T + Malice]
Yo, maybe I'm crazy, maybe, just maybe
It's hard finding time, can't tell me I'm lazy
The way my phone ring may seem a bit shady
I'm 'bout my cash money, ma, maybe it's baby
How you persuade me via email?
Fresh out the shower, sending pics from your cell
Wishing I was there taking a flick myself
And then hit delete, I can't afford to leave a trail

[Hook: Pharrell]
Look at that ass just bouncing
Oh God, I need counseling
Images in my head steady hounding
Oh God, I need counseling
You don't want to bring your chicks around him
Oh God, I need counseling
How many chicks do I got? I'm still counting
Man, I need counseling



[Pusha T]
Yo wattup ma'
I got a pocket full of stinky's lets go spend these right quick

[Girl]
Whats that?

[Hook - Pusha T]
All my fly bitches like (dirty money, dirty money)
All my stripper bitches like (dirty money, dirty money)
All my college hoes like (dirty money, dirty money)
Don't it spend so right? (dirty money, dirty money)
Now lets go shopping, lets go chill
Let's go buy them new Louboutin heels
Ass in La Perla, ears full of pearls
Damn dirty money know how to treat the girls

[Verse 1- Pusha T]
Give a little - take a little, my check the dealy
Most niggas is will-not's, you're dealing with a willy
3-D faces on them crisp new billies
Got Benji lookin all googley-eyed and silly
The glitter chill got ya mind seein milli-mill's
I'm 7 figure, the bigger, your thoughts are literal
See I don't blame ya, cashmeres that you feels
Picturing the fortune, you just tryna spin the wheel
Brain like Teri, face like Eva
I ain't forgettin them other Housewive's neither
Two-seaters, back in the trunk, 2 feevas
We stayin up till 2 a.m.to watch Cheaters
As long as I'm nice with the flame and the flass
I don't mind keepin you up on them must-have's
Pito pumps, Gucci slouch bags
Now tell me, is that dirty money really that bad?

[Hook]

[Verse 2- Malice]
We could trick tuiton, you could be the vixen
You could front for ya girlfriends, I ain't trippin'
You done got you a rapper, I see ya vision
And one of the best too, that's ambition
You could tell me 'bout ya day, I pretend I listen
And you ain't gotta love me, just be convincin'
I don't ask much, some ashes on the cuff
And that silver bullet, automatic or the clutch
Nah mama hush, you ain't even gotta speak
Jus put it on ya charge, check makes ya feet
Compliments of me, take the bitter with the sweet
And we can get this money like its falling outta tree
Come spend a dollar, yea, bathe in it, walla
17-5 for the low, tell 'em "Holla"
Love you in Escada, Jimmy Choo, Prada
Snow White ya life, hows that for starters?

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Pusha T]
To my fly ghetto bitches with their hair-shop-talk
Braggin to their hair-dresser 'bout that shit he bought
To my South Beach bitches with that sassy walk
Who ain't tryna hear nuttin if you don't ride Porsche
To my get-money niggas gettin paper fa' sho
Trickin' grands up in Louis for the love of the sport
I tell ya, get money money, take money money, uh
Dope money money is great money money, what

[Verse 4- Malice]
Before I'mma bicker with ya, ma, I'mma switch ya
I fly 'em in quick, I fly 'em out even quicker
By no means, am I in love with a stripper
You understand that then you fit in the glass slipper
Travelin' broads, sittin' in G-4's
Changin' the weather, when it rains, it pours
And the crib is ajoined with French doors
You rock with ya boy then anything is yours

[Hook]



[Hook: Pusha T]
Hey doorman, tell em line up the Cris
I put my money on the roof and crush this bitch
You niggas keep waving them wrists
I put my money on the roof and crush this bitch
Ye ain't got money like this
I put my money on the roof and crush this bitch
So scream it if ya ambition fit
I put my money on the roof and crush this bitch
(Sing it niggas)
You ain't got money like this
Paper plates on a brand new Six
I just taught my young boys how to mix
You ain't seen paper like this, nigga

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Every All-Star, every Cancun
Every holiday South Beach in full bloom
Thousand dollar suites white sheets, white rooms
I've got a bright future neck like a full moon
Buy what we want, spend what they want
Young, rich, hot nigga, everything she wants
Triple beams scales got me under deep spells
Kiss my forehead, momma knows I mean well
Cocaine bought me everything I ever had
And I ain't never been scared to spend my very last
Cause I can get it back, watch me get it back
Last 2 or 10 bricks, shit I'm cooking that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Malice]
My life's too real to be a PSA
The million in the ceiling's for a rainy day
I cut it, then whip her like she Annie Mae
Praise God I escaped by his amazing grace
Nah, never was I saving Face
Some family ties are impossible to break
The almighty judge, only he can save me
Don't cry for us now, just pray for our babies
Mercedes 5 with the open roof
Miami Hot Rods in the ocean view
The tell-tale signs that expose the truth
Lil Willy Rat King, this one's for you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Malice]
We get it in a flash like paparazzi
Cars, crib, everything big body
Big charm, hanging from my big chain
Swing side to side, feeling like I'm T-Pain
Pull up to the crib, bitch thinks she's seeing thangs
Make a hundred stacks, blow it like it's pocket change

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
If the good die young, than the greats go to jail
I miss my Tony, hope you snitches burn in hell
Kiss and tell with sales on us ballers
All because them two doors coming with big spoilers
All because them bitches is acting like they jaw-less
And we don't count money, we weigh it like fish orders

[Hook]

[Outro: Pusha T]
Doorman!



[Pusha T]
Yes sir..

[Hook 2X's]
Don't let 'cha ego trick yo ass
Cause this motherfuckin' tech will get yo ass
(Pharrell)
"Yes, the semi-automatic tech is know to jam..."
But if it don't, that's yo ass my man

[Verse 1: Malice]
I got guns cause they got guns
I get cash they get none
So I'm sure you see where that leaves me
In the streets with two heats, both one within my reach
I speak slow, let 'em understand my speech
When I say, "Get low, these hold ten shots each
Please, don't move too fast, I scared of y'all niggas and my nerves is bad!"
So sad, but I won't think twice
We rich, we get the best judicial advice
Threaten my life with them words that they ut-ter-in'
Adrenaline pump, my heart start to flut-ter-in'
Continuous dump, that tech gets to stut-ter-in'
Left in the slump, mother and sister cud-dle-in'
And for what, cause you ego-trippin'
If that thing jam, it's divine intervention
Click!

[Hook]
Don't let 'cha ego trick yo ass
Cause this motherfuckin' tech will get yo ass
(Pharrell)
"Yes, the semi-automatic tech is know to jam..."
But if it don't, that's yo ass my man

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Even if it's talk cheap (Say what...)
You know I can't sleep on his word
Had to show him that I heard (Let's go...)
All that duct-tape-tie-up talk put in reverse
Now it's him who's in a bind on the account of his words (Yeah, you know
It...)
Yeah, they talk 'bout this and that (That...)
Got it fucked up, like I'm all 'bout rap (Rap...)
Word is I'm loaded, they want a piece of that
I respond with four words, "Rat-tat-tat-tat" (In yo ass...)
Now, rap about that
I carry a human heat box, to make ya heartbeat stop (Stop...)
Some say Pusha's the coldest
Money is my morals, other than that, I'm soulless
Refuse to wake up zeroless and O-less
Carry that shit that blow your arm out your shoulders (Bla-oww...)
Techs don't come with holsters, I'm a menace boy (Don't forget, motherfucker)

[Hook]
Don't let 'cha ego trick yo ass
Cause this motherfuckin' tech will get yo ass
(Pharrell)
"Yes, the semi-automatic tech is know to jam..."
But if it don't, that's yo ass my man

[Pharrell]
Yo..
You niggas ain't fuckin' wit' us..
This is the real..
You niggas ain't fuckin' - wit' us..
This is the real..
You niggas ain't fuckin' wit' us..
This is the real..
You niggas ain't fuckin' - wit' us..
This is the real..
Bitch..



[Verse: Fam-Lay]
It ain't nothin' y'all can teach me
I been locked up more times than Sweet Pea
See I'm from Norfolk here's a coffin if ya slee-py
Turn ya children into orphans tryna sneak me
Or tryna creep me, the realest shit I ever spoke
So I'ma spit it when I finish, I'mma slit my throat
This shit is like 211 mixed wit coke
Leave you spinning like the tennis balls in ya spoke, nigga
Dark secrets, man I won't lie
They came to the light a man is gon' die
All hope is lost and FamLay's gon' fry
Cause I did shit the average man just won't try
Like what? War against an army wit a hand gun
I'm FamLay, and when my fucking chance come
I'm running wit it, on e'ry song I'm coming wit' it
See some you think you can take from me, then come and get it
See I'm from Huntersville, e'ry thang we done is real
My niggas come in here, my niggas come to kill
And I dare y'all to try to dis us
See you in the streets it ain't nothing discuss
Maaan, we gon' stomp yo ass dead in the ground
FEW WEEKS, couple bodies wit no head'll be found, nigga
Cut off ya wrists, and they feet no prints (Gangsta)
Now I'm in the Six, (Gangsta) wit the heat no tints, you see me boy

[Outro: Pharrell]
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
Niggas, bang, bang, bitches, bang, bang
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
Niggas, bang, bang, bitches, bang, bang



[Intro - Pharrell]
Yo, we lovin' this
I got it baby
Ain't nothin' but a par-ar-ty
On my laced out chicks, par-ty
All my niggas in the six, par-ty
Clipse comin' wit' the hits, par-ty

[Verse 1 - Pusha-T]
Yo, the flow echo, grab a ho, won't let go
Chick shake her ass, calypso, I'm drinkin' on the world
Sip slow, techno scene, laser beam
My team up, stand out like indigo dreams
In the club, bitches starin', dress, Donna Karan
They inch a bit close to see the links we wearin'
The jealous cats fill the room, but that's they doom
Because if the beef get set (PW: We cause a typhoon)
Yeah, what you here for, you better prepare for
The background cause your presence no one'll care
For the automatic, retaliate if it's static
Stagger when I walk, let my emeralds talk
Pusha's status, quote unquote top, never drop
While the competition pleads and begs for us to stop
The interlock, stack like stock, style I got
Gonna make the world build off me like Tetris blocks, yo

[Hook - Pharrell]
All I wanna do is drink on the world
Layin' on the beach, takin' sips wit' my girl
Here they come tryna trouble me
I just giggle cause I know they don't see
Nor can they hear so they need to explain
It's piece on pieces, that's simple and plain
This is our ode to the galaxy
Niggas in the wrong if you feel like me

[Verse 2 - Malice]
Do you not know what the Clipse is
Malicious, M.C. type relentless
Why risk going against this, senseless
You in the realm where your team is defenseless
Players we ball, you in the benches
Full of clips, underground wit' extensions
You thought the camp had love, we show none like a shogun
Malice murderin' MCs, except wit' no gun
The slow gun, beat'll live fast, die young
We from where they strike in the flash, like Cy Young
How you come where you ain't welcome puzzlin'
Take us more sips to cliss, we guzzlin'
Got me wonderin', how can you live wit' yourself
Move a detective, similar to the 'self
Drama, you want drama, we do drama
The prize package, we blow like Unibomber

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Malice]
It's a fine line, between the have and the ain't got
Mad cause you ain't hot, in fact, far from it
Watchin' you plummet, we reside at the summit
Full of clips, run this, ridiculous
Why you makin' me laugh, the Clipse
In an E-class, tap the wine glass at the lip
Then on behalf of the clique, take a sip
Remember how we used to be like, now it be like, whatever
Malice and Terrar, of the bad double header

[Pusha-T]
It's the congruent, symmetrical bomb unit
Opposition fate, end up in found unit
Sync wit' the flow, hell no, we fine tunin'
And make the lie, kiss while you break your spine to it
Talkin' to make you feel me walkin' without a worry
Blaze up the spot, watch the whole crowd hurry
Magnetic, do you like a tractor, pathetic
Fully clips, M.O., yo, ready to set hit

[Hook x2 w/ ad-libs]

[Outro - Pharrell]
Par-ty..
Ain't nothin' but a Clipse par-ty
All my niggas in the six, par-ty
On my laced out chicks, par-ty



[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Follow the leader, exhaust pipes and breathers
The flash from the barrel turns bullies to believers
The time of a life make the bitches wanna keep ya
This is my reality, want it? Well let me teach ya
Follow my footsteps through tragedy and triumph
Through flows give you mein kämpf
Kilos consigned 'em, do as I say like Simon
And you too will diamond blind hun
I'm on my Dylan, Dillinger flow just killing ya
You wonder why the real ain't feeling ya, you're frauding
I Mason jar Martin Margiela them O's together
Since Hov was name dropping Charles Jourdan
I kept them nodding, snorting
Slobbing, barfing, and bought cars off them
The realest rapper that's unwrapping got them
If you can fit these shoes than walk them
I parked them

[Hook: Kobe]
I could have been a goner but I had to save my soul
I'm out here chasing my dreams, looking for a place to go
Trying to get up out the ghetto, come follow with my footsteps
Put down the heavy metal and follow in my footsteps
Cause if you don't, it might be danger

[Verse 2: Malice]
It's not for you to do what I do, rather do what I say
These footsteps could lead you astray
Lead you to the cell or lead you to a grave
Either way, you might never see the light of day
Don't let my wrongs give you the right of way
To emulate my past escaping the law's grasp
Told you the truth, yet who was I to brag?
Especially seeing how Kimani finds it hard to laugh
I miss my homie by she's missing her dad
It weighs on my conscience and I hate conscious rap
Apart from that, I wish to see you succeed
So I speak to my people in spirit of chuck D
You behind the glass, trust me, it cut deep
And the words to every verse haunted me in my sleep
So now what you see is Malice's contradiction
He who has ears, I hope you're listening, come on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Malice]
Follow me like Twitter nigga, you can check the timeline
I'm the quiet one but my intellect is Einstein
I'm so unnerved by the shit that I've observed
Just looking at you coons got a nigga lost for words
Verge of insanity, I'm at my crossroads
Shame on the birds that led em like lost souls
We got it wholesale, we move it like Cosco's
Mercy on the court left us standing here heart broke

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
I taught you how to cut it, cook it on hot stove
I taught you how to share them when fucking with hot hoes
I taught you how to rock right shit up on your toes
I taught you how to smile for the camera when heartbroke
I've been the inspiration for all you industry dick tasters
To your local dream chaser I am King Push
I set the stage for all these triple beam hooks
I weighed mountains while them niggas just sang hooks (yuugh)

[Bridge: Kobe]
Oh, oh, oh, your mama said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, your grandmama said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, your baby sister said
Oh, oh, oh, your nigga said
Oh, oh, oh, now your whole block said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, your old teacher said
Oh, oh, oh, your misses said
Oh, oh, oh, your preacher said, yeah

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Pusha T]
With every line written, and all I have given
Music’s been nothing more than a self-made prison
I’ve taken inmate losses at the hands of this one
My pen’s been the poison to family and friendships
Now it’s time to mend shit, time to bring closure to
The clear conscience of Pusha is long overdue
Thinking to myself what can I be owing you?
They only tell you you great when they're reminiscing over you
Before I Trouble T-Roy, it’s just a d-boy
Let me play the role of a Common on his b-boy
Speaking my truth in rhyme, no matter how bland it is
A heavy heart lightened, that’s just what my ransom is
All apologies, I bear the cross, I wear the blame
We in the same group but I don’t share my brother’s pain
Not to confuse, our sentiments are all the same
I just don’t feel nothing, I’m numbed by the will to gain
Same thing brought tears to innocents
I turned away and didn’t even flinch, yuugh!
The music drove me crazy looked up and lost the first bitch
I ever wanted to have my babies
Nowadays she can’t even face me, I’m sorry for the heartbreak
I promised you forever my lady, Jodeci baby
Pompous motherfucker, just look what them jewels made me
I’m only finding comfort in knowing you can’t replace me
What a thing to say, but what am I to do
I’m role-playing a conscious nigga and true is true
Cocaine aside, all of the bloggers behooved
My critics finally have a verse of mine to jerk off to
I own you all

[Verse 2: Malice]
This is where the buck stop, here's where I draw the line
I touch the hem, God's work is so divine
I've seen the error of my ways over time
Never to return, Malicious has been refined
Like wine, with time I get better
Napa Valley vintage, my flow is fermented
Now drink of me, as if I bought the bar
Run to these words, as if there's no tomorrow
Never mind my car, careful what you wish for
Behind every curtain the devil and his pitchfork
Jealousy, I ask thee: What is this for?
How was I to know I was happy being piss-poor?
No, whore, that's not love, we was fucking
I was in search of a chickenhead, you was clucking
And I was lusting, we were both out of order
I should've known better as I'm reminded of my daughter
Am I my brother's keeper or for himself every man?
I have been your reaper, there's blood on my hands
Accept me as your keeper, there's been a change of plans
Careful what you speak of, I've come to understand, preach

[Outro: Pusha T]
What else you want from us, huh?!
What more can you ask?
We've given you everything
We lost life, we lost love
We lost family behind this shit
This shit you call music, we call this shit life
We gave you proof, they ain't give you shit!
We gave you truth
Do I entertain you motherfucka?!
Well dance then bitch!

Til' the casket drop
Til' the casket drop
Til' the casket drop
Til' the casket drop
Til' the casket drop
Til' the casket drop
Til' the casket drop
Til' the lord say stop



[Intro]
Gimme somethin' to roll
Somethin' gangstafied
Gimme somethin' to roll
Somethin' gangstafied
Gimme somethin' to roll
Somethin' gangstafied
Hey hey Star Trak, Star Trak
Now let's smoke and ride

[Bridge: Pharrell]
Oh girl ya taste is
Sweet like mornin' dew
I would go crazy girl
If I couldn't have none of you
I said ya from Jamaica
Straight outta my Mercedes trunk
You make me wanna roll ya up
And then you make my body slump

[Hook: Pharrell]
Which make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
Make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I only love her on occasions
Keep my heart racin'
Love to take her on vacations
Where the time zone changes and money exchanges
The speed is in kilometers on the dials of the ranges
Far away with my Jamacian sexy everyday is like a holiday
The cheeba got me in a slum sleeper
But when I try to leave her I just find out that it's cheaper to keep her
Plus she keep my thoughts deeper, really zonin'
Like my Cali homies 6-4 rollin'
Or them Deroit 'Lacs trimmed in golden
Or my Texas family 150 white strollin'
Damn, I was caught up in the Matrix
But not Keanu Reaves, as she rolls in bamboo leaves
I think a way to ship off these piano keys
Since the traffic in a gangsta lean

[Hook: Pharrell]
Which make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
Make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)

[Verse 2: Malice]
If you put me where I need to be
Twist you anytime I feel the need
Love ya touch and how you set my mind at ease
In Virginia where you kept me motionless
From that point on I knew I could never get over this
Now they wanna see us broke up
'Cuz I'm lovesick, got me all choked up
Look, you keep my head in the clouds mami ,'till I can't breathe
And next to that heat seeker you my main squeeze
Plus I get twistin' didn't even spend my money on
Now either I'm a fool or you really must got me gone
You got me open these days I must admit
Body numbed up and in a slump like I been hit
But luckily it's just the green got me leavin' smoke streams
And blowin' smoke rings as I flee from the scene
Gangsta leanin' in a 850 beamin'
I'm like K-Ci and Jo-Jo, love you got me fiendin'

[Bridge: Pharrell]
Oh girl ya taste is
Sweet like mornin' dew
I would go crazy girl
If I couldn't have none of you
I said ya from Jamaica
Straight outta my Mercedes trunk
You make me wanna roll ya up
And then you make my body slump

[Hook: Pharrell]
Which make a nigga have a gangsta lean

You make a nigga have a gangsta lean

You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Her sex so sticky, I'm talkin' real icky
Have me gone and twisty
Make my other women miss me
Just by the way she kiss me
Hold her wit the index and thumb tippys
Ma I'm so trippy
Hard to hold back, scent so sweet
Got to Cognac and honey wrap her this ain't drink
From Taiwanese to Amsterdam greeny green
To hydroponic that make a weak stomach vomit

[Verse 4: Malice]
Listen, at times you hinder my vision
Blinded by ya love and you got the room spinnin'
It's not jealousy the reason why I keep you hidden
Hell, I hit you then I pass you to my man like I do my women
I know just what I'm investin' in
I done traded currency wit the Mexicans
In Texas just so we could get affectionate
Your complexion lime green wit red specks in it
I love you

[Hook: Pharrell]
Which make a nigga have a gangsta lean

Hey hey Star Trak, Star Trak
Now let's smoke and ride



[Hook]
I got caught dealin, at the age of one-five
Had all my bitches stealin, just tryin to survive
And it was business as usual if one of mine had to die
Cause fuck that yo, I gotta make sure my dough multiply

[Verse 1: Pusha-T]
Crimes I commit heinous, y'all niggas is brainless
You tied up at gun point, flinch, make you famous
Blow make me live aimless, my gun stainless
Aim for your temple, hope you die painless
Illest shit we wore those, marked money we tore those
My whole team channelin coke through urban portholes
You livin like mere mortals, your block's foreclosed
We forty deep on in the street, and fuckin your hoes
Seen your man club bathroom soft stuff heron
Come out, loud talkin and shit, claimin he Don
Hope he know when he step outside, baby it's on
Watch my guns illuminate the sky like Vietnam
My confidence shared by all conglomerates
Everyone in my circle is dominant
We live prominent, your world we bombin it
Stuck in the pen? Walk the shit in
Kamikaze it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Eight-fifty navy blue, kill like a Laker do
Twenty inch chrome shit, who must I say to you
Watch what your lady do
We stoned the fuck out
Not just your car nigga, chrome ya truck out
Calico plastic, twin to match it
Ice white like some Star Wars space gun
Though, that ain't how they come my friend make 'em
Sleek wit 'em like in L.A. nigga, love is Daytons
They talk shit you nigga where it hits the procedure
I got rats that miss the sight of food, quick to swiss cheese ya
Actually they want the cheeba I'm the owner and leader
Yo my clip's my bitch, I own her and beat her
Huh, shit, dick missile tomahawk
One thing I love is sex discussions and armor talk
Who got all the CEOs disputin?
And my Clipse niggas fussin and shootin?
Yo, it's that same nigga

[Hook]

[Bridge]
It was.. make money money take money money what?
Make money money take money money what?
Make money money take money money what?
Make money money take money money money

[Verse 3: Malice]
You ain't never seen it like this
Ices this priceless, pullin heist-es
One wrong move, they lifeless
Thug shit, bullets and clips and pwice this
Where I come from niggas shoot guns and dices
What the price is, scratch that we don't ask that
We blast that gat in yo mouth, where the cash at?
That's how I roll, drugs get sold but never hold shit
Malice face two-five to life, but never told shit
It's like that, love for my clique, go ahead and light that
When shorty lick with no handjob and never bite that
Day in the life, ain't nothin nice how I hit 'em up
Hands high get 'em up, cash tried lit 'em up
Regret that? Countin my stack I had to wet that
Hog tied, telephone cords, speak to the lord
And while the cops untyin' you, my whole team eyein' you
Cause even if you talk in your sleep my heat fryin' you

[Hook] - repeat 3X



[Intro: Pharrell & (Pusha T)]
Yo, I go by the name (I'm yo' pusha)
Of Pharrell, from the Neptunes
And I just wanna let y'all know (I'm yo' pusha)
The world, is about to feel something (I'm yo pusha)
That they've never felt before, c'mon

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whipped un-whipped, it’s soft or hard
I'm the neighborhood pusha
Call me Subwoofer, cause I pump base like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy cous
Ball 'til you fall, cause you could duck to the Feddy Govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Benz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm trying to show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting, be damned if I'm hurting
Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland
Platinum on the block with consistent hits
While Pharrell keep talking this music shit

[Hook: Pharrell]
Grindin'...
Grindin', grindin'
Grindin', grindin'
Huh-huh

[Verse 2: Malice]
Patty cake, patty cake, I'm the baker's man
I bake them cakes as fast as I can
And you can tell by how my bread stack up
Then disguise it as rap so the feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick, topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got wholes for a dozen
Even eleven-5, if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help
'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills
And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me
I'm just grinding man, y'all never mind me

[Hook: Pharrell]
Grindin'...
Grindin', grindin'
Grindin', grindin'
Huh-huh

[Post-Hook: Clipse & (Pharrell)]
Grindin' (whoa)
When you know what I keep in the lining (whoa)
Niggas better stay in line when (whoa)
You see a nigga like me shinin' (grinding!)
Grindin' (whoa)
When you know what I keep in a lining (whoa)
Niggas better stay in line when (whoa)
You see a nigga like me shinin' (grinding!)

[Verse 3: Malice]
My grind's 'bout family, never been about fame
From days I wasn't able, there was always 'caine
Four and a half will get you in the game
Anything less is just a goddamn shame
Guess the weight, my watch got blue chips in the face
Glock with two tips whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake
I'm grindin'

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
I move 'caine like a cripple
Balance weight through the hood, kids call me Mr. Sniffles
Other hand on my nickel
Plated whistle, one eye closed I'll hit you
As if I was Slick Rick my aim is still an issue
Lose your soul in, whichever palm I'm holdin'
One'll leave you frozen, the other, noddin' and dozin'
I'm grindin' Jack

[Hook: Pharrell]
Grindin'...
Grindin', grindin'
Grindin', grindin'
Huh-huh

[Post-Hook: Clipse & (Pharrell)]
Grindin' (whoa)
When you know what I keep in the lining (whoa)
Niggas better stay in line when (whoa)
You see a nigga like me shinin' (grinding!)
Grindin' (whoa)
When you know what I keep in a lining (whoa)
Niggas better stay in line, when (whoa)
You see a nigga like me shinin' (grinding!)

[Hook:  Clipse]
What's the size of them rims on that car nigga?!

(Grindin!) whatcha game be like?
(Grindin!) whatcha chain be like?
(Grindin!) so whatcha name be like?
Ma, it don't get more ghetto than this

[Verse 1: Noreaga]
See I'm grimey-minded, you've been blinded
Lookin for a beat like mine you can't find it
You hear the Clipse and N.O.R.E. gotta rewind it (*BEEP BEEP*)
Nowadays you get on that run and get finded
You know I got guns, why you actin like my daughters?
You know I got sons
Nah, we won't speak fam, aiming atchya collar bone
Hitchya in ya cheek fam

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
From ghetto to ghetto to backyard to yard
I sell it whip on whip, it's off the hard
Stand on that table, nigga, spit that Cris, nigga
Throw that chair, make em recognize this: raw
Playa looka here, I'm great in the kitchen like Corning cookware
Uncle Jemima, with my braids wrapped
And 3-minute recipes for cookin flapjacks
Coke priced through the roof, SL flew the coop
My niece askin how my rims bigger than a hoola-hoop
Cuzzo, I make the block holla, take it back to childhood
How the scale teeter-totter, as I evolve
Weight grew heavy, it was kinda like my buddy just fell off the see-saw
Bricks in the muffler, Mack-11 touch ya
Virgina's hustler, I'm here motherfucker

[Hook:  Clipse & Birdman]
What's the size of them rims on that car nigga?!
Can they see that chain from a far nigga?!

(Grindin!) whatcha chain be like? (MONEY!!)
(Grindin!) so whatcha name be like? (STUNNA)
Ma, it don't get more ghetto than this

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Big Tymin in a bubble-eye Lex, so fly (so fly! so fly!)
I cook/cut crack, that's the sizing
Them big, big rims on tires, and, we shinin
Me and Weezy (holla holla) gold rims can't see me (holla holla)
New Benz on tweezies (holla holla)
Cadillac truck beamin, fo sheezy

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
From hood to hood, bitch nigga, yard to yard
Hey I'm your "herr-o" cause I've got that heroin and that raw
Check the rims on my car
Naw, don't check em, though, cause they stuffed with blow
Weezy Baby, still in the kitchen
Just put a little curve on the shit I'm pitchin
You need a hit, I'm Mark McGwire, come holla
I watch the base at home, I'm umpire

[Verse 5: Clipse]
Grin-ding, you know what I keep in the lining
Niggas better stay in line when
They see a nigga like me shinin
Grin-ding, you know what I keep in the lining
Niggas better stay in line when
When you see a nigga like me shinin (Grinding!)

[Verse 6: Malice]
Took 13 South, cross the Bay Bridge with it
Ring the triangle, dinner bell, come and get it!
The time in the kitchen, I dare not mention
When my cell phone echo, I swear they listening
'89 was my beginning, y'all
Young snot-nosed, pack yams in a tennis ball
Cops swore we was playing catch, no!
We was adding stretch, no choice, beg till you outta breath
I ducked the Feds, they seen my weight grow
Streets love Malice for his comeback ratio
If they got popped, we made sure they made bail
Cause if not, we be scared they gon tell
Pattycake, that's me, bake the pies
Pyrex, mixed that, scrape the sides
Grindin, Glock-9 in the lining
May God strike a nigga dead if he lying

Yo! Ah! Ah! People sell dem soul a for a slice of bread
Don't watch how man business may get eye turn red
Pay attention to like how easy man dead

Don't get mi angry mon or neither fled
Nuff snitches a work for CIA and feds

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I be the first one to bust, first one you lust
Experiential flows, that make our souls touch
When it comes to heat, 40-cally chrome clutch
Out the Berlinetta teal-blue and gilded up
Sorry no introduction, I was speedin'
First name Terrar, first half the Clipse that leave you bleeding
Got phony rap cats, be actin' obsurd
Fake hardcore, and really y'all lovebirds
My dogs flip bricks and live in the suburbs
While y'all on the block sweatin' what the next heard
Sick over this, like I had you sippin' on piss
Type thing I do to fake Dons, thinkin' it's Cris
My relations, love hate, my family, love hate
How you hold your heat sideways, expect to shoot straight
My crib ADT nightly, with steel gates
And the only thing that separates us is drug weight

[Hook]
How can hear me out yo, what I'm talking 'bout yo
You don't want to get in this game
The world's my monopoly, with your bitch on top of me
You don't want to get in this game
So roll your dice.. tell me what you got
Is it your ice.. or is it your life
Do what's right.. cause you can't roll twice
Safety's stuck, give a fuck, negotiating with price

[Verse 2: Malice]
Malice, from the Clipse, laser tap with steel tips
Hold like two rubber grips, with snug fit
You know the type, money your wice, money your life
Or either at the club sippin' on Henny and ice
Shit, we plenty nice, own it at any price
Got them hardcore, wannabe thugs callin' on Christ
Yo, I run with common, who be dippin' on they bonds
Man, bullets and slugs, all the above but times ten
It can be love, like hugs and kiss, clubs or fists
Or Malice, good enough your shit like bloods and crips
Twist ya chil-mo, hit the road in double R's
Me and girlfriend, mix drinks and double straws
If you heard, that my dog is strapped, cause they are
Take kinda know face, that sound familiar?
Watch your step, those that slept, they still sleepin'
Left 'em with two in they chest and still leakin'

[Hook]

[Outro: Pusha T]
I tried to tell you
You don't want to get in this game
But you didn't listen
You didn't fuckin' listen, now look at you
Yo, stakes is higher now bitch
Stakes is higher now
Yo, everybody else
Consider yourself warned

[Hook]

[Intro: Pharrell]
Straight crushing you

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hello new world, here we come on them Twinkie trains
With the hood screaming, "We on our way"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screaming, "I'm on my way!"
Yes, I rap, but best believe, them things still get wrapped
By Papi, screaming, "It's on its way!"
I can't wait for the next nigga from my hood to say
"Look out world, I'm on my way"

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I listen to the beat and the rhyme is wrote
See, I was 16, eyes full of hope
Bagging up grams at the Hyatt, though
The news called it crack, I called it Diet Coke (Ohhh!)
At the same time, hiding from mama, dodging the drama
Fucking plenty bitches while ducking the baby mama
I found poetry, excuse me, Floetry
"Say yes!" niggas hear the "yuugh!" and they know it's me
Make ‘em sick to their stomach how they s'posed to be
Sipping on a 50 foot yacht, nigga, motion free
Ocean in my backyard where its s'posed to be
Funny how my neighbors don't think its where I'm s'posed to be
They think I'm cuter in jail
But the only time I'm boxed in is when the roof's on the SL
And that even come off, so that would mean I'm visiting
New world, I hope y'all listening, envisioning

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hello new world, here we come on them Twinkie trains
With the hood screaming, "We on our way"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screaming, "I'm on my way!"
Yes, I rap, but best believe, them things still get wrapped
By Papi, screaming, "It's on its way!"
I can't wait for the next nigga from my hood to say
"Look out world, I'm on my way"

[Verse 2 - Malice]
This goes out to my A-alikes that hang out on them corners
Who rock Air Nikes, live a hustler's way of life
In white tees, constantly, ducking from Ds
Pumping that D arm readily, waiting to squeeze
Who stay cookin, stay lookin, over they shoulders
Holdin them boulders, tryin to avoid central booking
I ain't coming at ‘cha, quote-unquote "famous rapper"
Who turn positive, try to tell ya how to live
But this information I must pass to the homies
If hustling is a must, be Sosa, not Tony
We can all shine, I want your wrist lit like mine
Neck and ears, I want it lit like mine
Foreign cars, stick shift, six gears like mine
Anything that keep mama from crying, visiting
You from behind that glass, while you away, sentencing
'Cause the judge is saying "Life" like it ain't someone's life

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hello new world, here we come on them Twinkie trains
With the hood screaming, "We on our way"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screaming, "I'm on my way!"
Yes, I rap, but best believe, them things still get wrapped
By Papi, screaming, "It's on its way!"
I can't wait for the next nigga from my hood to say
"Look out world, I'm on my way"

[Interlude - Grimey]
Yo, what up, what up. This is ya man Grimey from downtown Norfolk. Just want y'all to know it's about time for us to come up and make a change, man. They keep tryin' to keep us down, but that ain't the way to be, man. It's about time for us to get it together, man. Ery'body else put they shit together. Why the niggas can't get together, put they money together? Hustlers come together with hustlers, know what I'm saying? This ain't just for the playas in VA. This for playas all over the world. This is Grimey

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Times-a-wasting, niggas doin so much hatin
Free ya heart, and show ya greatness
I, like you, had to come from up under the basement
Just like you, had Satan tryin my patience
Still you look at me through jealous eyes
I wish to see all my niggas rise up! Get that money
Put them 9s up, piggy-back out the ghetto ‘for times up!
Niggas rush!

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hello new world, here we come on them Twinkie trains
With the hood screaming, "We on our way"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screaming, "I'm on my way!"
Yes, I rap, but best believe, them things still get wrapped
By Papi, screaming, "It's on its way!"
I can't wait for the next nigga from my hood to say
"Look out world, I'm on my way"



[Intro: Pharrell, Pusha T & Malice]
Hello?
Yo Pharrell, get the fuck up, get the fuck up right now
Huh?
Yo, it's your day date and we go this nigga tied down, right now
Yo, wait til' I get there
Dawg, you ain't gonna make it out of here bitch
Fuck what you thinkin' nigga?
Hold him up yo, ya'll ready to do this nigga
Why not, I got his ass, I got his ass

[Verse - Malice]
You don't really want none of this though
I let 'em know from the get go
See ya'll is a bit slow
Tryin' come wit the hits but they missed though
Retaliate make 'em drop like a six fo'
Why you hate cause I didn't give a shoutout
Or the way that my shine turn the spot out
You think you can rhyme but you not out
Or the way we drop the top when it's hot out
Anyone you can pick and choose
Why ya'll stagnant, my niggas stick and move
My name say it all, ain't got shit to prove
My whole mental ain't shit to lose
You all niggas snooze if you wanna
But you gonna be a gonna, please forgive me, your honor
But that fool tried to take what's mine
That's the reason I had to utilize my nine
Otherwise, you can be right here now
Talkin' bout how the Clipse don' bit his style (style)
Back in the day how we did him foul (foul)
Or how we don' switched, how you like me now?
And anything else that them haters may say
Come how you want, just bring it the right way
Mayday, what they gon say
Coming to they hood, the Clipse and Tammy

[Hook - Tammy Lucas]
Mother fucker what you here for?
Now you wonder why I gotta the chrome four to your ear for
So you can hear yo (Uncle Terrar you gon let him go?)
I don't know
Count to a hundred wit yo eyes closed
Soon every number is a face of a nigga that's gon die yo
They try to hit me but they too slow (Daddy, you gon' let him go)
I don't know

[Verse - Pusha T]
Are you ready for the showdown?
It won't be pretty if I get another go down
In all aspects, low down
When I hit him, make sure he won't see another go round
What make him think he can flame wit me
Now he hatin' life cause he tried to bang wit me
Had to show him death weren't a thing to me
Nothin more than a mere blood stain to me
It's pain to see, ain't a nigga rank wit me
Better yet, ain't a mother fucker hangin me
Ten more on your side, what your odds gon be
Slim to none cause they all want to run wit me
The nerve to ask, why terrar hold the heat?
Hopelessly, they try to steal my deal just to roast the feat
If I'm the one from being followed
Have my girl double back, mack eleven make m holla
And it's just that easy, one trigger one sque-eze
And he droppin' to his kne-es; damn right, lit him up
Give a fuck about him let the paramedic get him up
I had to muffle his heart beat
Hit everything but the baby in the back in the car seat
Had to show his partner talk cheap
And I'ma draw heat, if a nigga think I wanna walk for heat

[Hook]

[Bridge - Tammy Lucas] (4x)
Think about the things you did
And the things you didn't as a kid
No time to stop cause I'm gonna end your life

[Tammy Lucas - repeat to Hook]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Man I'm killin' it ridin' in that brand new
Swimmin' through the streets lookin' like I'm Shamu
In that big body, with the wet paint
I got some pocket change from selling wet weight
Today is a good day, ice cubes on my chest
Lookin' at my Blackberry, freak hit me on the text
Come and beat it up, I just need a minute
You can carry ya ass, you ain't gotta lay in it (yes!)
Niggas don't like it when you lookin' good
Hate it when you shinin' through the neighborhood
Brand new ride, niggas know the time
Hoes cut they eyes, we call them samurais
(Whaaa!) Fly as I could ever be!
A level of success that you could never see
You jealous mane, we in propellers mane
Think about it, ain't shit you can tell us mane

[Verse 2: Malice]
Cruisin' on them 22's got me sittin' pretty
You should hear that engine purr, here kitty kitty
Ride through the city, e'erbody know me
And the sun is out, it's like it's shinin on me
Shoutin out the homies as I breeze by
I'm on cloud 9, and I ain't even high
Told my shorty I'll be back and I ain't even lie
Them VVSs be the best that money can buy
I see you flirtin baby, them jeans is painted on her
Mama lookin right, and I don't even want her
No need to take it personal but that's just how it be
No disrespect to you, I'm just enjoyin me
Finally I'm free, all my dues paid
Them yellow diamonds got the charm like it's Minute Maid
And I'm lookin good, and I'm feelin good
Try and stop my shine, I wish a nigga would

[Intro: Pusha T]
No, no, no!
I told you!
I ain't up here just rappin' and tappin'
Spittin' and skittin' and shit
Naw, uh-uh
Not me
I'm not you, I'm not you, rapper
I'm not you
Pusha

[Verse One: Pusha T]
I keep that ziploc bustin at the stitches
Culinary chemist, I serve the malicious
To break the fiends fixes, one give you the sniffles
The other leave you with the itches
Transport airport with the vaseline, so I can
Fulfill my dreams of pastures that's green
More cash then ya seen, with an Aston that's green
Me driving up fast with the lean
Zonin' family, keep youngins in them rented Camrys
Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Nah, bitch, we don't believe in air bags
Cars turn tricks like them Ringling Brothers skits
Whether bitch hop out, or the Glock pop out
Ya know what I'm about, blow to ya sinus 'til the snot drop out

[Verse Two: Jadakiss]
Whoever said birds fly south for the winter's a damn lie
Got em right here, and if I don't like you the grams hide
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend taste it they need it
Make 'em smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it
Prolly think I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lot of shots, A.I. style
AndJada, the name is filthy, but so what?
The motherfuckin game is filthy, you know what?
My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the manteca, and the 'caine that built me so I
Could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker
When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin you love, your own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows, or dreads, I will eliminate

[Verse Three: Roscoe P. Coldchain]
I'm far from a noodle nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sets
Nigga that's funny, you say you a killa how?
What is it, the return of the killer clown?
Akhi, you put no fear in my heart
I make ya people say wow that didn't look like my man
They flipped upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit with ten rounds, at point blank, and point blank
Coldchain left that nigga stankin
Half static and face I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and I didn't give em a chance to blink
When I jogged up on em, pressed the forty up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby, I rocked 'em
The Coffin the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end, and you a thug that pretends
Call Coldchain "Super-Nigga," I got X-Ray vision I see through men
And squeeze triggers with bullets that go through men

[Verse Four: Styles P]
Fuck with S.P., that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll break ya chest, No sleep
Like I hate the restm I'm in the hood like its my fate to rep
I hold it down, any place I step
And I love getting slept on, 'cause I'm rawer than dope
Fresh out of Africa that never been stepped on
Dog, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the Ghost the main reason why your set gone
Why I love riffing 'em poor, you wouldn't understand
Cause my God is different than yours
If the world spin in a circle, I want to learn to move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for, creeping through the hood and
Shit ain't really good, but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a bull
I want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull

[Verse Five: Malice]
Rappers is talking to me as if (come on)
We in the same boat I tell them quick, no, I move Coke! (uh-uh)
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms (No)
It shames me to no end
To feed poison to those who could very well be my kin (uh-huh)
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs, at the same time, cry
Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls, and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the street
I see them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat (so sorry)
And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit (I ain't shit)
My heart bleed but that's aside from the fact
I live for my kids and theirs and them youngins after that



[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Playas we ain't the same, I'm into 'caine and guns
Chopard with the fishes, make the face lift numb
Out in Panama in that amazing sun; I'm amazing, son
You niggas wonder where my grace is from
I speak with corrupted tongue
Recognized the underworld since I was young
Back in '84 when I saw Crockett & Tubbs as the law
These eyes got big when they televised that raw
My mama should've seen it comin'
Me runnin' up and down the stairs too quick
Hummin' Miami Vice theme music
Calderone made me colder
I see the villains' impact, now that I'm older
Ignorant fool, views ignorant, too
Got a lot of money, keep militant tools
Wasn't present the session they handed out the rules
So I gravitated, related to life's cruels
The meaning? Pusha T's more than he's seeming
Not just a rap name, more so like a damn shame
Nothing's changed, just the crimes is less heinous
The three of us know, yet the shooter remains nameless
And I don't even watch my back
I was raw before rap, and I ain't lost my past
Shit could get hairy, I could lose myself in a flash
Niggas'll think I'm Jim Carrey how I off that mask

[Verse 2: Malice]
I even went by the book at first
Until I realized 9 to 5 wouldn't quench my thirst
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Mama knew that a child like me had better sense
But something had to give, that's real, I had to live
I chefed that soft white and pumped from her crib
Scout's honor, started with my grandmama
Who distributed yay she had flown in from the Bahamas
Partner, please, I grinds, I hustle with ease
Can damn near eyeball any weight in my sleep
I don't entertain hate surrounding the street
If I was you, I'd be tryna get down with me
But no, see these niggas know too much
Meanwhile I rock jewels that look like my diamonds blush
Cats act as if rap fell in my lap
I've suffered heartbreak many times back to back
And still feel belittled sittin' here spittin' riddles
Amongst clown ass rappers who tend to give me the giggles
Let 'em take it however they wanna take it
I'm the reason your favorite MC's no longer your favorite
Hey, I'm one of the greats, I can't lie
I mean great to the point I'm concerned I might die
Make no mistake, Malice is who you tuned to
It's all in the name, trust, I will wound you



[Hook: Pusha T]
Keys open doors
Keys open doors

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
(Yuugh!) Make your skin crawl
Press one button, let the wind fall
Who gonna stop us? Fuck the coppers!
The mind of a kilo shopper
Seeing my life through the windshields of choppers
I ain't spend one rap dollar in 3 years, holla!
Money's the leash, drag a bitch by her dog collar
Now, ho follow, this is my ghetto story
Like Cham, Ice-P is the Don Dada
Open the Frigidaire, 25 to life in here
So much white you might think your holy Christ is near
Throw on your Louis V millionaires to kill the glare
Ice trays? Nada! All you see is pigeons paired
The realest shit I ever wrote, not Pac inspired
It's crack pot inspired, my real niggas quote
Bitch never cook my coke! Why? Never trust a ho with your child
At you make believe rappers I smile! HA! Canal Streeting my style
Like you internet sharing my files, you MySpace niggas
So kill the comparison, I'm South Beach sipping on Sarafin
Royalty check nigga, I never been
Cook money clean through Merrill Lynch
Accountant just gasp at the smell of it! (Gasp!)
Meet the dealer, ain't a bitch realer
So you ain't gotta question why Pusha don't feel ya!
Knock it the fuck off!

[Hook]
Keys open doors
Keys open doors

[Verse 2: Malice]
Throw it on the scale, feed your God damn self
Get it how you live, we don't ask for help (No)
Word on the street is you gonna love how it melt
And I don't come with a pitch neither, the shit sell itself
I yell "Re-Up" til I'm locked like Mumia
And get it 'cross-state with the grace of Maria
Keep on toys, you goin' know us when you see us
Living street tales worthy of Don Divas
Keys in the floor, mistress in Dior
Bitch tell me she love me but I know she's a whore
Shit could get ugly, shit she talk to the law
And that's just what I get, it's the Roses of War
Fuck the Bureau! Rather be spending Euros
And get fed grapes, fuck hoes in plurals
Just like heaven as I gaze at the mural
What a peace of mind when you cop you some Shapiros
Cheers to the future as we toast to life
I'm Prive-ing in Miami, I'm a socialite nigga
The cars are big, the cribs are bigger
The kids are happy, the perfect picture
Gemstar razor, the fruit of my labor
And I walk with a glow, it's like the Lord's shown favor
These bitches fake like the hoes on Flavor
But I don't mind spending, all it is is paper, yes!

[Hook]
Keys open doors
Keys open doors



[Intro]
Til the Casket Drops!
Third time's the charm right? Hahaha! Come on

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I'm kinda like a big deal, it's unbelievable
You see my warning gives you big chills
The flow running on BIG's heels
My life after death, BIG ain't get to see how this feels
Third time's the charm, baby
After two classics another stripe up on my arm baby
It's a blessing to blow a hundred thou in a recession
With no second guessin'
Ha-ha, we're ballin', drop tops we're floorin'
Champagne we're pourin', Re-Up is the gang and I'm all in
To the powder and the flame I have fallen
Get money, blow money is my calling
Yeah, watch a nigga burn through it
Life's a maze, you twist and you turn through it
The driest of droughts, maneuvered and I earned through it
I'm set straight like a perm do it, Push

[Hook: Pusha T]
They whispering about us, I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money? We ain't even finished counting
Pardon me, I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ayo, I'm sitting on top of the, it's more than a feeling, ain't it?
I be killing, damn it, I'm illin', I'm illin', ay-ay-ay-ay
Meet Mr. Popular, go get your binoculars
And see Penthouse 3 where a nigga be
Spitting fire on the PJ in my PJs
Fire Marshall said I took it to the max like TJ
Y'all ain't peep, I said Marshall's, replay
I guess I'm like the black Marshall meets Jay
Meet 'Ye, alligator souffle, got it made
Special Ed got head from a girl in special ed
You know the pretty ones in that dumb class
But she got that dumb ass
Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast
"What happened, Tisha, your boyfriend come fast?"
Turn around, give me pound like we folks
"Hell no, I went raw-dog, three strokes!"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Malice]
Lights, cameras, action!
The chain itself's a damn distraction
You claim the belt, the glory I bask in
I'm B. Hop in the ring, niggas, you cash in, it's like
Stopping a train, nigga think he's stopping my reign
Talk slick while dropping my name?
I'm putting y'all to shame, diamonds in the little hand
50 percent splits, I X out the middleman
A far cry from a stash in the rental van
I'm the reason the hood need a dental plan
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing
The C-4S with the rims protruding
The roof vamoose, like a magic show
Got me looking to the heavens like a javelin throw
Y'all twiddle your thumbs like the average Joe
But just as you reap, so shall you sow

[Hook]



(Jermaine Dupri)
Uh huh, oh
Oh, damn baby
Shit...........
How you get all that in them jeans?
Nevermind that, you hear this?
It's that Star Trak
Clipse, (get down!)
So So Def

[Verse 1 - Pusha T]
Question - ask any nigga
Rapper or a hustler, who rocks is bigger?
(Pharrell Williams) - The rapper!
Naw, dawg, go figure
With the B-12, I make that straight killa
I flood the block, I hug the Glock
I have a whole neighborhood asking a thug to stop (Stop!)
Cause I show 'em what Waco see
Then hit the district pay a visit to Jac-o-b
I like my diamonds colored, watch is smothered (me too)
Show off at the place of jewels, let the white man love it (hahaha)
I'm too much, got bitches out for me
Bring 'em home, give 'em they choice of balcony
She said "We can have more fun", I said "How can we?"
Then she brought her girl in and ate her out for me, wow (Wow!)
All night sexin', just think, this all came from one question

[Hook - Jermaine Dupri]
You got a big ass bell? Lemme see you jingle it baby
You got a big ass bell? Lemme see you jingle it baby
Wanna talk about cars? Lets talk about it
Wanna talk about a house? Lets talk about it
Wanna talk about jewels? Lets talk about it
Wanna talk about money? Don't talk without it
Wanna talk about chicks? Lets talk about it
Wanna talk about hits? Lets talk about it
Wanna talk about cris? Lets talk about it
But when you talk about cash, don't talk without it

[Verse 2 - Jermaine Dupri]
Now as the game rotates, and my chrome gets bigger
More and more girls wanna fuck this nigga
Hard for a chick not to stick around
When I come through town, layin my dick down
They can tell a true playa by the clothes that I wear
Game that I spit, and the length of my hair (Ok)
The more I come, the more I cum, get it?
What you see now, I been done did it
Every girl around, I been done hit it
Cars been kitted, since I was sixteen
And yes, I'm still spendin' that Kris Kross cream (haha)
Big boy moves, big boy shine
Big boy watch tell big boy time
Everybody know I got the recipe, so you know ya'll niggas can't mess with me
Matter of fact, I don't even gotta say no mo' (Oh)

[Hook - Jermaine Dupri]

[Hook - Pharrell Williams and Jermaine Dupri]
Na na, (OH) na na na na na na
(Come on girl)
Na na na na na na (Oh)
Na na na na na na na (Come on girl)
Na na na na na na (Oh)
Na na na na na na (Come on girl)
Na na na na na na (Oh)
(I want you to move your waist for the whistle)
Na na na na na na (Come on girl)

[Verse 3 - Malice]
It ain't too many things that exceed my reach
Speedboat, glass floor, let you see underneath
But nevermind that though, I'm just showing off
As I do in the Porsche with the top lost
I ain't change the game hash, you know the name as
Malice in my wrist, like shattered stain glass
I generate them Franklin's and Grant's
Each ear look like a halogen lamp
I'm high beamin, at the same time leanin'
In the butter soft seat that keep a street thug scheming'
'For we compare paper, get your weight up
I need more points than that, don't you play with me, Jacob
You see me on my back, you see me live
I'm every color of the spectrum, like ROY G. BIV
Look dawg, get a load of how daddy ball
Wanna talk about cash?
Well I done said it all

[Hook]



[Hook: Kenna & Pharrell] (with ad-libs)
Last night what I seen made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change
Ye-yet yet yet I move on, (You know I gotta go and get it)
Yeh-yes I move on (There ain't no other choice in it)
Yeh-yes I move on (Ain't tryin' to be a part of the percentage)
Yeh-yes I move on (Hear me out now)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Where I'm from see us guys don't believe in luck (No!)
I can't believe what they doin' to my nigga, Buck
(Tryin' to hang my nigga!)
Facin' time, twenty-five to life
Twenty-five the same thing as life (You tell me!)
Only chips is to fight or to forfeit
Baby momma tryin' to make the mortgage
Daughters prayin', try'na put cha back up in the portrait
Uh, it's like the tears never stop
When you was home it's like they smiles never drop
Collect calls with all the hopes of the best
And hang up with a knot in my chest
See, see your cell is my hell
My hell is our pain
The hurt gonn' never stop until we see you home again
And that's all we wanna see
Maybe in a dream, but not a memory
Forget that, hold your head man, head man
Last night what I seen made my life change

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Malice]
I was wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked (Filthy!)
So much so I had left my family forsaken (I'm sorry, babe!)
A troubled soul whose heart was often achin' (Can you forgive me?)
So much dough but my spirit ever so vacant
Foul and flagrant, I was taken off course (I was lost!)
The road ahead should have ended me in divorce (I see now)
But now I see clearly with the family of four
Never did I deserve a two-seater Porsche (Never!)
Heart filled with remorse, my life was such a mess
Now I'm back on board, due to the Lord's GPS (I'm back!)
180 degree turn, whoever could've guessed?
Malice believe in his heart and out my mouth I confess
YES... more than blessed, I was choosen
I been on the troop, my wisdom is that of old men
Wasted so much time stuntin' for folk (Wasted so much time!)
When really the whole time I was just stuntin' my growth (Can't get that back!)
A message to the youth, what I'm offerin' is hope
Now something's gotta change. I'm at the end of my rope, cause

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Uh, Lord knows I done seen the worlds cold shoulder
Seein my future through the crystal-ball of bakin' soda
Oasis of hoes, my champagne supernova
The high life and high times, I watched 'em turn sober
Seen it all come crashin', crashin'
The Feds was at the door, and no they not askin'
Sayin' they found drugs, but they ain't talkin' aspirin
Diesel design ones and I ain't talkin' fashion

[Verse 4: Malice]
Money hoes and clothes is Malice's past tense (The past is past!)
All said forgiven, all you do is askin'
Even when laughin' I can't explain the hurt
Knowin' I can't change the world in a verse (I wish I could!)
Even to myself, I'm feelin' my screw's loose
But how can I deny what I know to be true? (I gotta live with myself!)
When I didn't have a clue, shoulda viewed it as a gift
Now I see what they mean - ignorance is bliss (I see what they mean)

[Pharell]
I wanna love you girl
Just wanna love you girl
Please let me love you girl
Just wanna love you girl
C'mon, I wanna love you girl
Just wanna love you girl
Let me love you girl
Let me...

[Pusha T]
When we met I was talkin' that game
Parkin' that thang
Since then between us
A lot of things changed
Now it's like the world got a whole different name
I can't stop chicks from sayin' my name
Most of it's lies
If not, don't be surprised
You knew I was ballin' when I met you
But really, I started layin' low just to net you
I'm raw as hell yet can't deny that you special
These girls can't either
Winter, his and her Vivas
Summer, his and her Louie sneakers
You don't think that bother people
Guess again you even need to check your friends
Sayin that I cheat
Right, maybe with my heat
Got a pearl handled chrome thing that I call Sweets
I greet wit her, creep wit her, even eat wit her
Late nights under my sheets, yeah I sleep with her
But thats it

Chorus:
[Pusha T + Malice with Faith Evans] (Faith)
Look
Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds
But that's not it
Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit (No)
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit (No)
If the answers no don't forget (How's she know you then)
I don't know

[Malice]
If I don't know I don't know, lets not go that road
I don't know who she is, don't care who told
Look stop flippin', no need to explode
I seen the number in the pager, I don't know that code
In the streets too much, c'mon, that's absurd
Gettin' no complaints when I be flippin' them birds
Your girls just talk 'bout this that and the third
Believe half what you see none of what you heard
You askin' me who's her I'm askin' who's mink fur
With that rock on her hand makin' their eyes blurred
Could that be you plus who cop every gem
Who spend like I spend, then act like it then
Got the dream home and we settled in it
Our lives too perfect that's why they meddle in it
Now, just chalk it up as just part of the game
You know who I'm about, who got part of my name?

Chorus

[Faith] (Malice)
Do you love me babe (Sho' you right)
You thinkin' of me babe (Well atleast tonight)
I bet you'd tell me anything (Yea thats right)
Just to be with me (Yep and tonight's the night)
(2X)

[Malice]
I'm not most men my heart truer than theirs
Of course your girls hate, our whips newer than theirs
We hardly fight, arguements way fewer than theirs
Even down to the ice, look, bluer than theirs
What they gonna tell us about us, Huh?
What they talk 'bout without us, Huh?
The envy got 'em speakin loosely
Tell 'em walk in your shoes
But first let 'em know they Gucci

[Pusha T]
And even if I did twist her
I promise I didn't kiss her
Won't shit touchy feely
Grudge on the floor like Mister did to Celie
No respect shown
My homies laugh while she talk dirty on the speaker phone
Now don't you start
I spared your heart
If you ain't see it I didn't do it
Ain't I played my part?
Bricks chics whips chips, that just go with the grind
What else do you want from me, to say it, fine

Chorus

[Faith] (Malice) (*with Pharell's verse in background*)
Do you love me babe (Sho' you right)
You thinkin of me babe (Well atleast tonight)
I bet you'd tell me anything (Yea thats right)
Just to be with me (Yep and tonight's the night)
(2X)

[Faith singing]

[Faith, Pusha T + Malice]
That's not it



[Pusha T & Pharrell: Intro]
Gather round!
Miami Vice
All my cocaine dreamers, ya know
Miami Vice
Pusha spit this shit for y'all, here we go

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Youngin' don't make my sales rise
I shoot you out ya Chuckers
Pusha hear the whispers of all you motherfuckers
Papa said stay free of them suckers, minus the wicked jumper
Street baller like the Rucker, Skip to My Lou
If you lookin for a couple, roosters in the duffle
Keep the hood screaming Cock-a-Doodle Doo, fuckers
Coke by the ton, rap niggas, I'm the one
With basic rhyme pattern, how the fuck you tryin' to chatter?
ASIC ass rappers, got 'em runnin' for they life
I philosophize about Glocks and Kis
Niggas call me young black Socrates
West Indies bitch drop to knees quick (what?)
With dreams of being a rich man's bitch
Feel sorry for niggas, pull triggas and they shit click
So many bullets jammed in my shit, call me lead-fist
Shake the diamonds out my wrists

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
I don't fear Tubbs & Crockett
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Got two hot rocks in my pocket
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Big home, palm trees, and watches
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
My only accomplice is my conscience, uh (Gather round!)

[Verse 2 - Malice]
Youngin', learn from me, let's not be at odds
Were more like than not, 2 peas of a pod
Same hustle, 'cept my hustle now flows
I once gave it away, at 30 grams a O
That accounts for all them days in the cold
Feels like kids and cake mix, can't wait to lick the bowl
But it's a bigger picture, homes trust I done seen it
From Frankfurt to Cologne, Oslo to Sweden
From Italy's Milan to the shores of Napoli
Now I consider Ferrari and Salvador Dalis
I'm no longer local, my thoughts are global
That's why I seem distant, son, expand ya vision
Even adored by Norwegian woman
Blonde hair and blue eyes, I'm gettin' back with a vengeance
Whip it like they want me all attached to the kitten
And they wonder in these raps if I'm kiddin', huh

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
I don't fear Tubbs & Crockett
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Got two hot rocks in my pocket
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Big home, palm trees, and watches
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
My only accomplice is my conscience, uh

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
(Miami Vice) Sorry Heavenly Father, once again I hate to bother
It's P the evil creeper send some to the Grim Reaper
Meanwhile, me and my Mrs. like Solomon and Sheba
Sign of the times, her Emilio Pucci sneakers, uh
Ghetto literature, I'd damn near die for Bolivia
It don't take much to get rid of ya, once I send for ya
Better call the minister, yuugh!

[Verse 4: Malice]
I'm sorry, Grandmama, for mistakes I have made
When I aired family business, how you put me in my place
Even my baby mama, I can't look you in the face
'Cause I can't do enough, you a symbol of God's grace
So I place you in the flowerbed, porcelain shower heads
Throughout the house and keep the youngins' mouths fed
And when I'm gone, I hope it is said
I gave structure to the youth by the example I led, uh

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
I don't fear Tubbs & Crockett
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Got two hot rocks in my pocket
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Big home, palm trees, and watches
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
My only accomplice is my conscience, uh
(Miami Vice)

[Intro: Pharrell]
You know we back, right?
Clear the streets out
Come on with it, ha-ha, Star Trak

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Niggas is haters, I'm doin' deals like the majors
Ice Cream sneakers, I signed my first skater
So you can pay three and buy yourself some Bapestas
Bulletproof under t-shirts because they hate us
Do like Snoop say step, your game up
Double-decker boat nigga, Meditterane up
D-Class Asscher cuts, tuck your chain up
Liberace fingers, niggas hit Lorraine up
Just last week, I was out in Aspen
Me and Puff hoppin' off the plane, both us laughin'
A week before that, I was out in Italy
Italian heart throbs could not get rid of me
Up in Donatella's crib, me and like ten hoes
Call from the cell phone, "Give me that Enzo"
I know what your thinkin', "Yeah, me too"
Okay, everybody meet Mr. Me Too

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Been two years, like I was paddy wagon cruisin'
The streets was yours, you're dunce cappin' and kazooin'
I was just assumin' you'd keep the coke movin'
But I got one question, fuck y'all been doin'?
Pyrex stirs turned into Cavalli furs
The full length cat, when I wave, the kitty purs
All my niggas caked up, sellin' gray and beige dust
Had that money right or end up in the trunk taped up
We don't chase and duck, we only raise the bucks
Peel money rolls 'til our thumbs get the paper cuts
Chill retardo, South Beach Gallardo
Teals started up, go brr like it's Nardo
Women, if you love me, please let me know
Tie rags around your neck and learn the sets we throw
These are the days of our lives and I'm sorry to the fans
But the crackers weren't playin' fair at Jive

[Hook: Pusha T and Malice]
I know, I know, yeap yeah, you too
Okay we get it, yeap yeah you too
I know, I know, yeap yeah, you too
Okay, everybody meet Mr. Me Too
I know, I know, yeap yeah, you too
Okay we get it, yeap yeah you too
I know, I know, yeap yeah, you too
Okay, everybody meet Mr. Me Too

[Bridge: Pharrell]
I know what you thinkin' why I call you Me Too?
Cause everythin' I say, I got you sayin' me too
I say I got a Benz, so you said me too
You hangin' out the window so they can see you
But you ain't hangin' out the window
When you in that G2 or that G3 or G4 like we do
Star Trak, Clipse, Malice, come on

[Verse 3: Malice]
Wanna know the time? Better clock us
Niggas bite the style from the shoes to the watches
We cloud hoppers, tailored suits like we mobsters
Break down keys into dimes and sell them like Gobstoppers
Who gon' stop us? Not a goddamn one of you
Mean with the Re-Up, nigga, we street tumblers
Ivory white, yeah that's the same color
Of the Azure nigga, best believe it's the Mulliner
Take no prisoners, rap niggas are whisperers
Choke on your own spit just as soon as you mention us
Champagne corks, kicks by Louis sports and
Keep my hoes in Pucc' and Charles Jourdan, uh!
Cop it, chrome it, touch-screen component
Mink on the floor, make you hot, don't it?
You don't wanna know what the fuck I spent on it
Tomorrow ain't promised so we live for the moment

[Hook: Pusha T and Malice]
I know, I know, yeap yeah, you too
Okay we get it, yeap yeah you too
I know, I know, yeap yeah, you too
Okay, everybody meet Mr. Me Too
I know, I know, yeap yeah, you too
Okay we get it, yeap yeah you too
I know, I know, yeap yeah, you too
Okay, everybody meet Mr. Me Too



Never will it stop
The 50 in the duffel won't crush
It settles to the bottom like dust
Fuck what ya heard
You ain't countin' paper like us
A million in the ceiling I can touch

[Verse 1: Pusha-T]
Go-getter, I come from the corner like most niggas
Now from afar, I toast niggas, roast niggas
Anywhere, whichever the coast nigga
Compare me to them 2 ghost niggas - Hail Mary
Heart break when they tales fairy
I kissed that girl and I likes it, like Kate Perry
The tongue-tester, niggas on the corner
Juggle Os for the king, like a jester
Child of a lesser - God, so when I drop the top
It's my way of feeling closer to the Lord
Reaching for the heavens; 'till then, I settle for the 7
30 floors upper room key, at the Western
With her on her back, and her on her knees
My ghetto ass trying to pronounce they dungarees
I say Raph, they say Raf Simon
They think it's real cute while they giving me dome

[Verse 2: Ab-Liva]
Liva. Heh, the cross I bear
So fly in that purple label cloth I wear
No matter the cost, I make Porsche like fear
Every stitch, every seam, when I floss, y'all stare
Ferrari 500 them horse I tear
I circle, I veer, y'all pause like deer
In the headlights, mami play red light, green light
And hop that red torch I steer
There's no law I've feared
Arm glowin' like a roadside flare
King-pin, so the soft I shared
I carried, I huddled, I dared
I muscled, I bled, I sweated, I teared
Got crowned 'n got cheered
You 10 Grand quarter-pound ration
Went 36 flat, that's a asking
Now two-thirds got it for a fraction, a cinder --
Put in the dash in the fender
Dryer sheets, that cover that scent that it renders

[Hook: Pusha T]
Never will it stop
Ever, never, never will it stop
Ever, never, never will it stop
Ever, never, never will it stop
Never will it stop, the 50 in the duffel won't crush
It settles to the bottom like dust
Fuck what ya heard, you ain't countin' paper like us
A million in the ceiling I can touch

[Verse 3: Malice]
And still don't nothing move but the money
Nothing like 50 bricks, wrapped like the Mu-mmy
With the return ensures the Second Coming
So tongue-numbing nigga, you can bet your last
Not a gram off either, you can bet your ass!
I stay with the fifth, since niggas want to grab
Fassst-life, get it y'all is on the fast
And them hoes never say no, 'less they on they rag
Louie bags, I trick 'em with good faith
In hopes they return the favor, with good face
Mentally, my mind in a good place
Wake up e'ery morning admiring landscape --
Hell, even my garage a menage
Like my hoes exotic, same as my cars
Million-dollar deposit, you suffer from withdrawals
I got in the game in the bag like I'm Clause

[Hook]



[Hook - Bilal]
I'm having nightmares...oooooohhh
My niggas say I'm p-noid, they say I'm just p-noid
I'm having nightmares...oooooohhh
My niggas say I'm p-noid, they say I'm just p-noid

[Verse 1 - Bilal]
I'm waking up in the middle of the night
My heartbeat's pumpin' like something ain't right
Oh what's goin' on?
When I go outside I feel something behind me
I'm looking back, but nothin's around me
(Oh what's goin' on...) Man I don't know, what am I trippin' on?
There's something in the room, it's lurkin' in the shadows
Staring through the darkness...man I don't know
These four walls are closing in, these voices ain't my friend
They hauntin' me...those, those memories

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Malice]
They comin' for me, they runnin' up
I'm on my balcony, seeing through the eyes of Tony
They say we homies, but I see hatred
Do not they know brotherly love is sacred?
Niggas catch feelins, even contemplate killins
When you see millions, there are many chameleons
You're not a gunna for real, you're just a runna
Haters, I spot you from afar and I'm the Deer Hunta
They be thinkin' nice car, nice crib
I be thinkin' how long will these niggas let me live
I understand, cause people need things
And they will take it from you, and take you from your seedlings
So even when the mumblers talk
I still walk the most humblest walk
And one day, they may even catch up with me man
But 'til then, I'm Leonardo, Catch Me If You Can, ah!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Pharrell]
Look over your shoulder, something is near
And I'm so scared, when I'm alone I'm so scared
Now it's inching closer, trouble is near
But nothing's there, when I look nothing's there
I'm outta my mind, I'm runnin' from guilt, but
It's right by my side, there's nowhere to hide
I'm outta my mind, I'm runnin' from guilt, but
It's right by my side, there's nowhere to hide

[Verse 4 - Pusha T]
I make big money, drive big cars
Everybody know me, it's like I'm a movie star
Virginia nights, sellin hard white
To sellin' out shows, every gangsta love my flow
Still I creep low, thinking niggas trying to harm me
Hoping my karma ain't coming back here to haunt me
Was it that nigga, I took his powder with a smile
Pray to the Lord, the gun ain't pop and hit the child, shit
I pilt niggas' girls back like alpha-hydroxy
Spent money like Happy Days, I'm the real Fonzie
Top off the coupe, that's how JFK got shot, B
Can't let niggas roll up beside me, and 2Pac me
Holla if you hear me, tears flowing sincerely
Check up on my block weekly, my health yearly
Something's wrong with me, niggas don't get along with me
Got a fo-fo, hope your body got strong kidneys, oh!

[Hook]



[Hook: Pharrell]
Mami you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you?
Heh, you should call me uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand
That new CL fly
Outside of Popeyes eating chicken and fries
Yeah, come holla at your uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
You are now listening to the all-time phenomenal
Used to bag work in VA at the Econo Lo'
Now I'm laying out at the Delano though
But don't get it twisted, the Uzi's in the lining though
Hollow tip dum-dums eat flesh like piranhas though
Such a scary thing to hear the soul sing "Geronimo!"
Pull up in the CL, the shit's astronomical
Hoes lining up on the curb, they fall like dominoes
Used to have this white bitch, she looked like Madonna though
Heard that she fucking LeBron, but shit, I don't know
Like that, Bron-Bron? I had that long time ago
Butt-naked on the balcony at the Dolla-no
I mean the Delano, I mean, Pharrell'll know
The head shop bitch from D.C, ay P, let 'em know!
(Yeah that bitch was hot nigga) Yeah, yeah, but it was time to go
Them hoes come in "eenie, meenie, minie-mo"
Yuugh! Mami you miss me, don't you?

[Hook: Pharrell]
Mami you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you?
Heh, you should call me uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand
That new CL fly
Outside of Popeyes eating chicken and fries
Yeah, come holla at your uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Why wouldn't I be? Look at shorty (Dammmn!)
Uh, mami good down to the cuticles, "I'm Cammm
What's your name, beautiful?" Like (mannn)
I could get used to you
Woulda (rannn) if you knew what I used to do
But call me uncle, yeah Uncle Cam
I tax 'em (like who?) Like Uncle Sam
From the jungle, fam, where niggas bundle grams
Fumble or you crumble, get murked on the humble
(Annnd) The gat on the belt on the hip
(Annnd) I keep it Pharrell with the Clipse
Drive a hard bargain (bargain)
I'm Harlem's only Gar-gar-gin, car foreign
The other man stood-stood stutter-fied
I know your moms well, tell your mother "Hi"
I'm the other guy that got your mother high
Coke like a caterpillar, I make butter fly, I

[Hook: Pharrell]
Mami you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you?
Heh, you should call me uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand
That new CL fly
Outside of Popeyes eating chicken and fries
Yeah, come holla at your uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand

[Verse 3: Malice]
Goddamn, the boy's back
From pushing a mountain of Sno-caps to avoiding the Kojak
The pioneer of the coke rap
I'm dancing with the stars, stepping on blow, doing the toe-tap
The dope return like I had it on LoJack
It made its way home like a road map, I fathered this
If I misled any kid that's fatherless
That burden's on my soul as long I exist
Generation lost, they saying they can't reach us
The answer is the Lord like Saturday Night Fever
I kept it in the crib, it made me a light sleeper
Whether watching for the Feds or avoiding the Grim Reaper
Way deeper than rap, money and hoes, it's deeper than that
Fight the temptation but it keep coming back
Money stacked to the ceiling just as quick as it dispense
Who knew them commas meant you could lose your common sense?
Before it's too late, all I can tell 'em is "Repent," ugh

[Hook: Pharrell]
Mami you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you?
Heh, you should call me uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand
That new CL fly
Outside of Popeyes eating chicken and fries
Yeah, come holla at your uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand



[Intro - Pusha T]
Yeah, you think you got the power
You ain't got the power
You don't tell me that it's okay
I tell you that it's okay
You don't got the power
You don't have the power bitch, what
Yo, yo

[Verse 1 - Pusha T]
Everybody freeze, do what I say, do as I please
Commandeer every ship I steer, follow my lead
Y'all runnin' out of time, cause Terror runnin' out of speed
When I slow, blow up, guaranteed makin' you bleed
This ain't about needs, it's all about greed
And showin' niggas who got the power drop to your knees
These bitches errand boys frontin' like they pushin' keys
When I catch 'em, bless 'em, start mama makin' they wreaths
Because I won't stop firin', till I hear that siren
See your blood trickle, or hear your baby cryin'
Sick of niggas lyin', actin' like they tryin'
To be kamikaze, when they scared of dyin'
No alibi, I got the power no one will testify
Take this lead shower and a black flower where you left to die, ooh
Still life is so soothin', it hurts to see you movin'
So I counteract, take a step back and start shootin'
Terror hit a hollow-tooth frame, you and your dame
So when he wind blows, your bodies whistle likes cranes
Call me by celebrity name, I readily aim
And hit you in your chest, now your shirt readily stained
If there's one I didn't gun down, believe he'll be run down
Because I'm killin' every nigga from, sun up to sun down
Finish them, all adversaries diminishin'
And I'll flee the country before I plead guilty or innocent

[Hook]
You don't have the power
You don't tell me it's okay, I tell you that it's okay
You don't have the power
When I say down, nigga lay down, nigga stay
You don't have the power
You don't tell me it's okay, I tell you that it's okay
You don't have the power
When I say down, nigga lay down, nigga stay

[Verse 2 - Malice]
So y'all think that y'all can run with us
Nigga, is your ones big enough, comin' in the sums big enough
When it's time to go to war, is your guns big enough?
Or are you minor league, shit, I call your bluff
You got tough talk, but your walk, feminine
We startin' out wit' full clips, then empty 'em
From a pair of still Siamese twins, that cripple men
We can handle this like outlaws to gentlemen
And I die for the love of the dough's my sentiment
But for now, we be invading your block and tenements
Opposite end of a Glock gun, power, you ain't got none
Comply wit' every word that I say, your only option
And by full right, send your ass in full flight
Running over niggas like stampedes in bullfights
Power in our relationship, oh so intimate
Our love is limitless, we caress and deep kiss
Money's my only bitch so I get the stash out
Got me whipped on this shit, eat her and lick the ass out
We gon' live like it ain't no tomorrow in this shit
I'm going to wallow in this shit, got her swallowin' my shit
Have wax and flames on her, whips and chains on her
Malice and Terrar, Neptunes, runnin' trains on her
My niggas all blunt it, with stacks and four-hundreds
With no remorse 'cause our money got blood on it

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Listen to my machine gun
Listen to my machine gun, don't try to run
Listen to my machine gun
Listen to my machine gun, don't try to run
Listen to my machine gun
Listen to my machine gun, don't try to run
Listen to my machine gun
Listen to my machine gun, don't try to run

[Hook]

[Bridge until fade]



[Malice]
I'm sayin life is crazy right
Shit is real wild
Like the realest shit ever, you know
Hold up, I'm comin, just let me bless this real quick, hold up
God, I ask that you continue to watch over us
I ask that you continue to bless us in the countless ways that you've done so
I ask that you walk with us on each and every encounter that we face
Cause life, as you know, can be a dirty game
But above all else right now God
I ask that may we not have to lose another one of our own to this game
May not another mother have to bury her son to this game
We've lost too many already
Lord, you know we're anything but heartless
I guess, what I'm saying right now Lord
Is that if these words hurt more than they help
I could only hope that you will have mercy upon our souls - Amen



[Hook - Pusha T]
All I want to do is ride around shining while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsches
Feel like a chuck wagon cause I'm on twelve horses
And the three behind mine they be the clique
So much ice in they Rollies, the shit don't tick man
Winter through the summer (whaaat) care less what it cost me
While I'm shovelin the snow man call me frosty lova

[Verse 1- Pusha T]
This for the 100,000 dollar kitty German drivers
With big rims and low-pro tires
Fuckin' with college bitches with innocent looks like Mýa
Corrupt they mind, turn 'em to liars, I groom 'em well
Dior whore, Christian Lacroix
Keep guns stashed under the floor board
Enough to start world war, paradise in reaches
Home next to beaches, hair pressed, blowin' in the wind
Shit 'bout long as Jesus, hostilely speaks the Gospel, so match this
Pusha push John P. Kees with these sounds of crackness, uh!
The black Martha Stewart, let me show you how to do it
Break down pies to pieces, make cocaine quiches
Money piles high as my nieces
Hefty bags full of cash, cars full of ass
Rolex presidential, bitch, feel the glass

[Hook]

[Verse 2- AB Liva]
It's that look that astounds
Life's a circus, I parade the 6 through these clowns
The crown is vacant, I'm takin' the proper steps
I'm takin' them Poppa steps, they prayin' for my downfall
Is it the bling, the king, conquistador
That my jeweler made the face blush on the Franck Muller
The R shape peculiar, it's awesome, layin' over dark skin
Lookin' like arson when I park in the left, it's constant
Minute hand is like Parkinson's
You a fish for the sharks to swim
In that opaque linen with the odd-colored stitchin'
V12 on the Modena, you can see the pistons
HREs on it, mami see it glisten
When I make Oliver Twist like Dickens
It's feelin' like parts is missin', tops don't push soul
Gotta drive it like pole positions 'til my soul is risen

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Malice]
Welcome to the world of Rollies, VS diamonds
And that 50,000 dollar show piece, got me shinin'
First nigga holla show me
Let that 9 millimeter turn a fella ghostly
Hell, I'll even grant amnesty to those who owe me
You fuckin' faggot, you need to raise your glass and toast me
Niggas can't figure the format for hustler criteria
Not chrome, chrome rims with stallion insignia
Listen youngin', you've only just begun
"You'll understand when you're older,: said father to the son
Who would've thought such riches stem from ill rhymes?
Canary yellow diamonds size of yield signs, slow down
And proceed with caution
Carousel of horses with dual-exhaustion, 'fess up
Youngin', you'll always be next up
Go against I, forever play catch-up, nigga

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Yuugh, ho I'm major, that shit nothing
Young nigga, old money, Benjamin Button
Seeing through your poker face, that nigga bluffing
Ladies going gaga for a nigga trying to fuck em'
Nickel plate tuck it, hesitate nothing
And I got the AR, why I like to bust it?
Why I need counseling? Why I won't discuss it?
Why I spend Donkey Kong knots in the mall like fuck it?
Pull up at the stop light, looking at this cop like
Yeah I drive big shit, naw my license ain't right
Still let the top drop back when it's sunny
Cause life ain't nothing but bitches and money

[Hook: Pharrell]
I don't know what is, it's something inside
I need that attention I just can't hide
Keep hearing these voices inside my mind
Saying fuck the rest, it's time to shine
I know that's how, the good ones died
But I need that risk, I need that drive
I'm stealing your bitch, I'm stealing your grind
Bitches sing this, and that's why I'm
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Old school Chevy wide body like a phantom
5 stars love but them haters can't stand em
UK money 150 thousand pounds
All-white Lamb sitting low to the ground
I just joined the game, the millionaire boys club
Gave me box of baking soda and skate board
I'm in the kitchen putting the work on steroids
Peeking out the blinds for the feds, I'm paranoid
Naw I ain't platinum, but how I'm a millionaire?
I know this a four door, so how it ain't no ceiling there?
Showing off little mama, going hard little daddy
Yo Gotti homeboy, and I'm a walking dope package

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Malice]
I'm from the era of letter to the better
They tell me rap change, well I'mma have to let her
Common loved her, I wish I never met her
They slutted her out, there's nothing left to treasure
Seems all I hear em say, "nigga where them dollars at?"
Here they go right here, tell them niggas holla back
Hit it then I quit it, then I step like a welcome mat
That 2010 got me feeling like I'm all of that
Re-Up Gang trinity, Liva, me and Pusha T
Got my money right, them haters tight like virginity
They don't understand how I feed off that energy
My table is prepared in the presence of my enemies

[Hook]



[Intro: Pusha T]
Yo-yo
You know I told you
You know I told you
I got a girl, ma
Yo, yo-yo
I got a girl, ma

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Kind of dramatic, her eye contact was sporadic
I stared so long that not to blink's really magic
Situation turned tragic, mission - undress
It seems for me to be a force of habit
Yo, the ill twist, my girl finds out
She'll slit her wrist, so play your position
You the stick girl to laugh at with my chick girl
The trick girl, tennis shoe after I hit girl
OK, your perspective connects with my objective
Soon together we'll make the form of collective
Collaborate, for my friends you'll have to masturbate
Another incentive just to ensure that you graduate
On to the next one and the next one, throughout the crew
To sever the ties between me and you
The lust turn to love, so push turn to shove
Out the door you gon' be, rain dance like a Comanche

[Hook: Pusha T]
Blowin up my pager while we at the spot
I told you, got a girl ma (ha, ha)
Don't be tappin on my shoulder while I'm at the bar
I told you, got a girl ma (ha, ha)
What you think she gonna disappear like voila?
Nah I told you, got a girl ma (ha, ha)
Wave your hands in the air if you feel the guitars
I know I told you, had a girl ma (ha, ha)

[Verse 2: Malice]
Yo, as a matter of fact, my girl type all that
So loud talk, making scenes, it can't be like that
Me and you spending time, how you see all that?
Did your friends say I got ends that stack?
Just because you got an ass that can clap like that
Don't mean you that fly that you can act like that
But you can be my stick though (stick girl)
What's good for me is also good for my click though
Cool 'less you front in the Soho, rockin logos, cause when you go low
Blow like I like on the mic singing solo
Malice hit the charts for rhyme and spine tappin
Never been the one for wine and dine action
Your attraction to me, strictly fashion
Ice outfit, looking like I'm an Alaskan
I'm askin, can we keep it on the DL?
And do how we do, no need to go into detail

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Stick girl, don't get your feelings involved, cause feelings get robbed
It's time for you to leave when I feel your heart throb
You rounding up your chicks, thinkin you bout to mob
You followin my car when you need to be at your job
Stick girl, this ain't nothin but a game to me
You angry but you got what you came to see
You couldn't break or bend me so you fell off track
Glaze over, time's up, ain't no room to react, stick girl...

[Verse 4: Malice]
You're not the misses, you're more like the mistress
Who be gettin fresh backseat of an LS
With the fellas, sharin' like fam, never jealous
You never done nothin like this, that's what you tell us
But bet you do the same for the next that whip a Lex'
I'm only down with sex that's safe and triple X
Sippin Vex in the moonlight, that get the mood right
Do it from the front or the back, whatever you like

[Hook] {X2}

[Outro: Pusha T]
Stick girl
Stick girl
Stick girl
I know I told you, had a girl ma (ha, ha)
Stick girl

[Hook]
From Taiwan to Texas, Lambos to Lexus
Diamonds in my necklace
Leave y'all bitches breathless
You don't want to test this
Burners leave you chestless
Thousand niggas restless
Do you get my message?!

[Verse - Pusha T]
Yo, choose your sides, we coming for the top
Y'all niggas bout to drop like fall guys
When I speak, all rise
Or get trampled over in Range Rovers with fog lights
Tonight's got a feel in the air, caused by they stare
And the spots that we walk, patrons whisper and glare
You know we coming minked out
Ears, neck and wrist freezed out
Looking like we robbed the Sphinx out
Haters in the back, you know they Cuban King'd out
Jealous as ever, we took the handmade link routes
Two vandals, twin calicos with pearl handles
Donuts, middle of street, in pink Lambos
Passenger seat, glanced at her feet, hot pink sandals
Sparking my heat, told me her name was Roman Candles
Yo, ya'll know who we are, you're looking at stars
Clipse are the ones breakin the law

[Hook]

[Verse - Malice]
Young guns bustin out, targa tops and drops
Sipping on Black Label lacing it with scotch
Ready or not we comin' at y'all, ready and cocked
With one shot, accurate hit with red dot
Ninety degrees, ninety-five speed, feeling the breeze
Ninja style, twelve-hundred CCs, travel in threes
We dabble in speed, poppin wheelies on the interstate
355 with fish gills, watch how they ventilate
My time radiate, my sons they got manners
They cock hammers, hear bout my dogs on cop scanners
Cat's wanna come to my clique, borrowin beats
But the Clipse got all this on lock, swallow the key
We plane hoppin, meanwhile y'all name dropping
Went from train hopping to diamond exchange shopping
Tank-topping wit links, ice dropping in drinks
Malice winning much, rocking the mink, what!

[Hook]

Yeah, who got it sewn up?
Who got a thousand on they side with signs that's thrown up
Shit, we got it blown up
While y'all take the bus our bitches is flown up
Four wheeling, popping hot bars at the ceilin
We cock back, auto-matics because it's thrillin
Ask yourself, you ready to try? you ready for I?
Assed out, mashed out bitch, get ready to die

[Verse - Malice]
It's wild how we fall up in pubs and night clubs
Ladies show love by giving back rubs in bathtubs
Switch that, backing the thugs wit black gloves cause they actors
Catching our slugs with fractures
Running wit thirty niggas who looking for where beef at
Clipse name come out they mouth, we make em see black
They blind in they third eye, my view is bird's eye
Malice eliminate every first, second and third guy

[Hook - repeat 2x]

[Verse 1: Malice]
Whether they gag me bound me hollow point round me
Dump me off the side of a bridge and drown me
Spare my family the details on how they found me
Vigil by candle light and gather round me
And talk about how I would lounge with fly women
How I was flossing in clubs in fine linen
Hopping in them ill whips with chrome spinning
Malice was true to the game for 9 innings
We love sinning but now I answer for that
Apologize to my fam I got you all dressing in black
A long line family and friends they signing in
My niece singing solo organs and violins
Wife in her black veil hands flooded with diamonds
Remaining calm under each arms my children
Daddys in a better place entering golden doors
With ivory all white pillars and marble floors
Brand new physical frame with no flaws
On my throne thats guarded by angels with 4-4's
Terrar retaliate show em how real it be
A split second 'fore you blazed they probably thought you was me
Returning on some Crow shit let em know shit
They mess with the wrong click quick to blow shit
Yall know who owned this so they end my career
But still I put my tag on this earth Malice was here

[Hook] x2
Take a walk on my side
No more tears no more fears no more telling me lies
I only want cheers and heartfelt goodbyes
My death march is here tell me whos gonna ride

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Hold me high Gucci suit and tie
Let my casket reach the sky tell my girl don't cry
Just sing me a lullaby and let the white doves fly
Cuz I heard from a bird its only sleep when you die
Break me in unison outside right thru the lens
My mother cried cuz she knew that I was only true to sin
Celebrate my passing with gun shots and systems blasting
Blown up posters of Terrar held by children laughing
No matter how foul my burial open casket
Now simply so they can see my clusters and my diamonds smiling
Im sorry I failed only cuz the ones I left were so real
For me my doggs will lie, die, shoot, cry, or kill
First to Malice sorry that I left you half in a hole
But now you'll write for both of us ill channel thoughts thru your soul
Emmanuel remember this when you see my nemesis
Drop my picture on his chest and make his family reminisce
Revenge so sweet and I crush you with the heat
Your the first one I call when its time to put em to sleep
Now Pharrell grand dragon horns stabbing the skys
Turn Magnum, laser tag em couldn't sever all ties
My final request on the day im laid to rest
Take my body to the ocean and have a water front ves'
This will be my burial this eulogy will be in stereo
Blue Angels will draw my face in smoke during an aerial

[Hook] x4

[Hook]
I got jewels, plus wheels
Pullin up in your grill, I'm so trill
Your girl want Cosmos, Cristeels
And she feelin around for them pills
Bitch I'm trill, Bitch I'm so trill
Nigga I'm trill, Nigga I'm so trill
I got, my steel, I'll peel
Pulling up on your grill, I'm so trill
Your girl want Cosmos, Cristeels
And she feeling around for them pills
Bitch I'm trill, bitch I'm so trill
Nigga I'm trill, nigga I'm so trill

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
G's up, rev them V's up
Federales trying to reach us to keep us
Flooded pieces, diamond size Reese's Pieces
You know who he is
Nigga talk show like Regis, King Push flow prestigious
Hoes suck me like leeches
X and Os, tick-tack-toes
Fuck 'em, duck 'em, let them go, on to the next
Got this in the decks of them Cali low-lows
Houston, candy paint, screwed up vocals
New York, Range Rov, sit on Mo-Mos
Pusha in that Bentley, G-T-Oh No
Flow chameleon, worth bout a million
Sell Bolivian, Feds in oblivion
Bitch Brazilian, purse reptillian
Took her from far off island like Gilligan

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Malice]
It's me ma, you ain't dreamin
Star struck bitch damn near stopped breathing
So real that hon' ain't believin
Out my bracelet she can't make rhyme or reason
Soon as you get your heart involved
That's when I fall back love, au revoir
So international, French Riviera
Love for foreign cars would explain my Carrera
Who cares when these fools talk?
Don't mean jack til that tool gotta talk
Icy wrists help me to cool off
And the second hand on this bitch it moon walk
Reminds me of how I applied myself
And why I now ride with Tiptronic help
Bankroll on overload
I eeny meeny miny moe them hoes, I'm so trill

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
So many different things make me trill
Start with that 'B' with wings over the grill
Maybe how my way with words make me mills
Or maybe it's my way with birds digital skills
Young, restless, talk so reckless
Two hundred thousand up in my necklace
Four of ya Hummers wrapped round my neck bitch
I ain't mention the Rolly red-neck like Texas

[Verse 4: Malice]
To y'all ill-wishers who wanna take part
In me getting robbed, well follow ya heart
And I'll waste ya, hell I raised ya
Even let 'em cheat from my paper
Why does wealth make them hate me
And make chicks hearts so achy breaky
Rarely do I toot my own horn
But y'all fellas got too far gone, now come back

[Hook]

[Beat rides till fade then fireworks go into Chinese New Year]



[Pharrell]
You ready to do this, nigga?
You ready to come down here?
It's Virginia, nigga...
We do this in broad daylight...
It's a whole different degree of homicide, nigga...
You ready?

[Hook: Pusha T & (Pharrell]
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook
Pack it up, sell it triple-price, fuck the books
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look

[Verse 1 - Pusha T]
In my "Home Sweet Home" I keep chrome next to my bones
Alters my walk to limpin'
Since I love the feel, I guess I'm passionately pimpin'
It 'tis what it seems
That thing imprintin' through the seams of my jeans, by all means
Lost it all, from lives to love
But my faith and my money helped me rise above
See I turned to the Lord when them times got tough
Bullied through streets, powder I pushed and shoved
In that ol' Virginny
Out of ten niggas, nine are guinea
No money, all they know is gimme, got semis waitin'
Heat like Caribbean summers, I been there
Each year, a diffferent bitch wonder
Who wing she gon' fall under, Push' or Mal'
Gonz or Grimes, wit' me, with thoughts of fuckin' them cross her mind
Look ma, that's right up my alley
I love my family, I want them all happy
In Virginia, we smirked at that Simpson trial
Yeah, I guess the chase was wild
But what's the fuss about?
See, plenty my partners feelin' like O.J
Beat murder like the shit is OK, that's what our dough say
Talk the evil that men do, I'm lost in the mental
I miss you Shampoo, we miss you Shampoo
And your grams, too...

[Hook]
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook
Pack it up, sell it triple-price, fuck the books
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look

[Verse 2 - Malice]
Seem like they all got a comment to make
In regards to my paper, now they guessin' my weight
They fast to predict the outcome of my fate
Wonderin' 'bout Clipse and if they got what it take
"Malice, he think he hard, tough guy of the clique
And Pusha, he walk around like he swear he the shit"
You right on both counts, bitch, Clipse is us
And there are some things that you don't discuss
Don't ask me 'bout the Neptunes and what's they fare
Don't ask about the loud screamin' chick with the hair
Don't ask about my music, and how that's comin' 'bout
Don't ask about my album, or when's it comin' out
Cause I feel like you really being funny on the sly
Now face down, layin' on your tummy, or you die
I tried being humble, humble get no respect
Now the first sign of trouble, that's a hole up in your neck
Plus, what I look like spendin' my nights in jail
I could never be a thug, they don't dress this well
I reside in VA, ride in VA
Most likely when I die, I'm gon' die in VA
Virginia's for lovers, but trust there's hate here
For out-of-towners, who think that they gon' move weight here
Ironic, the same same place I'm makin' figures at
That there's the same land they used to hang niggas at, in Virginia

[Hook]
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook
Pack it up, sell it triple-price, fuck the books
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look

[Pharrell]
Young'n... (Talk about, what?)
This is real, young'n... (Talk about, what?)
You lookin' into a whole different world, young'n (Talk about, what?)
This is real...
Live...



[Hook: Slim Thug (Pusha)]
Man, I showed up, pimpin' ya cold up
I head straight to the bar just to post up
I roll the 'dro up, my cup Mo'ed up
Bitch, don't just stand there with your nose up
C'mon, wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?) Ha
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?) Ha
Wamp wamp, what it do?

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
No hotta, flow droppa since Poppa
You penny-ante niggas, see ,I know copper
Left the game on a high note, flow opera
Pusha still got them keys, I can unlock ya
See that watch on the sleeve? Call it "show-stopper:
Nigga ball around the world, call me globe trotter
Trick dollar, ask what I feel? Nada
Give a bitch yellow fever, all these gold bottles
And late models, I lean throttles
Roof back with the coupe black, playa think he need goggles
Look mama, a mí, fly papa
Strictly Bathing Ape, Ice Cream and BBC rocker, yuugh!
So proper, hammer time, gun cocker
Top shotta, me hesitate none, pop ya
Egg shell on the scale for my snow coppers
Don't ask what I sell, shit, I'm Bet' Crocker

[Hook: Slim Thug (Pusha)]
Man, I showed up, pimpin' ya cold up
I head straight to the bar just to post up

Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?) Ha
Ha, wamp wamp, what it do?

[Verse 2: Malice]
Uh, mirror mirror, who's the fairest?
Tricked a buck fifty on that horse and carriage
Must admit, nothing like these carats
Them hoes holla back just like they parrots
Down to the watches, alligator strap
Six different time zones, I don't set her back
17 a brick, yeah, run and tell 'em that
I got the wamp wamp, when I move it, it's still damp
Mildew-ish when I heat it, it turn bluish
It cools to a tight wad, the Pyrex is Jewish
I get paper, it seems I get foolish
Take it to Jacob and play "Which hue's the bluest?"
We ain't browsing, luxurious housing
Pull up so mean with the angel bowing
Or with the emblem bearing the stallion
European custom, the leather's Italian

[Hook: Slim Thug (Pusha)]
Man, I showed up, pimpin' ya cold up
I head straight to the bar just to post up
I roll the 'dro up, my cup Mo'ed up
Bitch don't just stand there with your nose up
C'mon, wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?) Ha
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?) Ha
Wamp wamp, what it do?

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Yuugh! So much glamour, that I can't stand the
Bright from the ice, the chain xenon lamp ya
Impression in ya mind like a freeze-frame camera
The white tape tight like ya seen on Pampers
What's under the couch probably freeze up Santa
Whatever it cost, baby, we got answers
Line outside full of Jo-Jo Dancers
"We Got it for Cheap," that's the Re-Up anthem

[Verse 4- Malice]
By far the coldest, '06 Lotus
0 to 60, "hocus pocus"
The feds don't know so they stick they noses
While we off the coast, proposing toasts-es
Hoes and more shit, the family close knit
And deep like the Hutu, you cockroaches
Just like the flow, the fours ferocious
I tuck you in, homie, "Buenos noches"

[Hook: Slim Thug (Pusha)]
Man, I showed up, pimpin' ya cold up
I head straight to the bar just to post up
I roll the 'dro up, my cup Mo'ed up
Bitch, don't just stand there with your nose up
C'mon, wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?) Ha
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?) Ha
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)



[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Lord, I've seen em comin
Please don't take my breath away from me while I'm runnin
They got me jumpin, from these slugs that they gunnin
Simple and plain, it ain't a game no more, they headhuntin
Listen, Lord, I'm scared, fearin for dead
I'm racin with these hollow points which slip past my head
Who ever said that life's easy? Come teach me Lord
Cause it's the only way for you to reach me
So - many - nights - I've - cried
So - many - times - I've - lied
So - many - of mine - have died
But I - still keep you - inside
Lord, help me get away, give me some wings
So I can fly away, please don't let my family cry today
No longer am I choosin the wrong over the right away
Anything you say, just show me a brighter day, huh?

[Hook] X2
My eyes are so scarred
Blind, so I go hard
No matter the robbery
I hope he watches over me

[Verse 2 Malice]
Lord, I never asked you for none of this
Now I'm contemplatin' suicide, how it come to this?
Lord, please explain what we livin in
How I know right from wrong but still choose livin in sin
Lord, if this a test, can you tell me that
Will I pass or at the end will I feel your wrath?
I try to do right but the wrong always held me back
My moms tell me this but the flack tell me that
Lord, listen, I know you see the way we act up
With no remorse for the cats who got clapped up
I told them once, turned around, even told them twice
Tried to let em live but by the third it was nothin nice
Lord, is there a clue that you can send me
To help me out just so that you don't condemn me?
What would you have done had you would've been me
How was I to know money bred envy? Uh

[Hook] X2

[Verse 3: Malice]
Lord, how do I live in a world that is so insane?
With little joy but there's double pain
I know you gonna see everything that's on my brain
And I don't make the rules, I only play the game
And I'ma win, lying, cheating or stealing
If robbing means that I'm eating, I will
If I gotta live this life then I'm packin a steel
Survival of the fittest and I go for the kill

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
Uh, Lord, if you want then I will listen in
Temptation is a bitch, diamonds be glistenin
It's like the Devil be comin up and kissin men
Had Terrar out there hustling, missling
When I speak, you don't always respond back
Right now, you got me waiting on the call back
Lord, I beg that you don't ever let me fall back
Regardless what I do, you know where my heart's at right?

[Hook] X2



[Intro: Mr. Lee]
Ayyy, papá
Re-Up Gang Records
That hold-the-door music
You know, Broadway, daddy
Monteca, crack, hooray
(*speaking Spanish*)
Uptown baby, otra vez
Clipse, Hell Hath No Fury, b
Let em know, daddy, Mr. Lee!

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fear him, as soon as you hear him
Upon my arrival, the dope dealers cheer him
Just like a revival, the verse tends to steer 'em
Through a life in the fast lane, I German engineer 'em
No serum can cure all the pain I've endured
From crack to rap to back to selling it pure
For every record I potentially sell in the store
It's like Mecca to the dealer that's selling it raw
So many deceive ya
I'm more in touch with the keys, move over Alicia
I force feed ya the metric scale
Rap's like child's play, my show and tell
Within each verse you see the truth's unveiled
They manufacture proof as they lie to themselves
Puppets on the string like a yo-yo
Bouncing like a pogo, they praying I never go solo

[Hook]
We got it for cheap

[Interlude: Mr. Lee]
Do it! I fuck wit the real niggas, daddy
Fuck these bitch-ass niggas
(*speaking Spanish*)
They just wanna be you, loco!
Fucking ambicioso
(*more Spanish*)

[Verse 2- Malice]
The wool's removed and now I see
My leg was pulled, the joke's on me
So heartbreakin, like lovin a whore
Might hurt ya once, but never no more
It's like tryin to fly but they clippin your wings
And that's exactly why the caged bird sings
Who can nickname it? The shame rings true
Seems to me reparations are overdue
I done been to the top, I done sipped the juice
And with that being said, bird crumbs'll never do
Even on my last, not a penny in the bank
I'ma stand on my own, so thanks, but no thanks
Keep the pranks as I bid farewell
I gotta answer to Marcus and Jennelle
And to little brother Terrence who I love dearly so
If ever I had millions, never would you push blow, never

[Hook]

[Interlude: Mr. Lee]
Ay, dios mío! Maldicioso!
And here comes that, "Oh no, daddy!"
Entiende! (*Spanish*)
Everyone must pay now!
(*more Spanish*)
Re-Up Gang Records
It's your game now, daddy

[Verse 3:  Pusha T]
I'm the best since he died, and he lied
The spirit of competition, one verse could start jihad
CPR Pusha, the flow tends to revive
Pullin the covers back, I expose what you disguise
My presence is felt, the pressure is on
A 4'11" Cuban helped us weather the storm
Pyrex and powder, it was back to the norm
Through all the adversity, the fury was born

[Verse 4: Malice]
Niggas don't get the picture, it's written in scripture
Even ask your mama, she'll tell you that blood's thicker
And I don't know how them other niggas built
And I don't know if ever they feel guilt
Or maybe niggas just too high on they stilts
But this one's on me, I'ma view it as spilt milk
Grandma, look at me, I'm turnin the other cheek
It's the R-E-U-P G-A-N-G

[Hook]

[Outro: Mr. Lee]
From the street to this música
We get this money, we never stop
Record sales? Digital scales? It's whatever
We always at home
Hell Hath No Fury
(*speaking Spanish*)
Mr. Lee!



[Intro: Pharrell]
(Get down!)
Niggas and bitches (Get down!)
You are now listening to... (Get down!)
The real... (Get down!)
And that would be... (Get down!)
Clipse, the Neptunes... (Get down!)
And the new label... (Get down!)
Staaaarrr Traaaak...

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Top down, chrome spinning
You see the boss grinning
I'm loving these damn women
I let two get in
She tried to let the rest fit in
I'm like, "Naw love, that's forbidden"
I ain't for squishing, that's a problem to the wheel well
Trust I know them 20's real well
Now we coasting, me, two chicks, and toasting
I turn up the volume, watch the bass get 'em open
Soft spoken, with a wild side
I love 'em in the ride, they lovin' the ride
We was moving bodies before we hit the party
Before the DJ started cutting (I was already fucking)
Cinderella'd you girls; from nothing to something
Hit the parking lot, hear the club system thumping
Lose the face, you two's was great
But it's to the V.I.P., I got new moves to make

[Hook: Pharrell]
When the last time you heard it like this?
Smoke something, drink something, get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl
Only if you know you live
From the club to the parking lot
How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie

[Verse 2: Malice]
Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be in the back tipsy
We gets in for free—"Ay, they with me"
Two stepping, you see each crew repping
Slipping on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweating
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on
I like that ma, you do something to me
Come this way and prove something to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose
I'm open, but naw, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm toting
But I'm only here to party, y'all
Carry every weekend like it's Mardi Gras

[Hook: Pharrell]
When the last time you heard it like this?
Smoke something, drink something, get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl
Only if you know you live
From the club to the parking lot
How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie

[Bridge: Pharrell + Kelis in background]
Yo, you are now listening to the sounds
That are vibrating your speakers
Please do not be alarmed
It will not hurt you at all
For it is the real
For all my real niggas and bitches

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
When they say "last call" it don't mean the night's over
It mean it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the chocha
S&M chick, asked Pusha to choke her
But I thought about how rich I am and said, "No sir"
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What did it the whip appeal, or my baby face?

[Verse 4: Malice]
The night's still young and I'm already leaning
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-2's gleaming
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen
I pull up, let her get in, she know from the beginning
She added to the list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinning and my head spinning
Mine from juice and gin and hers from neck and chin and
I'm a winner, man

[Hook 2X: Pharrell]
When the last time you heard it like this?
Smoke something, drink something, get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl
Only if you know you live
From the club to the parking lot
How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie



[Hook - Pusha-T & (Malice)]
Look - you ain't dealin wit no child's toy
I'm a wild cowboy (yo I'm a wild cowboy)
Yet you walk around town with them real aisle toys
Your best bet, recognize my style boy
Cause I'll tap your back (and let that be that)

[Verse - Markita]
If I had a nine or a twenty-two, it wouldn't make a difference
Close range or up on the roof at long distance
Using a scope, tie up your family using a rope
Dump you in the river with weights, you won't float
Abusing your folks, one of the methods
You get the message, probably take about a week before they find the records
So pay up or it's a, beef forever
Till I get the dough it's gon' be like we we're glued together
So what you think it can't happen to you?
Cause I'm a broad? till I start clapping at you
Pull out the sword take a couple steps turn around like a western
Spin one-eighty degrees, squeeze off, blow your chest in
Weigh shots by the units, bang this opportunist
You want war, I'm quick on draw, like cartoonists
It's two kinds of people, the haves and have nots
The ones that punch clocks or those wit stash spots
See I got the cash locked when I spit the hot verse
The rules of the game, is to get the drop first
Oh, you don't get it? well you will when I spit it
Divine exquisite, connected like consitics
I eat, sleep and shit it, surprise the critics
Wit a flow that defies all the laws of physics
Wages of sin, give me a shank and two cases of gin
My patience is thin, wild gals think the places of men

[Hook - Pusha-T & (Malice)]
Look - you ain't dealin wit no child's toy
I'm a wild cowboy (yo I'm a wild cowboy)
Yet you walk around town with them real aisle toys
Your best bet, recognize my style boy
Cause I'll tap your back (and let that be that)
Look - you ain't dealin wit no child's toy
I'm a wild cowboy (yo I'm a wild cowboy)
Yet you walk around town with them real aisle toys
Your best bet, recognize my style boy

[Verse - Malice]
I told them like this, give it up and don't resist
The name Malicious and my aim don't miss
A hollow tip in the clip with his name on it
Thought he had a parade till we rained on it
Now it's the final lap, move to slow
Tried to react, my final tap a spinal tap ball in his back
We never chance em, get the ransom, ambulance em
All or Nothing, my motto and anthem
I gotta watch my back, cause these niggas is hungry
Got the good, bad and ugly wantin to slug me
We roll out and tear the city up
Wild cowboys moving along, giddy up, what's up
And we can buck til the sunset
Pick em off one by one, havin fun yet?
We got money to get and there's hoes to lust
Ain't enough room in this town for the both of us, fuck
You see we pulling toasters, out the holsters
Wanted dead or alive, my face on posters
We come to collect debts, roll wit twin tecs
All the chrome fours spinning on my index

[Bridge]
And for all niggas that study
Neptunes beats till they go nutty
Make you say what the fucky
Gonna do what my Glock busty
Make the cops wonder where the older went like Tussy

[Verse - Pusha-T]
You're gonna need your best five to tangle with suicide
Boy, you vs I, however it's do or die
Who are you to question my presence like who am I
Name Terrar, now the new question is who's to try
No one, put two up in em the slow gun
Turn his face so our eyes don't meet, he know something
That nigga flow something, his money it grow something
But come at him sideways in the street, he'll blow something
Fuck your temple, I gotta make my mark, that's too simple
I'd rather hit him once in each cheek, leave him with dimples
So if the bitch live, he'll walk around with my stencil
And if the bitch die, outline him in chalk pencil
Everything flooded, we star-studded celestial
Space Ghost flow, extra-terrestrial
If ya'll can't hear me, increase the decibel
When we talk money, exclude the decimal bitch!

[Hook - repeat 4x]



[Intro - Malice]
Clip niggas
It's not a game, Star Trak
It's like that, what, check it
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1 - Malice]
It's the final curtain, we black masks and black turbans
Lightin' up the sky in a black Suburban
We on the late night streetsweep, hit at least three
The price you pay and it ain't cheap, make his frame leak
When we speak, our dialogue consist of flame heat
Cop the brick, flipped it twice and all in the same week
Flee the sirens, hit the highlands, or the islands
All up in the loft with some chick from Thailand
Cause you ain't lived 'til you empty clips, whip the cyclone
With enough chips for one crib in each time zone
Parted us for the sea floors and started street wars
Bet a detour from this block and try and keep yours
Cause if down here, we play not, niggas get got
Sendin' two through his red drop, make his post stop
How we roll is wit' no smiles, shit get so foul
Then we sit four to fifty split 'round table style

[Hook x2]
You can't touch me, I got scuds, love, wit' no lens
Clipse with bricks for buildin' pyramids
The beginnin' is my end, nigga, fuck friends
Bills, hundreds, thousands, what's tens

[Verse 2 - Nako]
Nigga, we comin' for ya
Four deep in the Explorer
Poetic torture, enchanted tails of horror
Fuck what they taught ya, my torture scorches all sorts of
Individuals with chambers Hannibal thought of
Which nigga careful enough to stick me
They treat me like AIDS, they scared to get me
Too shook to get wit' me
To get me, mission's impossible, I got an arsenal
Of Glocks for any obstacle that you can imagine possible
Nako flow, kill slow, like carbon mo-
-noxide, tear your block high, burn his toxide
We're like the jocks side, Clipse, Virginia niggas
We live for figures, we killas, who injure critters
What ya'll wanna do now
Got two Glocks, that's bustin' too loud
Nickel plate with no silencers
Known to move crowds, verbal liquid
Stick wit', them herds you live wit'
Cause this is too explicit for you bitch-es

[Hook x1]

[Verse 3 - Lee Harvey]
Gray race coupe, being chased by state troops
Four blockin' and escape routes, firm grip knowing he's Jake Shoop
Check the rear view, A.J's tailgatin' and V-shaped
Handcuff the briefcase, whip's stolen, plus it need plates
Stole the coke out, exchange shots, windows broke out
All or nothing, two guns, both of them smoked out
Tire blow out, slight spins 'til it don't end
On length of one side, sparks fly ridin' on rims
High adrenaline, accident as if surrendin'
A quick desperate attempt, sixteen, sendin' the wind
Flee on foot now, German Shepherds trackin' my steps
Helicopter overhead, I look up, slappin' my chest
Show I lack respect, runnin' hard through crowded streets
We have you surrounded special agents shot at the freeze
Fuck nah, I'mma die like Christ, inside my fate
Try my best to empty both clips, sayin' goodbyes with hate

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4 - Pusha T]
Yo, yo, we travel, wit' drugs in the dashboard
And flee from the task force
Quit hollerin' 'bout your ones
You got guns, nigga blast yours
Space is no remorse, mind cluttered wit' thoughts
Young'ns out like I-95's, they only cost
Caught up in the fame comes along with the street game
Don't forget about them head hunters, head hunting your name
Cause they seen and heard how niggas flyin' chicks in
Half-black, half-Hawaiian, believe my dick's in
Do what they lust for the dough, it's sickenin'
Mr. Claus to these bitches
So my dogs play Dancer, Prancer and Vixen
These cheap coke niggas got me actin' irate
Enough fake on they blow to fuckin, spark a debate
Turn violent, eternal silence equals they fate
Cause they tried to get over, those niggas stepped on my weight
Now it's time for slug love, thug love too physical
I need to ensure everybody's condition's critical
Terrar no mask is up, your family tie is strong
We'll, make 'em say your name three times, then blast on
Camaraderie, second to none like magnets
React first, think last, lay you in caskets
At any point we fallen off
Got you hustlers screamin' "call 'em off"
We runnin' through your town, in prescowns, dripped over sawed offs
Drug habits, opposite end, we full of sin
Compare ones, pull guns, to separate mice from men

[Hook x2]



[Intro - Pharrell]
I can run with you? (Yeah)
I know you don't know me
But um, don't you notice, like
Everyone keeps on looking at us (come on)
You know why (come on)
Let me tell you why, Oh!

[Verse 1 - Pusha T]
Seen set, yeah, my team set
Niggas bleem so hard they say we seem wet
Safe in the club, never seen me sweat
Nextel on my right, hand is on my left
Hot mama freeze, I like what I see
Is it asking too much for you to talk to me
Hit the dance floor, share a spark with me
Oh, grab a booth seat in the dark wit' me
Oh, you on that tough shit, play hard to get
Guess you didn't know I ain't the one to fuck wit'
Came a little harder, until I touched it
Or be your worst nightmare making you loveless
See I'm in the faster lane, baby I master game
Chicks like porno flicks, they all the same
Tap into they ego, just to own the brain
Then keep 'em at arms-length and still callin' my name, Terrar

[Hook - Pharrell & Pusha T]
You don't even know what you lookin' at
Real niggas that'll push ya' back
You ain't got no defense when I scream attack
I can tell, I can tell
You don't even know what you lookin' at
Real niggas that'll push ya' back
You ain't got no defense when I scream attack
I can tell, I can tell

[Verse 2 - Malice]
I had you locked from the interlude
Talking 'bout how you hot, now you in the mood
Pictured you in your friend, y'all in the nude
Only cause I'm sure you know that the Clipse gon' blow like innertubes
Works for me, got you beggin' for mercy
Pillow-talk all in my ear like Kermy
Keep shoving cause I'm lovin' the way that you work me
Been on since I seen your performance in Jersey
But worthy tricks be not, tips we got
It's only right to charm, run game, but play me not
The way we rock, y'all don't know about this
Come around your block in the rimmed out Six
Tented out windows cause for poked out lips
But hatin' on the Clipse get y'all nowhere quick
My whole clique flossin' our shit like dope dealers
Five deep bustin' off heat on four wheelers

[Hook]

[Bridge - Kelis]
When the shots go across the room
Who you gon' call when you lost in doom
Your second's too late, we react too soon
Star Trak, Clipse and the Neptunes
When the shots go across the room
Who you gon' call when you lost in doom
Your second's too late, we react too soon
Star Trak, Clipse and the Neptunes

[Verse 3 - Malice]
Haters I suggest y'all quick to get back
Nine double M, them rounds we spit that
Cold red fill 'em with lead put 'em to bed
Bloodshed one in the head, one in the red
I can tell you hatin' cause your face balled up
Simply because my neck and wrist iced all up
But y'all should be inspired men and wake y'all up
And prepared you to look like I won't break y'all up

[Pusha T]
Haters stand by, wit' yo' hands high
Got clips for y'all clique ready to fry
Now you ask why, beggin' for my reply
Don't talk, save it for the man in the sky
You just a go-getter, who ain't no better
Same, no sweater, pocket with no cheddar
A chromed-out baretta, Ferrari, Giuletta
Wrong move you lose, Clipse comin' to get 'cha

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Pharrell]
Star Trak {*heavy breathing*}
Your heart go {*heavy breathing*}
Your heart go {*heavy breathing*}
Everybody go {*heavy breathing*}

[Hook]



[Hook: Pharrell]
Mmm I'mma tell you what I'm talkin bout
When I was a young boy
My momma always told me don't take no shit
Motherfucker hit you then you better hit 'em back
So when I hit the nigga it go blam
A nigga out of line

[Verse 1 - Malice]
Back when I was 'bout Big Wheels and race tracks
Pops pushed a Tornado and rolled to eight tracks
Never stood a chance, exposed from way back
Lying to the baby, saying its Ajax
I was 'bout four when I walked past that door
That shoulda been closed where I first witnessed the raw
See in my household it was quite unique
Playing hide and seek you might find a key
Caught glimpse accidental, it branded my mental
Pals my role model in that Lincoln Continental
Bought all my friends Icees, it was 'bout six
And when he pulled off I was like, "See told ya we was rich."
How I turned out let it be no surprise
When they speak of cousin Ricky it brings tears to their eyes
See, my family got a history of hustlers
Lil' brother, big brother, mother to grandmother
It's tradition

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Pusha T]
My momma didn't see it coming, my daddy was there
What's my excuse? Cartoons were the root
Started with Yosemite Sam with the gun in
Palm of each hand, what couldn't I demand?
See, thirteen, studied the gangsta's lean
Low brim, no smile, lotta cash meanwhile
Daddy had the Chrysler Fifth Avey
Hustlers on the blocks cars were aero-dynamie
With ghetto paint jobs, Mango M3s
Seventeen inch B-Bs riding tough
The bike was Huffy, attention was froze
In a twenty five cent frozen cup laid my soul
The streets had made the mold
Since fourteen holding, Pusha T was chosen
Rebel like Che Guevara
RC Tyco versus Carrera, it's P

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Malice]
I think of grandma and the weight she would foot 'em
She kinda remind me of Madame Queen in Hoodlum
Sport the grandkids, each one she would treasure
Said she kept two guns and to do so was a pleasure
The cigarette dangle forty-five degree angle
Still every bit a lady but you don't wanna tangle
Let that explain me and how I got involved
Young'ns hustling in the Creek, me, Jon-Jon and Jamal

[Verse 4 - Pusha T]
Age fifteen, walking through the hallway
Plate the new Jordans, first ones on the scene
See I could afford 'em, living out a dream
Hustler on the rise, laces untied
Slid past young'ns, couldn't break my stride
Didn't know I was knotted in street ties
Teachers askin' how and why
Bitches passing by: "Oh my, he's so gangsta"

[Hook]

[Intro: Adrian Younge + Common]
Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Gluttony, baby
Is us, it's hard to see
It's knocking
Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Man, they gon', they gon'
Man they gon' knock this
And ride out to this

[Verse]
It sit deep in my chest, so let me express
Grew up on 868, oh, y’all don’t need the address
It was ‘round CVS, we were so devious
The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest
The streets was a mess, and they still are
Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed
But the game is the game, so let it begin
In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins
Now, the first is pride, though some call it vanity
A hustler's insanity can break up the family
Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change
Knowing that he'll end up in a grave
It's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans
Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting
Like the second is something we all have
Or felt, than Cain or Khan, it's called wrath
I seen a boss take it out on his staff
Seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath
Never seen a man making money while he mad
So hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math
Now the third, you probably heard from MOP
They say use them rocks to make 'em envy
Envy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it's a felony
When niggas fucking with you [?] commit infidelity
They hate it, to see you celebrated
Counting my paper, nigga, you could have made it
Let me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth
Where niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth
Want you to break em off, getting money it costs
For you to be a boss, ain't no taking off
Now the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat
It’s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street
It’s a dude that’s getting paid in full, cars and jewels
So his plate is full, but the way this nigga move
He is never full and he gon' want your food
Don't overdo it, that's an underrated rule
The sixth is a fix that's in all of us
When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust
When the drawers go down, the guards go down
Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now
Okay, the seventh is a seed that many believe
Is the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed
Knew some cousins that was hustlin', one of em ended up bustin' the other
Greed is a mother, it’s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff
Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off
Before I sign off, in the sins we livin'
The good thing is we can be forgiven

[Outro]
Seven deadly sins



[Verse 1: Common]
Living in a glass bubble, the fast hustle
The masked struggle that I'm in, the same one that you in
I knew inside when I was outside on the south side
Had to take it a step further the way that Ralph tried
Oh that's my stepfather
He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors
For the perfect picture, I forgot to pose
Used to rock Jabos and go out with bros
Tryna get lots of hoes till I got exposed
To a bigger picture called free, in the picture, it was me
Al-Hajj Malik Shabazz, Muhammad, and Noble Drew Ali
A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000
Telling me what I can't be
But you can't paint me
Black is the color of my true love spirit and I do love lyrics
And I used to love Harold's Chicken and I dance pretty good
And I feel at home in the hood and I get lit in the club
Still I love

[Hook: Syd Tha Kyd]
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom

[Verse 2: Common]
If you hear this rhyme, it's coming from division 9
The toughest in Cook County
They count me out cause I did a crime
They say it's violent time in human beings
But being they ain't seeing me as human
In this big business called prison, I'm the one that's consuming
Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me
Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones
I wasn't raised to love guns, well maybe toy ones
My pops, y'all built and destroyed him
With prescriptions of poverty, dope, and unemployment
When will we see enjoyment?
I smile when my little boy get to visit for about 30 minutes
But we ain't never spent Christmas together, tryna get it together
What I'ma do when I get out? I don't know what it is to live out
Just reminiscing of the big house, I'm the one justice chose to spit out
My life story is written in a prison sentence
Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness?
Still I love

[Hook: Syd Tha Kyd]
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom

[Outro: Bilal]
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free, make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free, make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah



[Instrumental]

[Outro: woman speaking]
He was a big guy from Tyler, Texas... and... uh I think we walked in the class one day and we passed each other... and he was country, country so he was like... "Heyyy lil mama"... and I giggled... I was like, "Heyyyyy"



[Verse 1: Common]
Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speaks
I'm keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek
I seeking it with em, I'm dope the streets need me to hit em
With some of that (revolutionary rap)
Revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guise pack heat enough to bury June, on my feet
I'm getting married soon, walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifthteens of the jeep that you boom
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Oshun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building I'm the doorman, opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors, tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine
In the age of aquarius

[Hook: Bilal & Erykah Badu]
The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes ( du-du ba ba ba)
Aquarius! (echoes)

[Verse 2: Common]
Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say im slept on, now im bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends, I flow over water thats as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
Im rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replinish the Earth
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first
We in the age of Aquarius...

[Hook x2]

Aquarius! x2

[in progress...]



[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse]
I want to be as free as the spirits of those who left
I'm talking Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yusef
Through death grew conception, new breath and resurrection
For moms, new steps in a direction
In the right way, told her, "Inside is where the fight lay
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say"
Chicago nights they, stay on the mind
But I write many lives, they, lay on these lines
Wavin' signs of the times, many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme
Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise, I look into my daughter's eyes
And realize I'ma learn through her
The Messiah, might even return through her
If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz, Gramps wantin 'em
Demons and old friends, Pops, they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Walk like warriors, we were never told to run
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Never looking back, or too far in front of me
The present is a gift, and I just want to be



[Verse 1]
She rested her head upon my chest
Sensed liberation in between breaths
Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We layed under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard trying to understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill from her grille
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me hold me, a story she assembled it
Tellin' it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love makin'
When she was eight she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Her soul was tired and never really rested
Only with men through aggression
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom between me and you

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Serenade her, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me

[Verse 2]
She laid, I watched her breathe
Happy to be here, not afraid to leave
I couldn't concieve her not being here
Death in her face her not having fear
Less than a year she was diagnosed with it
Memories of that year, so close and vivid
Happiness, would only visit, once in a while
To watch an adult, becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
The life of one so given early would God take it?
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
I stare with my eyes closed
Wonder when the body leave does the mind go
Watchin' Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors theres no cure
We went through doubt, and cases of insure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
Knew a part of her I could heal with words
But the creator was sending for her
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death between me and you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
A lump in his throat, his fear built
My whole life it was instilled
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
This is how real life's supposed to be?
For it to happen to someone close to me?
So far we'd come, for him to tell me
As he did, insecurity held me
I felt like he failed me
Till his spirit yelled help me
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
About going pro we dreamed together
Never knew it would turn out like this
For so long he tried to fight this
Now it was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him? Had to accept him if I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself between me and you

[Hook]

Liberation, peace



[Verse 1: Common]
Here we go, here, here we go again
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mothers' stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other, it's part of the plot
I wish the hating will stop (war!) and the battle with us
I know that Black Lives Matter, and they matter to us
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation, mass incarceration
Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony or a misdemeanor?
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us
We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers
The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar
And greasy foods; I don't believe the news
Or radio, stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story, black America again

[Sample: James Brown]
You know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is lettin' a person feel that they're important. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from…

[Verse 2: Common]
Hot damn, black America again
Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind
The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin
The darker it gets, the less fairer it has been
The hate the hate made, I inherited from them
But I ain't gon' point the finger
We got annointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie
Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me
Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac?
Drinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at?
Endangered in our own habitat
The guns and dope, man, y'all can have it back
As a matter of fact, we them lab rats
You build the projects for, now you want your hood back
I guess if you could rap, you would express it too
That PTSD, we need professionals
You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison, y'all, they tryna pipe us
Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us
You know, you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in your wars and our wars
You put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two
And then, maybe then we'll believe you
See black people in the future
We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya
We hold these truths to be self-evident
All men and women are created equal
Including black Americans

[Sample: James Brown]
You know, you know, you know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is to let a person feel like somebody. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from…

[Intro]
Blak Majik (x 32)

[Verse 1: Common]
Ooh that boy he radical
Talk that money talk emphatical
Who in the game had the baddest hoes
Niggas seen Badu's ass and said "I seen what you was on"
Home grown with no home phone
From the city of wind nigga, win or go home
It's the Chi bullshit I'm on
Make a dome from a brick and a pocket full of stones
Hit them cones, clips and crones
I don't play away games, I got hitters at home
I'm a dime like six in the morn'
Me and Muhammad speak in similar tones
Go hard like pyramid stones
Stand the test of time cross the burning sands
With aggressive rhymes, I'm blessed to rhyme
I invest in time
Like Superman, stick out my chest and shine, I'm

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
Blak Majik (x16)

[Verse 2: Common]
Yeah yeah, I'm black, I'm magical
I ride fun facts that's actual
Keep it one hunnid that's natural
To get them new blue hunnid niggas strapped with flow
Shout out to black and DC make it capital
I done made enough. I don't have to rap no more
Tell the truth, that ain't what I'm rapping fo'
Got a whole lot so we can have some mo'
So rosey go to red diamond make 'em clap some more
Clap clap, home of the original gang bangers, gun clappers, no lackers, rack stackers
Movie, we are black actors
Makin' somethin' out of nothin' blak majik
What I do, I own like magic
Status of the livest and established
Girl with the fattest, I'm givin' you the gladdest
Night you ever had this
Magic

[Break: Jhene Aiko]
Neewteb ni tsixe I ereh ton ma I
Maerd ruoy ni evah uoy suoicsnoc eht ma I

[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
I am the matter that cannot be seen
I am the conscious you have in your dream
Do not be scared of my dark energy
I am not here I exist in between
Yeah that's me I'm magical
I'm black I'm strapped with magic bro
I'm nothing you have had before
I'm everything but nothing more

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]



[Intro: (Common) and Sample]
Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us (x4)
(Listen) Why you had to hide away for (x4)

[Verse 1: Common]
Aston Martin king, Luther with dreams
The young Denzel the way I move through scenes
I’m like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eyeline
Son of the most so from up high I shine
Suited in Prada, stay mellow like lala
Young, fresh, with dollars, ladies go gaga
I’m the cum-lada, top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask, pure religion and cash
From the windows that open, I’m raising my glass
Daylight beams, night life schemes
This is my inception, I’m writing my dreams
Immortal view of a star doing what I’m born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

[Hook: Makeba]
Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

[Verse 2: Common]
It all started with a dream, I wanted to be Run–D.M.C
The Lord put the blessing upon the MC
O to the M, dreams were spoken to him
That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes, yes sir this is what I'm made for
To go hard in the paint like D. Wade or
D. Rose, from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world primos
Red carpet magic, taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care, my music is the medicine
My name holds weight, I am never hesitant
Different state resident, this is hood elegance
SLS classic, pursuing my passion
NOVA Fashion, now I'm Oscar party crashing
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 3: Common]
Silhouettes of dreams that we had high, huh
Even now it don't seem so bad, ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
I'm gone now, imagine what I'm gonna be
Dirty to worthy, now I'm all wordy
My broad up in Paris, looking all purty
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

[Hook]

[Outro: Makeba]
I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
I could see it from my window
Wouldn't take that long to get me there
Keep running til' I can go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how I'm the one
Could've been anywhere, but I'm sitting in the air
With the wheels up staring at the sun
Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, until high we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right



[Hook]
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
(She said "Don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
(She said "Don't break my heart")
Surely you'll break my heart but I'll be there beside you
With lots of love to give
(Love to give...you, you)
Love to give
Love to give

[Verse One]
It was a dream day, met her on spring break
Look like the type that be like "No hable inglés"
She said you look like you rap, where's your bling'e?
And yours clothes is tight but you don't seem gay
I said naw, thats dude from NSYNC'e
She wasn't married, kept her ring on her pinky
She said "You know I dont be datin' rappers"
I said I got my SAG card, baby I'm an actor

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Seen her again at All Star weekend, she ain't have tickets
And she ain't into hoopers, she was there to kick it
With her roommate who was a video vixen
Spend so much on outfits she's about to get evicted
Said "I'm married to this rap shit, looking for a mistress"
You can be by my side like Flavor and Delicious
Long as you ain't scared of the kitchen and the dishes
She said "you one of them fishes, I know your mind switches", and

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Time revolve, we fell in love as crazy as Nas
And them broads was textin cuz I stop calling them
I met the parents, watch the game with her father and
Questions of marriage and I start dodging them
What happen to me happens to lots of men
Get deep in love and then your needing some oxygen
As far as wives I was thinking like Solomon
She said "there you go, breakin my heart again!"

[Hook]

[Interlude]

[Hook]



[Hook]
Everybody home, ain't nobody gone
And I got all my niggas around
It feel good, don't it? Getting hood on it
And I got all my niggas around
I got a couple minutes in town
A couple hundred bitches around
So baby go on and get us a round
Cause I got all my niggas around
Celebrate

[Verse 1]
We partying, yeah got body and
Exotic broads lobbying, Spanish, Somalian
Fly, we live it 'til we die
We living in the night looking in the eye
On our paper 'til we get it like Dubai
Chi niggas stand up, plastic cups
Girls with the drastic butts, that ask for bucks
It don't stop here
Bottles of Veuve pop here
And we gonna get around like 2Pac's here
Celebrate like it's new year
Some bomb broads coming, type nuclear
Yeah, it's so ridiculo
Lit the medicinal, passed it give-and-go
Backwards liquor store
Celebrate

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
In my Paul Smith like an alcoholic
My guys I used to hoop with, is now who I ball with
This raw bitch came in looking flawless
Tonight she'll be giving conscious, headlights!
Beaming from the Beemer that her momma bought her
I got to act right for her like I'm an author
Look where drama brought us, look where karma brought us
Married to the game, like Usher we was caught up
Now we got some R&B broads we can call up
You niggas come around keep the wall up
Smoke blowing out thinking of tomorrow and the simple things
Hustlers from the go, how far we done came
Celebrate

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ah, another night, we love the night
For the life, getting bugged tonight
Wait 'til I get my money right
Told you it's gonna be on like the business that we lean on
Put my team on, get our heat on
Ah, I knew her when she strip, her name was Chardonnay
My niggas move work even on a holiday
We come from porches and alleyways
I'm the big ticket, don't need no one to validate
You celebrate

[Bridge]
We ain't gotta wait
It's a toast to you and me
Bills ain't so bad, celebrate that
Party in the yard 'til the lights come on
Ain't nobody crying
We've come so far, been climbing
Now the clouds they passed us by
C'mon and raise your glass up high

[Hook]



[Hook: Scratches of Kanye West and Common] (x4)
(Common) And ya say Chi-City
(Kanye West) We don't stop, naw, we don't quit

[Verse 1 - Common]
I rap with the passion of Christ, nigga cross me
Took it out of space and niggas thought they lost me
I'm back like a chiroprac' with b-boy survival rap
It ain't ninety-fo' Joe, we can't go back
The game need a makeover
My man retired, I'mma takeover
Tell these halftime niggas break's over
I'm raw, hustlas get your baking soda
Too many rape the culture
Leave rappers with careers and they faith over
It's a war goin' on, you can't fake bein' a soldier
In the basement, listening to tapes of Ultra-
Magnetic, to the fact the messiah is black
I'll turn the TV down, we can take it higher than that
I wonder if these whack niggas realize they whack
And they the reason that my people say they tired of rap
Inspired by black Muslims and Christians
Pushin' cutlasses, dope, and other traditions
In the conditions of the city, the city
The city, the city, the city, the city
Come on

[Hook] (4x)

[Verse 2 - Common]
A black figure...in the middle with chaos and gunfire
So many raps about rims, surprised niggas ain't become tires
On the street you turn cold and then go screech
I tell 'em "fuck 'em" like I do to police
The beast is runnin' rampant
I'm in between sheets tryin' to have sex that's tantric
For the ghetto, tryin' to make a get-up stand-up anthem
You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich?
I slap a nigga like you, and tell him "Rick James bitch!"
With your Hollywood stories, on porches
We polly hood stories about who became rich
And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch
You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch
I'm forever puttin' words together
Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com', has never been involved wit' run
Unless it's DMC, or runnin' these broads to bein' free
I'm harder than the times, you hardly scary
Holdin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry
They ask me where hip-hop is goin', it's Chicagoan
Poetry's in motion like a picture now showin'
It's the city, the city y'all, the city
Uh, the city y'all, come on

[Hook] (7x) [While Kanye West sings]

And ya say Chi-City
(scratched together) Common Sense, from the city of wind



[Verse 1]
The city it blow deep
I know them cold streets
Motif is no peace
Can't trust the police
My mama stay out East
Hope that she good though
She from Inglewood so she know the hood though
Corners we stood on
That's what I stand for
Justice for hustlers I rap and I chant for
Cousin just got off that thang on his ankle
He seeing that corner from a new angle
Same old to same old
Some days are painful
They say be careful
Grandma be stay prayerful
My bros move words with their eyes on sparrow
You in the ghetto where we never settle

[Verse 2]
The breath of the city
No rest for the weary
No stress it can't hear me
A fist full of fury
No dollars no jewellery
A Chicago story
Place that can kill me is one that can cure me
Hard to ignore me 'cuz we livin' loud now
Fire inside me and things that go "Bow Bow"
Label me wild child, my old man on trial now
Yeah I'm the future but live for the now now
Make my mama proud now
We come from that dirt
I put in that work
Until my back hurt
Uh



[Verse 1]
We were from different cities on the same block
Grew up in different circles in the same spot
Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all
Showing her ring off like a player at the ball
I recall the walls that I had up
Attracted to women for things that didn't matter
Ka-clow boom pop! Sound of my heart when it drop
The night that I met her, it might be forever
I hear people saying that they like us together
I ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better
With you, I admit I had issues
Like ebony, your essence, your pedigree, your presence
It's more than clothes can say for you
When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you
I pray for you and us, that we imbue through lust
And accrue the trust, let's shake off the dust
From the cloth

[Hook]
Oh you're worried about when people stop and stare
That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear
Cut from the same, cloth you just want to wear
But that's just a tear because girl I can get you fresh
La la la la, la la la la

[Verse 2]
This is tailor-made love, fit like a snug
Anything we can bear so let's have some cubs
You were there when my cuz passed away
Not only does love, but life hatches day
I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you
Strong seeds I can see with you, the good word I read with you
Looking at things that we've been through
Things that seem simple
I know when to go hard and when to be gentle
Sentimental laughs and expressions
Let's stay in the present, no time for second guessing
You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it, that's so unexpected
Yeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead
Your hunger for affection will always be fed
Thank God we never sped and let love take its course
Cause what's inside of us, no need to outsource
The cloth

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey lover we can cover each other
Through the coldest nights, tight never smother
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's the cloth

[Hook]



[Intro]
It's just a fly love song, what
It's just a fly love song, what

[Verse 1]
Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know your sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile, happiness you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'ma do the best I can do
Cause I'm my best when I'm with you

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you

[Verse 2]
Put down your bags love
I know in the past love
Has been sort of hard on you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit
We dealing wit this water love
You even give my daughter love
I want to build a tribe wit you
Protect and provide for you
Truth is I can't hide from you
The pimp in me
May have to die with you

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind
You're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight

[Verse 3]
You help me to discovery me
I just want you to put trust in me
I kind of laugh when you cuss at me
The aftermath is you touching me
It's destiny that we connected girl
You and I, we can affect the world
I'm tired of the fast lane
I want you to have my last name

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you
(We're gon' make it
I love you, I love you, I love you)

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind
You're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight

[Intro: Big Sean]
Ohh
Walk up in the thing, got my campaign poppin’
Champagne poppin’, bad thang poppin’
Headed to the door, and ain’t a damn thing knockin’
Nooo
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin’
Campaign poppin’, champagne poppin’

[Verse 1: Common]
I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat, we gon’ do it gourmet
I’m hearing fuckin’ voices, like when porn play
Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say? Diamonds are for the day
That means to shine, you find a way
Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made  his transition
Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego
Born to fly, call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This bra from the DR said I was frío
That’s Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo
Pinot noir style, better with time
I’m gambling with watches getting better with time
So I’mma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say “time is money”, forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display

[Hook: Big Sean]
Ohh
Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin’
Champagne poppin’, bad thang poppin’
Headed to the door, and ain’t a damn thing knockin’
Nooo
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin’
Campaign poppin’, champagne poppin’
Hit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppin'
Nooo

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Tryna get it every way, every day, day, day
Tryna get it every way, every day, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Tryna get it every way, every day, day, day
Tryna get it every way, every day, ay ay
Tryna get it every way, every day, day, day

[Verse 2: Common]
Bars in alignment, stars in alignment
Raw off consignment, God’s in the diamonds
Evolve from the science, power and refinement
Read between the lines, hard to define us
Niggas that’s behind us, throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
I’ve seen Len Bias, that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time, man, precious like diamonds
Look through the glass, see what I magnify man
I'mma be shining 'til I die man
I’m a rare diamond that’s hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an A.K
47 to 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity, ain’t no disparity
Between peace and prosperity, so marry me
Diamonds

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
I’m rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin’ that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say “I need that fadeaway”
Had a crush on what’s her name, the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808
Said you can’t take his chain away
Real player you can’t take this game away
Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you can’t take my dame away
Devil in a red dress, but she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day-to-day-to-day-to-day
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me off in court, beating all kinds of cases
Weed, money, pussy, liquor, that’s my favorite compilation
Diamonds
Diamonds



[Hook: Lily Allen]
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
Love is not a mystery, it's everything

[Common]
She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show
Be on the treadmill, uh, like OK Go
Had a body, A body that you can't pay fo'
That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spin class at the gym, strip tease on a pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes, tryin hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp but extra hard for these (hoes)
Readin Us and People mag, tryna get the scoop
Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe
She been through the ball player from the Clippers, then came the pumps off
All thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
Doin all she can for a man and a baby
Drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady

[Hook]

[Common]
He had paper since we was in we was in high school
Pop was a doc, mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks, in his ears he kept jewels
One of the Diddy types, da D-D-Dame Dash dudes
Pushed a Maserati sport, reading the Robb Report
Wanted to be Mike but he was never live at sports
Since golf is in he was on the drivin course
To live the rap life is what he was strivin for
Spendin cash at the bar to get credit
Drinkin Chaundon just because Big said it
They say Ye is but dude was big headed
Rocked the fur in the summer so somebody'd pet it
He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid
It's a shame what they do for fame and to be respected
Joe, you coulda got it if you never woulda stressed it

[Hook]

[Common]
They was one of them couples, people said they were the it
Unbreakable, like Bobby and Whit
Or Ryan and Reese, or Kimora and Russ
Relationships can be dead but look live to us
I guess we all been through it where we try too much
Losin yourself and you're lyin and stuff
Wishin for the diamond cuffs, in search of a ring
Where love is not a mystery it's everything

[Hook]

[Outro: Lily Allen]
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me
Love is not a mystery, it's everything



[Hook]
Electric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!

[Verse 1]
Blood and magic dripping from me
True thugs and addicts I grip an entry
Enter this game with tricks and envy
I forget game to remain an MC
Rooms in this mind that's still empty
Only fufilled through prophecy
You stoppin me, you see I'm tryna catch this plane
You must be slow nigga, catch your brain
It's fresh, but it is some stress in fame
Got hoes? Ho nigga respect the game
I talked to cab drivers about the fast lane
And Islam, masters and chakras and beyond
Think about the hustle and somehow I see by
Wrote a letter to the concrete, P.S. we strong
You was at your hardest when you didn't even try
Live like a bitch, to bitch you gonna die

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Mercury in retrograde
I'm tryna get niggas in the ghetto paid
While they watch pornos and Escalades
Away from floats and the dope in sex parades
Somebody screamin in my mind, I'm tryna find if it's me
Or voices from the master, they desgin to be free
Same revolt, can't be found on TV
Or radio, it's livin in me
Hey lady, that smoke is bothering me
If I put it in your eye, ashes you would cry
All this rap talk is blowing my high
I just came to chill and build with my guy
I try to walk but I stumble off the humble path
This story of a pimp stick that became a staff
You got it, you gotta know where to aim the Mag
Art and opinions are made to clash

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Out of body experience, hard to explain
Like the pyramids and gods I remain
I know pain, like Kurt Cobain
Or A.I. playin, hurt the whole game
Dig it to the Earth's brain for worst gain
Focused like young blood on his first chain
I used to write shit to please niggas
Now I write shit to freeze niggas
Whether iced out, or American Pie sliced out
I sit in the room with the lights out
Whether diced out, or with their hair spiked out
I sit alone in the room with the lights out screamin

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her, I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful

[Hook]
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
I'd like to be her very best friend

[Verse 2]
He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, "Why do men always have to stray?"
He said, "I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet"
"I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'"
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, "I'm tryin' to get my life together"
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions
"Baby you a blessin' and my best friend"

[Hook]

[Bridge]
(Bilal with his voice overlapping) Faithful to the end
(Bilal) Faithful to the end
(John Legend singing)
(John Legend & Bilal) I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful
(John Legend & Bilal) I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful

[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse 1: Common]
Victory won, in a world of Henessey and guns
Too young for the marches but I remember these drums
The stark reality of wars and battles
We fought for ours, caught in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognize the importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises, street life is pumpin' fast, lives is
I watched Crash and realize that we all survivors
No religion or race could ever describe us
My guys do dirt, move dirt, but never really talk about it
Forever begins just because I thought about it

[Hook: Bilal] x4
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone

[Verse 2: Common]
Ashes and snowfalls
I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come
Forever gon' come
It's a cold world and I can never go numb
Look fear in the eyes, say I never gon' run
Sooner then later, I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree by jury, together we hung
Now we let our chains hang and gang bang to maintain
'Ghanistan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down, at each other we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the ride I learned to earn hard
Watch gangstas turn God in the midst of war
No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor
It was in the wind when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we'd live forever through song

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Pops]
Origin is forever
Well, well well
Here we are back in the studio again
Look at that
Hey I don' need no cue cards
They got the engineers holdin up the cue cards
What that say?
Oh they say, just talk, don't sing
Son, I bet you feel like you and I've been here forever
30 years old red eyes, beholding red eyes
I see my world's tears
Yeah, origin is forever
Every peak will have 2 valleys
Hopeful eyes in the comfort
Of true protection and admiration of a child
That's forever
Forever is to strive
A place of endearment
Forever is what I leave
My I-self contribution
Damn, what I'm gon' leave?
Ok...
I'll leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand
To universal scales of humanity, all humanity
Forever is finding a solution to a solution
Tsunamis, hurricanes
Following the trails of the African slave ships
War, war, and more war
Floods, Columbine, global warming, earthquakes
Another somebody done me wrong, son
Virginia Tech, is not an, "Oh, what the heck?"
We're still, did you place your one grain
Of spiritual sand forever?
Confusion need a solution
Blend and stir, stir and blend
The pot of humanity; sift the ingredients
Of acknowledgment, apology, amendment, atonement
We gonna work with the four A's here
Forever Pops
Common good is forever...
God's memory is forever...

Ghetto niggas' dreams
From the hood

[Verse 1: Common]
I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake
Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait
To get home, early in the morn' getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low, money by her Bible
The type of bitch that big said he would die for
Is the type that I ride and stay alive for
Tats on her back, looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together, she weathered the storm
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform
Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on

[Verse 2: Common]
I don't even say shit, she can feel it
Eye talk's the realest, toenails acrylic
Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it
Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet
Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the back of Stony
Ghetto Prince, she's my Apollonia
Like chick that had the back of Tony, Montana
Reminded me a me of my, of my mama
Knowing the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes
My tweets is the streets that I know who my friends is
Endless love for the money, power and clothes
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
She might get to snapping if the cabinets ain't closed
When the cameras start snapping, she's ready to pose

[Verse 3: Nas]
I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention
For me, getting women turned from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes, congresswomen inflictin'
Pain onto my game, wanted and I'm sadistic
They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted
'til I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit
Crib raising kids, Labrador behind the white fence
But I'm still single, looking for Cleopatra
African Queen, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor
Y'all niggas in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours
She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette, my manors
Half hood half class, photographers' cameras
Caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this
She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit
Events having sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms
You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects

[Hook: Kanye West (& John Mayer)]
(Go) go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three
(Go) go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three
(Go) go, go, go, go, go, go
And on the count of three everybody run back to your fantasy, now

[Verse 1: Common]
(Go) She was a bad uh
The type at the club niggas would grab her
(Go) Fantasized when I had her
In the bathroom sweatin' with her ass up
(Go) The body of a dancer
We had chemistry cause she was a Cancer
Thought forever it would last for
But forever move faster, so I had to
(Go) Still I gotta pause
When I think about her in them draws
(Go) And uh, ooh baby she liked it raw and
Like rain when she came it poured
(Go) And like a car that I can't afford
I would want it then want some more
The positions our frames explored let me know
She was secure, back for more I wanna

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
(Go) Freaky like the daughter of a pastor
Said I was bait for her to master
(Go) Little red corvette now she was faster
Wet dreams la Mer cream the bathroom
(Go) We make love and then laughter
And anyway I wanted I could have her
Said there were some girls that did attract her
A new chapter she was after so I said let's
(Go) To a place that you wanna be, uh
Get what you want from her and me, uh
(Go) Free love I wanna see, uh
Hot sex in the third degree, uh
(Go) You gettin' served while servin' me, uh
Dirty words encourage me to
Rock steady and sturdily on
You turnin' me no turnin' back the further we

[Hook]



[Hook]
So we made it to this same end of the road
And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold
How I made it out with my soul

[Verse 1]
Ashtrays and cigarretes, last days, indigenous people
These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
The smell of success, I want y'all to get a whiff of this
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
I write it, and still get invited to white Christmases
When I was born, three wise men came to visit us
One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts
You from Chicago, we want you to deliver this
Show the walking dead who the true and living is
Separate the fake from who the real reals is
Hot tub time machine, back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings
I guess it's my addiction to women
I was in France, in to see Hennessy blending
Writing my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams
Now it's new beginnings like a born again Christian
On the mic, victorious, story is redemption

[Bridge]
I'm sitting at the top, I'm not alone
I'm standing here with my soul

[Verse 2]
Feed our souls with two fish and five loaves
Teach a man to cook it for survival
My dad said it rained on my arrival
Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow
Like I was 5-0, but my creed's Apollo
On the rock and roll with the coldest live show
For those before I came, I made the song cry for 'em
Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low
This is the Kilimanjaro, like Twitter you can follow
It may be hard to read like hieroglyphics
Written on the walls of Cairo, check my youth revival
Truth inside flow, I stand like Em did with Dido
Crash parties, any live yo
Is libel to get banged like things that rival tribal slang
From the pride we'll reign, kill the game and watch it die slow
Ali MC, I fight for more than the title
Your idol

[Common]
Phone rang
Screen said caller ID blocked
But for some reason, I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years
Spending these last two days with his momma and his kids
When he spoke, I wasn't trying to hear it
Cause I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he had done
He said now it's time for him to turn himself in
For no longer could he run
From life, from God
I started thinkin, "Why is doin' right is so hard?"
I thought back to when we was in London, discussin' the New Testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became desperate, so I asked him: "Why you gotta go?"
He said, "You know, turn to Matthew 24"
He said, "No one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near; don't let anything lead you astray
As long as God is with me, everything will be okay"
So right about then, we decided to pray...

[Omar Lye-Fook]
Just lying back making the smoke disperse away....
Deep into clouds (deep into clouds)
It's making things appear to me so clearly....
Deep in the clouds (deep in the clouds)
Just lying back making the smoke disperse away...
Deep in the clouds (deep in the clouds)
It's making things appear to me so clearly...
Deep into clouds (yeah)

[Cee-Lo Green]
Your time
Is a terrible thing to waste!!!
For there's
Not one of these possesions that you can bring to space (yeah, it don't matter)
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase (yes it is)
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face (yeah)
He gon see it!

[Bilal]
(keeps on )
This feeling just keeps on lifting me higher (ever)
And its everflowing it's everflowing
(keeps on )
When every thing, puts a smile on my face(ever-flowing, ever-flowing)
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going (he keeps on going)
I keep on going on!!
(he keeps on going echo)

[Jill Scott]
All mighty love
Watching over me....
A smile........brillant.....
All over .....constantly.....
Warm .....comforting.....
Perfect...like ...no..thing
No hate..no confusion...no strain
Simply peace.... simply
Simply...simply...simply

[Mary J. Blige]
No fear! Heaven is to me
No fear of destruction
Understanding who he is
His name is Christ!!(yeah)
Heaven, heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge

[Erykah Badu]
Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white
Angels sing and cymbols glare
No ones rich no one's poor
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love
Wonderful dream wake me when you're home

[Pops]
Heaven? Heaven is being Pops
Heaven is spending a day with the grand children
Listening to their voices and laughter and play
And then at the end of the day we hug, we kiss, and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me around the knees
Yeah, thats heaven to me



[Intro: Minister Louis Farrakhan]
A man whose genius and freedoms and—
Ability to communicate and—
To talk, and to touch chords—
A man who has the ability and the audacity
And the unmitigated gall God to stand up, to stand up

[Verse 1: Common]
I heard the sound of the trumpets, the voice on the throne
Seen the twenty-four elders and I knew I was home
I was told to write a song for the people
Take the original Hebrews on an Exodus of Black Excellence
Tell them to invest in us and make testaments about each other
On how we sisters and brothers
Cover the land and corners with poems and stone
Go hard with it, let 'em know you God with it
Even though I authored it, let no one margin it
And make it all about paper or first week's sales
Though this is from Heaven give 'em verses from Hell
Those that fell off the path, bring 'em back to the math
Your staff will be your microphone
Your name is Common, you was born to fight the norm
Take house niggas outta darkness 'til they lights is on
I'ma put a hyphen on your name: rapper-actor-activist
You the one that can reach into the black abyss
Stars that's asterisks, show 'em what a classic is
Freedom riders need passengers
In your lyrics use scriptures and passages
To make them rise like Lazarus and resurrect it again
They'll put disrespect on your name and respect it again
Every section you in, bless 'em and keep bussin'
If they don't like it, shake the dust and say "fuck em"
Until you get home, I'm the one you trust in

[Interlude]
I'm happy to be in any place
Where God's name is remembered

[Hook: Bilal]
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Trouble of this world, trouble of this world
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Going home to live, going home to live
Going home to live with God

[Verse 2: Common]
Go into the wilderness like Musa on a pilgrimage
Streets are villages, speak with diligence and authority
The fake are the Pharisees and Sadducees
Give them that Garvey free from the Black Odyssey
Yo pardon me, you the God bodily
Functioning on earth as a part of me, that's why I gave you artistry
Go into the hoods with the shooters and the strippers
Forget the New World Order, New Jerusalem is with us
Tell sisters they earths and goddesses
If they got bottom, don't get caught in a bottomless
Pit, there's a lot of us fit for the kingdom is near
You can tell by the wars and how the seasons appear
You'll appear in the circles in Hollywood, I birth you
In Chicago, you know how to parlay good
You'll get Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys, give those to your family
Don't get caught up in the vanity or the world's insanity

[Hook: Bilal]
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Trouble of this world, trouble of this world
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Going home to live, going home to live
Going home to live with God

[Outro]
To those of you who are unfamiliar with those words
They mean, in English, 'Peace, be unto you'



[Intro: Snoh Aalegra]
Black and blue outside her soul
Carries a heart of gold
Her misconception 'bout what love is, she passes on
The child she brings in to the world don't know
Right from wrong
Her soul is sore, she deserves more

[Verse 1: Common]
Red lipstick bo', French press col'
You know she queen bee by the way she wear her gold
Honey gettin' money the ass is stupid
She far from a dummy funny I thought she came from money how she makin' money
At the club going hard like liquor
Shots of ciroc she can out drink a nigga
Niggas dig her think they can take her to the crib and break her mover her shake her you can't fake her
She knows time is paper
Glaciers on her neck-uh
Pleasures on her finger
Gucci purse carry notes like a singer uh uh
Go to the steam room and she carry a steamer
Beamer benz she got friends
She got friends in high ends
She know trend she know when
She go in like an investor
Yes sir, never getting gassed like a Tesla
Ain't about all that extra
Destiny brought her to where niggas bought her, a lot of shit
She ain't caught up bitches taught her to hustle
Hustle harder than a nigga

[Hook: Common (Dreezy)]
(Uh huh)
She hustle harder than a nigga (True)
She hustle harder than a nigga (Uh huh)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get) x4

[Verse 2: Common]
She bad, uh uh, she bad
Don't complain about it but she let you know when she on that rag
Swag like Angelina or more like Angela Bassett
Many aspects emphasis sophisticated and ratchet
She fasted for a week that's stronger than most
If she had kids she could mother father them both
Prominent host throw a party and she know everybody
Devil in a tight dress something that is golly
She know what niggas want she know how to make 'em hunt
Hotel suite at the Trump
The way she walk in them pumps
Talkin' 'bout takin' over the world while holding a blunt
She hold her man down when her man get locked up
Prada keep movin' she movin' and shake it like Parkinson's
Used to seel hot purses and network marketing
Eye shadow darker than them dudes she like
An actress her life is so movie like
She hustle harder than a nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dreezy]
Uh, Dreezy
Look
I be livin' like I need a Lamborghini
I make it happen I would never need a genie
Went and got zucchini
Threw away that fettuccine
I been going to the gym I'm tryna get in that bikini
I'mma, smart chick but I never went to Harvard
I'm like a Nina got designer for my armor
Lookin' for a presidential nigga like Barbara
I'm harder, at these niggas heads like a Barber
This is for my ladies whose single but got a baby
Who Probably driving a Honda but saving for that Mercedes
This is for my pretty women that know that they independent
You say that her shit is rented she probably get offended, man
The new kid like a transfer
I'm known to set trends let them copy like the answers
I could be a lady in the streets but in the booth I pull triggers
Shots fired I got harder than a, nigga

[Outro]
Afternoon, breezy afternoon too, the winds out west at fourteenth gusting at 22 O'Hare
High today 62, maybe some rain tonight, a low of 40 degrees
60 at O'Hare midway 61, the lake front at 60 and Wheeling sunny at 60



[Hook: Jill Scott]
Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I, I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah

[Verse 1: Common]
People say I got soul, look at all the records I hold
The lives I've affected, connect and control
With me in your basement your mama got blown
I provide the vibe to keep the strippers on poles
Through me the black experience is glorious told
From a school that's old, bold, so I rock gold
And platinum, some cats I hold notes and cash for them
On streets I rap with them, in ghettos I blast for them
Mash with them, at the party and all
Be the universal language that's embodying all
Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all
Y'all feel most high when I be in y'all
System, with the rhythm I up jump the boogie
Shame I rely on record labels to push me
Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape
Through eight-tracks, wax, CD's and tapes
I am music

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You can feel me all over alive, I help culture survive, I opened the eyes of many
Styles y'all wrote in the skies, with your lows and highs
Open your mind to hear me
In the streets I beat cops and obsolete
On every station it's hot, you can't stop my heat
I taught Jay and Dre how to rock the beat
On what's going on today, yo, I gots to speak
I take the stand, yo, you could feel me bam
Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan
Live I be killing it man
For how long I survived yo I'm realer than man
Got a soft side but I'm still a man
For me women cry and children dance, I'm trying to eat
I could'a got a mil and ran
But like Sly for the fam still I stand
I am music

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I been here since the beginning
Beginning of time, yo, beginning of time
Deep in the mind of the ancient ones
Everybody love me like they do the sun
I shine at times, yo, at times I'm dark
You can't categorize me, my mind's a art
Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts
I'm the one you roll with when you're riding smart
The change that came, the change that comes
I change with chords and I kick it with drums
Get blown with horns and did it on the one
Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung
Spun around the world at parties and weddings
Wherever I go, I create the setting
You know me from lessons or your pop's collection
Whether whole or half stepping, I'm a blessing
Yo, I am music

[Hook]



[Verse 1: Common]
Y'all cats know the abstract nigga with a attitude
Pass the booze and let's build on it
I'm rolling in a Cadillac with the grill fronted
I ain't even smoke no bo but I feel blunted
Yo I'm toking on the freedom, stepping to the A.M
Cats is toting in the BM, tell them players I'm the G.M
Told my team let me get my plays straight and I'mma feed them
They need me like I need them, see the streets is bleeding
Had a meeting with my mind on how I can be divine and
Stay on my grind, I'm grinding until I get blue balls
Every day same shit new stall
Don't make me act like where I come from cause it's brutal
It's a place that you run from if you neutral
Hustlers in Volks, customers and smoke
I kiss the sky feeling high off the stuff that I wrote

[Hook: Pharrell]
I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
(I got the right to feel high) I got the right to feel high
(I got the right to feel high) I got the right to feel high
I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
(I got the right to feel high) I got the right to feel high
(I got the right to feel high) I got the right to feel high

[Verse 2: Common]
I'm the only cat in hip hop that can go to a thrift shop
Bring that get up to the ghetto and get props
If you gon' get that kick-a-box make sure that bitch knock
If you gon' get that Glock don't be scared to lick shot
Hip Hop is changing, y'all want me to stay the same?
Sort of like Barkley on how I see the game
I recognize game like a scout
Ayo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out
I ain't about that, messing with no other man's woman
Because of jealousy then a man go under
Understand a man and his mental
Listening to Joan Mitchell with the fan in the window
Can it be so simple then?
I rock Rockports, you rock Timberlands
I want a Rover but I'm thinking long range
I ain't switch over I just made my own lane

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Common]
Like a pimp to a ho I connect to the track
I feel it in my neck and my back
A thug came to me, said it changed his life
Said the love of his life, he used to bang to The Light
I'm trying to do better, I ain't claiming Mister Right
I'm a grown man, too old to fist-fight
Stay on point like trick dice
You tweaking like a sound man you need to switch mics
Sounding bitch like
I know the block is hot but we just can't get ice
Want our children's children to sit nice
I sing the song to make the fiend's strong
King Kong ain't got shit on me
I train days to rip emcees
I'm vegan but I still gotta get that cheese
You on some monkey bar damn chimpanzees
Mobbing through Chi-Town so feel the breeze yo

[Hook]



[Chorus: will.i.am]
Once the love was strong
Now it’s long, long gone
Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holding on
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

[Verse 1: Common]
I’ve been thinking bout, I’ve been thinking bout
I’ve been thinking bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love, feel I need another dose
I know it’s a feeling that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl, it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice, where did the king go wrong?
Emotions that, that they linger on
I guess cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls, I need your warm
The taste of your mouth, girl, I need your warm
Good food and love I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer so I’m a keep dreaming on
It’s kind of like ‘The Breakup’ with Jen and Vince Vaughn

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Once the love was strong
Now it’s long, long gone
Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holding on
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

[Verse 2: Common]
They say you don’t know, know, know what you got
’Til what you got is gone
Yeah I like such and such, yo a lot but the feeling’s not as strong
We were like 2 birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasn’t able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you, my God
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess it’s only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Once the love was strong
Now it’s long, long gone
Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holding on
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

[Bridge: Common]
We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it, I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say, girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun we can sing this together

[Outro: will.i.am]
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you



(Instrumental)



[Verse 1]
Night blows, stoves don't work, hoes at work
A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
Trippin' on heights, wishin' for Nikes in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy, short-body Caddies
Uncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggas named Butch, Scoot or Bae-Bae
With weight so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto
This is Chicago in the heyday
Similar to Good Times, I guess that I was JJ
A skinny nigga, young girls with Penny figures
So many niggas, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they on
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo, I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good workin' with my hands
My generation never understood workin' for the man
And, of being broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world

[Hook]
It's your world

[Verse 2]
Life and death flow around us
Four pounds and pounds of bird from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high, that's why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from Earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl sellin' her body, wish she knew what it was worth
Between God and trash, lookin' in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growin' up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her stepfather thought he was Ike, so her mother he strike
She got to like like-minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures
Doin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks that lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our Jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi, we even rootin' for a garbage team
This queen never seen herself on this Corner
She still wanna see California
But this is her world

[Hook]

Kids
I wanna be a pediatrician
I wanna be a governor
I want to be a artist

I wanna be a superstar

[POPS]
Be, be here, be there, be that, be this
Be grateful for life, be grateful to life
Be gleeful everyday, for being the best swimmer among 500,000
Be-nign, be you, be mom's mean pie
Be little black Sambo with bad hair
Be aware of Willie Lynch-ism
Be, be boundless energy
Be a four star ghetto general, be no one except I
Be a strong academic student, be an A student in Sociology
Be food for thought to the growin mind, be the author of your own horoscope
Be invited, be long-living, be forgiving, be not forgetful
Be a proud run, only to return to fight another day
Be peaceful if possible, but justice at any rate
Be high when you low, be on time but know when to go
Be cautious of the road to college, taking a detour through Vietnam or the Middle East
Be absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves
Be visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while beggin
A nation built on free labor for reparation, Be a cartographer
A map maker, be able to find Afro-American land
Search thoroughly, it may be close to black land
Be amended 5/5ths, be amended 5/5ths human
Be the owner of more land than is set aside for wild life
Be cupid, to world government
Be found among the truth, lost tribe
Be at full strength when walking through the valley
Be not foolish as temporary king of the mountain top
Be a brilliant soul, sparkling in the galaxy while walking on earth
Be loved by God as much as God loved Gandhi and Martin Luther King
Be that last one of 144,000, be the resident of that twelfth house
Be... eternal



[Verse 1: Erykah Badu & Common]
Everyone hides their faces
Behind a mask they wear
Jimi was a rock star
Searching for that magic place
That he could touch in the sky
Just to get his people high

[Verse 2: Erykah Badu & Common]
Life is so colorful
Reds, blues and dreams
Jimi lives in a purple haze
In a psychedelic maze
Playing the streets like an instrument
Pulling strings wherever he went
Angel sent from the sky
Just to get his people high

[Bridge: Erykah Badu & Common]
Women all around
Fast cars and sound
And freedom he was bound
Couldn't see the ground
Jimi, come out why don't you set me free? (set me free)

[Verse 3: Erykah Badu & Common]
So high, born to fly
Getting high off his own supply
With the most highs of the sky
Everybody follows the same lord
Choosing his light to guide the way
You do, but who do you choose?
Some try things but few die so young
Something among Jimi was stung
Everyone hides their faces
Behind a mask they wear

[Outro: Erykah Badu]
(Jimi, come out why don't you set me free?)
[Repeat until fade out]



[Intro]
For his goodness and for his wonderful works
Unto the children of men
If my people will lift my name tonight
I will come in! I will be exalted!
I will be glorified! I will be lifted up!
Welcome him in tonight
Can't you feel him? Yes, yes
There is liberty
Open your heart tonight
Welcome him in, put them hands together
Fellowship, joy and peace

[Verse: Common]
All praise to the all-eye seeing supreme-being
Giver of joy and peace, love supreme freedom
See him in your son, see him in the daughters
The mountains, the waters, all divine order
The king unseen, one dream that I had, I was talking to my dad
He said, "Things ain't as bad as they seem"
Is this a God dream the way 'Ye sing it?
The dream seemed to go on as the day lingered
The meaning of life, you can't frame or name it
True stars remain like the name of David
Niggas get foreign cars and think they made it
It ain't yours 'til you create it
In the image of the beneficent, merciful, universal, versatile
My verses go 'til Heaven and Earth become reversible
Christ particle, so anything is possible
Fuck big brother, father, mother, God is watching you

[Chorus: Bilal]
And I want the joy, joy
And I want to know the peace of mind
I'll make a way, a way to see
Through it all and all, living for joy and peace
Still in awe in the night when it hurts
And your bed feels like snow, there's a joy in the rain
In your heart, there's a way
Turn your light on, turn your light on
Turn your light on, turn your light on
Turn your light on, turn your light on
Turn your light on, turn your light on
Turn your light on, turn your light on



[Produced by No I.D.]

[Spoken]
I do dirt, in search of a clear mind
Money talk, somebody's gonna hear mine
Grind early before 9:30
Got the nine and the thirty
Kiss of death, you heard me?
My world ain't worldly, any time could be my time
I get high, but still ain't seen Chicago skyline
In my prime, stakes is high cause it's beef
Out here in these streets
Everybody tryna eat off the same plate
Dead presidents, we want the same face
And to think, me and the president, we from the same place
Four-hundred and twenty-one murders, ain't tryna be of the same fate
If I die and go to heaven, will I make it through the main gate?

[Intro: Common]
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh
Ah yes, my Lord, Ah, Oh
Ah yes, my Lord, Ah, Oh

[Verse 1: Common]
Second row of the church with my hood on
My homie used to rap, he was about to get put on
At his funeral, listening to this church song
His family yelling and screaming, I hurt for ‘em
A cold world that’s why we pack heaters
Listening to this preacher as he tryna reach us
I’mma need to go back, I gots to get 'em
Back and forth in these streets, that’s the rhythm
Revenge is supposed to be the Lord's but I use my own accord
When I seen him on the porch, cost my man his life, I can’t afford not to hit him
Shots ripping through his True Religion denim
These streets was my religion
I stood over him, his life is over then
Now these keys got me locked up with older men
Thought these was the keys for me to roll a Benz
They ended up being the keys for my life to end

[Hook: Common]
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (yeah)

[Verse 2: Common]
My money ain't straight, my fam ain't straight
Ain't wanna push kis, heaven couldn't wait
I was hurtin', couldn't get no work
You created me from dust, that's why I did dirt
You said that the last shall be first
Now I'm in a hearse, what's this cash really worth?
My whole life I had to worry about eatin’
I ain’t have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the kingdom for Chicago gon' come?
I’m coming back like the Prodigal Son, and I got a son
And I don’t want my waves following him, the streets swallowing him
And I don’t want no hollows in him, his momma said she see his father in him
Hope it’s the good things, ‘til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates ‘cause I know you’ve forgiven what I’ve done
I’m your son, do I have the keys to get in?

[Hook: Common]
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (yeah)
Ooh (sing)

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Sweet Lord Jesus, tell the polices to let a nigga breathe
My sinning father see, got a shipment by the seas
See my niggas tryna eat, eat whatever’s on your plate
Save some for me, the worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to heaven ‘cause I couldn’t get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back ‘cause these stripes ain’t free
We still wading in the water, cocaine, blunts, marinating in the water
Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell ‘em talk is cheap, niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust, leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control, just walking my soles low
Lit up with the abuse, they wasn’t for show, I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day, bare faced, giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you? They know me on the streets where I grew
If you ain’t from around here you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for them keys
To the kingdom

[Hook: Common]
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (yeah)

[Verse 1: Common]
Southern leaves, southern trees we hung from
Barren souls, heroic songs unsung
Forgive them Father they know this knot is undone
Tied with the rope that my grandmother died
Pride of the pilgrims affect lives of millions
Since slave days separating, fathers from children
Institution ain't just a building
But a method, of having black and brown bodies fill them
We ain't seen as human beings with feelings
Will the U.S. ever be us? Lord willing!
For now we know, the new Jim Crow
They stop, search and arrest our souls
Police and policies patrol philosophies of control
A cruel hand taking hold
We let go to free them so we can free us
America's moment to come to Jesus

[Chorus: Bilal]
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)

[Verse 2: Common]
The caged birds sings for freedom to ring
Black bodies being lost in the American dream
Blood of black being, a pastoral scene
Slavery's still alive, check Amendment 13
Not whips and chains, eye subliminal
Instead of 'nigga' they use the word 'criminal'
Sweet land of liberty, incarcerated country
Shot me with your ray-gun
And now you want to trump me
Prison is a business, America's the company
Investing in injustice, fear and long suffering
We staring in the face of hate again
The same hate they say will make America great again
No consolation prize for the dehumanized
For America to rise it's a matter of Black Lives
And we gonna free them, so we can free us
America's moment to come to Jesus

[Chorus: Bilal]
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)

Won't be long (Won't be long)



[Verse]
How should I begin?
This is the story of a boy named Lonnie Lynn
As I say it, the spirits enwhip me
He was raised in the belly of the city
Chicago, discovered by du Sable
A Black Frenchman that I had to mention
Extensions of a young man livin' on a low end
47th and Michigan, lackin' a little discipline
Know Grandma Mable did the best she could
You know how young niggas want a testy hood
There he stood, taller than most black boys
One of the best ballers out of Illinois
College in Ohio, this is like his bio
Talks that we had, man, they was never idle
He talked about readin' the Quran and the Bible
He talked how he smoked dope and sold it for survival
He talked about the ancestors, in our lives; they're vital
He said y'all niggas love the bang 'cause you tribal
Spiral of life, Chicago to Denver
Anywhere he went, of attention, he's the center
6'9", big heart, big mind
He he spent a lifetime tryin' to be big time
He did in a way, he made to the ABA
And the things he say on my record
When I was a shawty, he bought me "The Message"
It was his messages in the life I would step with
Didn't see him much, spirits are connected
The Father creates it, the son can reflect it
His perspective: sometimes seemed crazy
His perspective: sometimes seemed brilliant
His perspective: somehow it shaped me
His perspective: undoubted I feel it
He'd walk around in them Air Jordans I gave him
I said, "Pops, them from Mike, man, you better save 'em"
The fight that he had with cancer was a brave one
Took Dr. Sebi's herbs instead of medication
Breathing heavy, he talked reparations
He said, "Son, we live through our generations"
Offspring, coughing, Gene Ammons playing
In the background, he was talking, I was praying
Our Father, take care of my father
As far as he went, may I go farther
May our dreams and legacies live through our children
Though I can't touch him, I can still feel him

[Pops talking]
You know the other day I got a phone call. I got a message says pops you been gon from home too long. So I set my bags down and headed to 87th street. I was just back in the neighborhood ya know cruising the same street that I used to cruise in my long black Fleetwood. Listening to the Minister and Dr. King and my beloved brother Malcolm. First thing is see I'm boundless with spiritual energy. I wanna talk about the moral necessities of human justice. The power and the action of God-given dignity. One can not enter the gate if you hate. You gotta take the lead for the rest of the world, 87th is the street of knowledge. The streets of knowledge are all over the world. We got a possibility again of leading the world. Chi my Chi we gon ask you for safe passage for the kids to walk to school. Alright, my young homies, we got a mission to finish. We got the unborn that we got to provide the truth for

[Tasha Cobbs]
I gotta be honest it's so much different without you here
But I have no fear
I'll see you when I get there
To that city bright and fair
You were all I needed you to be
And now I thank you for all you gave for me
So Father, I stretch my hands to Thee
No other help I know
If you withdraw yourself from me
Somebody tell me where, oh where shall I go?

Father, I stretch my hands to Thee
No other help I know
If you withdraw yourself from me
Tell me where, oh where shall I go?



[Hook]
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids
Live nig's, real niggas express and taste it
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showing love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end
Yo

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hoping it'd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Some say that I'm a dreamer cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in, fall in it
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life, it's the scrimmage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people, love always
Yeah

[Hook]



[Hook: PJ]
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?

[Verse 1: Common]
I'm on what? What you on to?
I'm the sun god, let me warm you
Out of my sides the Lord formed you
Pull your dress up, ain't nothin' formal
Our fragrance is patience
We could major in communication
Relatin' like we cousins, though we kissin' though
Love can be sick or medicinal
A doctor of it, you gots to love it
God body language I be spittin' while we fuckin'
In your ear with somethin' that ain't clear
On your inside it appear, so somehow you hear
I'm sayin' I wanna stay inside
They say I'm a deep nigga, I'ma go way inside
Of everything you are
Cause everything you are is my lovestar

[Hook: PJ]
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?

[Verse 2: Common]
I ain't the type to be all up on your social
I'm in your face vocal the way a man supposed to
A choosy lover, I chose you
God's most beautiful creation, let me mold you
You already in shape, that's more love to make
Feel free when I'm with you, it's hard to escape
When we need a break
We take it
When two souls connect you can't fake it
TV shows and cakes, I know your favorite
Cut from the same cloth, let's wear it
This ain't about labels, this about fit
Since God designed, we can start our own line
Our offspring will be you, me, and He combined
We walk the runway like blaow
Bein' in love is never out of style

[Hook: PJ]
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?

[Verse 3: Marsha Ambrosius]
Heaven agrees you are all that I need down here
Cause you make it all worth it
We do this on purpose
The love we make is certain
I'm so caught in your aura, get lost in your force
I want to be your everything forever, forever

[Hook: PJ]
What we gonna do, baby?
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?

[Outro]
Forever, I wanna be forever
Forever, star
Lovestar, lovestar



[Hook]
I remember (REPEATS)

[Verse 1]
I remember she sit there with her thickness
Never played a game but I heard about them sisters
A wise mister said love is "gonna get'cha"
But that ain't what I read in the scriptures, God be with us
It was hard for me to take down the pictures
I was tripping, I even called her sister
I could be someone you could talk to, each and every day
But you were 'bout to marry, be on your merry way
I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J
Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay
Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now
We fell in love huh just to fall apart now
I get your calls and I try to disregard now
What was easy for us now is hard now
Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hell nah, I'm waiting on your call
Told you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls
Issues that I had
Some say it comes from not seeing my dad
Keep moving on
Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch
Girl, my heart is broke and I need a crutch
Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up
Ass got me layed up, girl I never gave up
On you and us, I tried to take it day by day, and whew its tough
I know your young and you gotta live your life ma
I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya
I must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest
So confusing losing love, I'm saying god bless
Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?

[Hook]



[Intro: Nina Simone]
Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
No one can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong you see some bad
Well I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Common]
Yeah, uh (Misunderstood)
We do this, for the people that walk that path
Tryna get to their dream, yeah, uh (oh)

He stood on the corner with the rest of them
Though he knew that this corner wasn't the best of him
Hard streets and a life that crested him
Dirt police domestic beefs that's festerin
He knew the President wadn't addressin him
Though dead presidents was undressin him
Two kids from hot sex no protection and
People don't see how AIDS is affectin 'em
It get hard to get the get the God question in
Can't find a job so you robbin and hustlin
He killed marks and sold dope for cousin 'em
Can't believe they would be the ones bucking him
He on the ground he could feel God touching him
He heard the sound of his moms sayin trust in him
At heaven's gate, saying Lord please let me in
Or send me back to tell my people to be better men

[Hook: Nina Simone]
Misunderstood
Cause we are - Misunderstood
Misunderstood, Don't let me be misunderstood
I'm just human, oh

[Common]
Uh, yeah
She dancin she dance she dance for them
Her body move but her mind was manic'n
Thinkin I don't know where they hands have been
Relationships with men have been so damagin
She thought back to when she was at Howard and
Dreams of doing scenes with Terrence Howard and
Broadway plays and dancin with Alv and them
The ones that make it always ain't the talented
Some dreams get lost never to be found again
At first strippin seemed so empowerin
Most every girl wanna do it now and then
But bein meat every day is devourin
Cats puttin paper where she put powder and
Life would break her, now she powderin
She was high when she fell down and then
Crowd surrounding and, heart was poundin and
She fell into a deep sleep the siren sounded and
Seen bright lights in the midst of clouds and then
Talked to God, feeling like his child again
Said Lord let me live so I can make you proud again

[Hook]

[Vamp: Bilal]
The life we lead, will always lead us
And we pray that he, will never leave us
It's the price we pay, I guess that's the reason
Why my grandma sang, we all need Jesus [2x]

Misunderstood, don't let me be, misunderstood
Misunderstood, don't let me be, misunderstood
I'm just human



Yeah! The war zone. Who you fighting for?

[Verse 1: Common]
It's funk to rhythm and punk to rock
Loud like shot that come from a Glock
Pick up your mind, run from the spot
Revolution jumping in the parking lot
Shit is so hot that the sun watch
Children by the window with the gun cocked
They could get robbed and stop the luck (?)
Monkeys dance around for MTV spots
I lock into a-
Rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom
Experiment in stereo loud so crank the system
For the humble on the path I paint a vision
How far will a nigga go just for attention
And to be remembered, you forgot the mission
Listen!

[Hook: Laetitia Sadier]
All traces of life
In our gats we carry
That's used to dress humanity
(Common: it's a New Wave, Come on!)

[sung in French]
All traces of life
In our gats we carry
That's used to dress humanity
(Common: it's a New Wave, Dig it!)

[sung in French]
This life is precious
It's goddamn marvelous
Before it ever ends
(Common: it's a New Wave, Come on!)

This life is precious
It's goddamn marvelous
Before it ever ends
(Common: Come on! Come on!)

[Verse 2: Common]
I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera
For the people to make or wait it's better
In a room called real I stay forever
Everyday I lose something I gain forever
Meditate on how I can change the weather
My brainstorm for some it's like (?) umbrella
Where bullets and lies both spray together
My mind scream like Al Green "Let's Stay Together"
How could a nigga be so scared of change
That's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange
Ya'll rich, we could beef curry in the game
Out your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name
You seen what happened when the Com go BANG
Wouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range
Seen hype become fame against the grain become main-stream
It all seems mundane in the scope of thangs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Common]
From a land of shit talk, boy stars and pitch forks
Didn't really see white until I went North
Getting bent off in backyards, wishing in the air for a black god
Where people fix cars and clap hard
And look to the stars for rap jobs
I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots
Smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops
That master anger and ain't afraid to shoot
Through poured liquor fallen angels they salute
(Whew! Whew!) Feel the wind blow
A new wave- people with their hair trimmed low
It's two ways living in this world of techno
This age can't really save the ghetto
I pause for the rebels who rock heavy metals
And tell them that they're pharaoh so let go
Come on!

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Sitting on stairs, in street affairs
Jordan Airs, he got at least seven pairs
His voice rare, talk with a mumble
Chicago Bear hat, quarterback the huddle
Call an audible of trouble came
His name Chris, black as his hustle name
Reaction to his chains, it's like a basketball game
Watch him winning, hope your team do the same
A menace, he O-Dog, Caine
Wish a nigga would go against his grain
Used to staying but moved up in the game
Take a nigga spot, take a nigga fame
The fortune of a caine, long live his reign
He do it for a son, he do it with a gun
Whatever he do, yo, he do it till it's done
A team full of hitters, so they hit and run
The priest don't even want none
Walk with the G's cause the G's never run
Something to be from the slum and be the one
This is where he at, this is where he from

[Hook]
Where I'm from (x16)

[Verse 2]
Living life with no fear
Putting that truth in my baby girl's ear
Told her that dudes gon' want some ass
And whatever you do, do it with class
She wanna E, but to me, you gotta earn it
You can't circumvent life, you gotta earn it
It's the circle of life, that's why we're turning
Yo, I hit a choir and a sermon, our messiah is returning
With a tile around my neck, a style around respect
Know the smell of good pussy and the sound of a tec
They fire, drill, stop dropping roll
I popped out the cold hip-hop, that was gold
The way of the road is our ode to the legacy
C'mon dog, you know my pedigree
Finding Forever, Be, the sun never set on me
Many reign, but the game never weather me
If I'm in the building it mean I got equity
Where articles are black like Ebony
Since I was a shorty I was thinking longevity
No fear, I say that with levity

[Hook]



[Hook x4]
[?] don’t stop
[?] their trap
Hand in the pot
Baby, that’ll do it

[Verse 1: Common]
I’m from Chicago, nobody’s smiling
Niggas wyling on Stoney Island
Where the chief and the president come from
Pop out, pop pills, pop guns
On the deck when the ops come
Pop some, ops run
This ain’t a game nigga, ain’t no options
Nigga selling on the block like an auction
Dig into my pockets, see a profit
Where the money and the bitches is where the guys is
Godfathers in the lodges, at the spot holding money like a hostage
She went ostrich, from the projects with posture
I draw with the goddess like an artist
Getting paper with no margins, money gods
I do it for Hadiya and Trayvon Martin

[Hook][x4]

[Verse 2: Common]
In the Chi ain’t a damn thing funny
Thinking of ways to get money
Drive down Lake Shore, scheming how to make more
If we ain’t eating together what is this cake for?
Ain’t nobody giving it, that’s what we take for
Niggas is broke, what I need to brake for
Glaciers of ice, lazers and lice
Let the chains glow heavy, we paid for 'em twice
Made for the life, fall out like we out of bounds
Bars and guns, niggas got a lot of rounds
Tripping like you from out of town
The four pound will leave you on the ground without a sound
Ain’t no fathers round, sons of anarchy
Fighting attempts, trafficking, and grand larceny
At the party with the thots with the extra body
I’m in the inner city, it’s an out of body experience

[Hook][x8]

[Verse 3: Malik Yusef]
Face on T-shirts with no hashtags
Just big ass trash bags tagged hash
Out here shit been trill
Fake ass gangster, quick to take a fag’s cash
Five versus six, Star Wars
No stickers, real bullet holes in car doors
Out of ten people that was shot, 7 ate 9’s
Two trey 8’s, and one 45
Tryna get to 23, numbers game
Then here come the fame
But they won’t say no names
Are these celebrities way too shy to be loyal to the town
I take my publishing check and spread my royalties around
Popes, bishops, disciples, stones
Counts, princes, lords, queens and kings
They drilling on my land but ain’t no oil to be found
I might be part of the problem
I guess they just tryna prove they can back that shit up
Most of them can’t even moonwalk
My little cousin Bump J don’t know what he did when he introduced that goon talk
Is there a Scarface casting at the crib I don’t know about?
So many shortys have tried out for the role
That’s why he slide out and ride out with the pole
Now I see how my daddy felt the dark day he discovered that black power didn’t keep the lights on
Right on, the dearly departed still rapping to you
Looking for some yellow, white, red, black, brown flesh to write on
How long will they mourn me after I’m out of mind, out of sight, gone
A crash, a head on collision affects both riders the most
G.O.O.D. music in the building, yeah we got ghost writers
They just actually ghosts



[Instrumental]



[Verse 1: Common]
Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces
Plastic bag carryin', no two paces
IPhone, belt by Gucci
Bands with loose change and some car keys
To the Maserati, license plate read "God Body"
Passenger side only ride hot bodies
When we was young as we wanted, show our bodies
Cadillac come from the Southside army
The army now, don't try to harm me now
It's my time, you can't alarm me now
I ball, bitches wanna palm me now
Vacation in palm tree style
In the morning where the dons be now
Drinkin' lattes, over breakfast I pray and end it with a Ashe
Cops say we lookin' for a nigga thats dressed nice
Seats be goin' way back like Just Ice
Black leather wearin' "justice" on the collar
Change is we only ain't trustin' the dollars
Try to get me, get wet like bed sheets
Probably with technique, and let the Tec speak
Like the [?] conference I rap off the head conscious
Freestyle, free trap niggas from bondage
Every word you heard is bond is
Double-0 87, on some Bond shit
I'm out on bond

[Hook]
Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond)
Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond)
Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond)
Preposterous chains, top notch dames

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces
Los Padrinos to juvenile placement
Known for C-notes, the feds confiscatin'
Back to that block with brains on the pavement
Paid restitution, O from the lootin' enter
Cause they did it, you was influenced
Your mind gone, life don't seem much bigger
Than your time zone, broke as the rich get richer
Blunt burnt lips and a worn out liver
That's everyday livin', guns everywhere chillin'
Got you feelin' like this money comin' sooner than later
'Til then I'll be runnin' from the judge and the bailiff
Crime commitin' cause these women love a man in Mercedes
I never save for when it's rainy, hope Jehovah can save me
While I'm out on bond tryin' to buy my time
'Til I hit the main line in that cell confined

[Hook]

[Outro]
Preposterous chains, top notch dames
Classic rap music, rollin' in the Range
Preposterous chains, top notch dames
Classic rap music, rollin' in the Range



Yeah... ohhh... (3x)

[Hook: Bilal]
Ohhh...
Everything's gone be alright
If you play your cards right
Everything's gone be alright...

[Verse 1: Common]
It's do or die, your looking through the eye of a revolver
I revolve around the world, a problem solver
Alter your ego, and the way your walkin'
Talk to people, still I stay regal
Read through the bullshit
Sometime to make peace, you need a full clip
Roll dice with niggas who got bricks at a good price
Talk shit, give good advice, rollin' through the 'hood right
It's the good life, like T.I. said
Gettin' it, how could I not be fed
Get bread, get dough, get fed, get mo'
In the old school Lincoln, thinking I sit low
Let problems burn slow away
I yearn for the day that it won't go gray
Remember we were kings, back in the day
Still can be, depending on the cards you play

[Hook 1: Bilal (repeat 2x)]
If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right)
Everything... gone be alright (well... alright (3x))

[Verse 2: Common]
I ain't playin' with a full deck
The government won't let me get a full check
I'm taxin' marks, I got more heart than clubs
The black spade, givin' 'em darker love
Make 'em strip, like poker poker mag in his face
You tried to smoke my ace, you know the stakes
It's high like the ace is
Get your squad face down like cards, before they get a facelift
You get robbed, better yet jacked for diamonds
Leave you nickle-less, like Jack in "Shining"
Blocked your bluff, now your respect is stolen
Took your chips, let my guys in Texas Hold 'Em
Rolled the strips of Vegas, with money boss players
Stacey Adams of different flavors, we major
Gangstas and hustles, living moviestar life
Dealt a bad hand, but I played my cards right

[Hook 1: Bilal (repeat 2x)]
If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right)
Everything... gone be alright (well... alright (3x))

[Hook 2: Bilal (repeat 2x)]
Ohh...
If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right)
Everything's... gone be alright (well... alright (3x))

[Accapella: Bilal]
Yeah... Ohhh...

Everything's gone be alright, if you play your cards right
Everything's gone be alright...



[Pops]
Yeah, yeah, bring it on
Uh huh, with the ya ya, yeah
Just sitting around kicking it a little bit
I thought we would record something tonight
And I do want to dedicate it to two very outstanding people
I live the spirit of
Gentlemen Crispus Attucks and Mr. Marcus Garvey
Thank you so much

The Believer
If I were a believer, I believe I would believe in the beginning
Everybody's beginning
Mine, that my very first ancestors were front row and present
When God stepped to the mic
I believe from the creation of the Garden of Eden
The separation of the tribes
Our long marches across the desert
Being Yacub's kids
For instincts born in caves of ice
All, each and every one, the souls of one God
Granted earthly existence to allow each to earn
The blessing of transcending, time-traveling throughout the universe
With the blessings and well-wishes of my fathers, prophets of my own
No search, no fear no mysteries
We inherit the power to turn nightmares into dreams
For those of us who come from less than enviable circumstances
Dreams, good dreams, sweet dreams, dreams come true
Truthful dreams, truthful dreams become life
Life becomes belief, belief becomes live!
Live the life you believe
The American dream, the black American dream, the universal dream
For the sake of the unwritten laws of humanity, I believe in God
I believe in my ancestors, I believe in my offsprings
I believe in Dr. Sebi, I believe we must stop Willie Lynch'n each other
I believe in the truth, truth
See you next lifetime



[Verse 1: Common]
A nigga told me only rhyme for 19-year-olds
Nigga, you should rhyme wherever the spirit goes
Here it goes, lyrical miracles
These are pyramids from the imperial
In theory, though, low end scenario
And sound boy burial drove me to classic material
Aerial nights blew my mind out of stereotypes
For ethereal heights, I write like Richard
Invisible man, pictured below with the hieroglyphicable
Prolifical flow, on the walls where the mystics of Kemet would go
Supreme wisdom in my system is the kick in the door
I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin' though
This is a ritual for those depicted as low
Now I passed life like I've been here before
The reincarnation of It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold
Us Back, coldest raps
For me the globe is like a culdesac
Around the world in a day, find forever and I stay
I'm from the weather where they spray
There's gotta be a better way, people dying every day
Wonder what would heaven say
The devils need to get away
From Chevrolet to Escalade, from evergreen to the everglades
I kneel where the rebels prayed
Seen 50 grey, but they need better shades
Niggas rhymin' like their whole style in retrograde
The escapade I'm on is like when the sun, moon and stars was born
It's hard to explain how these pyramids formed

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard (sample)]
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll burn, I'll burn, and I will burn, burn, burn

[Verse 2: Common]
I arrived on the planet, never took the Southside for granted
Smoke a little, keep a high standard
The Roots are my niggas so got a fly band with
Son of the sit-ins, you know who I stand with
Dude said I was a hero, I ain't nothing but a sandwich
A gluten-free one at that, close my eyes see my raps
My bio is feedback from what we need rap
On some Marshawn Lynch, let me run it back
And come with that new black spiritual
Every rap's a miracle, condition now critical
Can't lack lyrical, we need black generals
Holy war, tap into you like Savion
But I'm a orator, the corduroy boy
Came the door-to-door name down the corridor of fame
I walk like an Egyptian on a mission to listen to conditions
Envision a vision of what we wishing
I've been commissioned to deprison the prism of your mind
Spit the wisdom of the one devine
Close encounter of the wonder kind, front a line
Shift the paradigm with a pair of rhymes
Styled by Michaela in the suite with Caroline
Getting dressed up under pressure, Alabama Shakes on
Incense rising from the dresser
Child of a fresher God
Influenced by the life of the former, Joanne Chesimard
Assata Shakur, I gotta do more
The light-skinned spook who got in the door
I got in here for the same thing Cassius Clay uses pottery for
I'm on a world tour with Muhammad the prophet, my man
And where we land the pyramids stand

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard (sample)]
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll burn, I'll burn, and I will burn, burn, burn



[Intro: John Legend]
The wind against my face, tells me that I must go
Can't stay around too long before my tracks gonna catch me
When they do, I've got to be somewhere in LA
So I can look at the sun and get my thinking done
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain

[Verse 1: John Legend]
The last note I sang was in Beaver Falls, PA
At some old and shabby bar, I never knew the name
But I knew I could and work that  all on my dreams
They tell me find that place, find that place

[Hook: John Legend]
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Deep in my destination, trying to find my destination
With LA so far away and I'm soaking cold today
Constantly it's on my mind
I'm only halfway there, I'm not caring how much frustration
Oh, I've got to cross this nation

[Hook: John Legend]
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

[Verse 3: Common]
As the rain falls down from the heavens
Think of how far I came since '87
Took my hustle and made it a weapon
I was always told "in the pain there's a blessing"
Mistakes that I made, they mirrored the lessons
Talking with God, I asked clearer questions
Dear Lord, is this what I'm destined for?
If so? Then what am I stressing for?
We tight, then why can't I let it go?
Everything gon' be alright, it's more than a metaphor
Let it rain cause it's ancestral
Cleanse my heart so they can see the best in you
Let it rain and come down visceral
For those no longer here in the physical
Let it rain cause it's like tears from you
Just like the rain, I'll do what I'm here to do
Let it rain, I know that it's purposeful
So that it can service you and return to you
Let it rain, let the rain surround me
And never drown me, I was lost when it found me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream, a dream is where I'll be

[Hook: John Legend]
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain



[Verse 1]
Bow! Bow!
I came through the door with the raw Martin Margiela
Superstar status, everything stellar
With some bad bitches and some ex-drugs sellers; niggas already jealous
We in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers
She already wanna pick, bitch don't be so over zealous
Go to the bar to get around like a propeller
The barmaid's name is Stella
I'm so appalled like McCartney that you would card me
Am I really mad? Hardly, I'm here to party
Wanting y'all to give me body like Lati-fah
Niggas in the corner smoking that ree-fah
Seen a girl she had bottom like a spea-kah
Wanna put some hands on her like a prea-cha
Hmmmm! Well let me take my time
She ordered Bacardi, getting twisted in the limelight
Seen that ass cause I got hindsight
She was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight
'Bout to get that invite to a night over Egypt
She said "You rap?" Yea mummy
I'm Tutankhamun kicking and spending this rap money

[Hook x2]
Feels so good
I wanna touch somebody
So let's go, go
Wanna feel you close, keep touching

[Bridge x4]
La la la la la, how you like it

[Verse 2]
She was all couture, in a Tom Ford
Security guard let me in cause I'm lord
Of finesse, the under, the rings, the dress
Code is to always stay fresh
Aware of a chest cause I stay abreast
She was extra cold, I'm here to de-congest
This nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess
Knocking over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled
I'm locked into my mood, long as dude don't disturb my groove
I won't have to take it back to high school
Rewind! No need to take me back in time
Keep my mind on the grind and the great feline
Cause what's in front of me is this behind
Up north she's thick, down south she's fine
Tuned in to what I'm doing
I'm so unassuming when I'm pursuing
The ladies, the ladies, a soldier of love like Sade
Showing love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me
Saw me talking to slim and started acting shady
Dude got foul like crack in the 80s
Uh, uh, uh, uh! You don't wanna test this yo
You never know who got a Tec up in the disco
"You Hollywood." Nah nigga, I'm Chicago
So I cracked his head with a motherfucking bottle

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x4]

[Hook: Elijah Blake]
You niggas ain't real
I think you need to stop pretending
These niggas ain't ill
We know the deal
Niggas ain't on
Here today and the next you're gone
Cuz you niggas ain't real
And we know the deal
Yeah we know the deal

[Verse 1: Common]
87 strip walker, I'm a shit talker
Fuck all night, yo, depending what I’m off of
Had a white girl I tossed her, black girl I lost her
Break bread with the Stones I'm the rock of Gibraltar
Salt of the earth for what it's worth yo from birth
I was first with a verse, live niggas don't rehearse
Wear the prophets on the shirt, yeah, yeah that's the creed
I can give a fuck if it's real or a weave
I tell you when you look good and keep it right there
I'm as important to the Chi as my nigga Mike Air
Jordan 3s on the feet as we breeze down Lake Shore
These are the days that we bake more to make more
I been living in the moment lately
It's like the love and the hate seem to motivate me
Lady lady, that body crazy
You been working out of this thing, if you're not tell me if you're really real

[Hook: Elijah Blake]
You niggas ain't real
I think you need to stop pretending
These niggas ain't ill
We know the deal
Niggas ain't on
Here today and the next you're gone
Cuz you niggas ain't real
And we know the deal
Yeah we know the deal

[Verse 2: Common]
I'm the sole controller, opposite of sober
Flow from the south side to south Angola
Mami wanna strip, then yeah, I'ma poke her
And go all in and stretch it out like yoga
I'm flexing, sexing, oiled up like Texas
Survivor, soldier, a child is destined
A star is born in a Chicago storm
The name is Common, I'm anything but the norm, uh
Six in the mornin' something warm informin'
I'm sweating like I'm performin' on tour and
Y'all fucking with this like porn
Put your fists up, cause you know I ride on
New planes and plateaus, made it through the black hole
I rhyme in a timeless capsule, I rap for
Niggas in the barber shops and broads that's hot
I run the town, I'm a fucking juggernaut
This shit is real

[Hook: Elijah Blake]
You niggas ain't real
I think you need to stop pretending
These niggas ain't ill
We know the deal
Niggas ain't on

We know the deal
Niggas ain't on
Here today and the next you're gone
Cuz you niggas ain't real
And we know the deal
Yeah we know the deal



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, you know how me and 'Ye do

[Verse 1]
Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people

[Verse 2]
I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people

[Verse 3]
Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin' the sky
Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye
I live across from it, some of it I do be in
I be showin' niggas lives
Like UPN
It's real people

Yeah
For you and yours
Good music
Forever
Yeah
Rock on
We keep on
Uh.. Yeah
Yeah, yeah
The real...



[Verse 1: Syd]
Red wine time on the couch
Happy you agreed to hang out
Keep my head in the clouds
Keep them old names out your mouth
I can make you laugh out loud
We the only ones in the house
I can help you body wind down
Make this bottle disappear right now
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Let's stay in for the night
Maybe take a walk outside
Let's distance your pride
Me fall in love with your mind
If I look deep in your eyes
I can guess your zodiac sign
We ain't got nothing but time
We can just chill and unwind
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable

[Verse 2: Common]
Freedom is the road less traveled by the multitude
The mood, it's the mode, it's the culture
Where there's food there's vultures
More Tony now, back then I was Sosa
I was sent like a penny in a loafer
The 2Pac Deepak Chopra
On a plane drinking wine with Oprah
When I missed the dap I ain't mean to insult her
Black Caesar, ey o amo roma
Tuto biene vino rosa
My dominican girl she loves soca
Take her to Minetta take her to the MOCA
Most of my friends at home that I'm close to
When they talk, put it on stone like a sculpture
Used to be a hooper, now I'm a hoper
Thoughts I bring to life like an ultra sound
I'm bound to the underground
Breaking walls down for the black and brown
A activist is active now
How far will you go for exposure?
Little homie in the paint tryna post up
Don't make me have to put you on a poster
Posterized by what I vocalize
Weathered the storm like I know the skies
Yea we wear the mask but I know no disguise
These signs of the times are notarized
Written by the lord of the skies mortalized
In us, I got cold through cruel winters
Grandmas, defenders, Fred Hamptons agenda
Never been good with pretenders
They lying on the king like Simba
Dinner, branzino and red wine
Quality shared time
Fucking and laughing 'til its bed time

[Verse 3: Elena]
Red like my lips
Blue like past thoughts
Brown like your eyes
Just enough time
I can't think now
You're too close and I…
Might be too nice
These New York nights
Got me taking chances
I think your hands
Might look just right
If they held mine
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get two glasses
Now I'm swimming
Off the deep end
Heightened senses
No pretending
Make my head spin
I like dancing
In my bedroom
It's just me and you
Put that tape on
Tell me what you want
Let's just make time feel, long
Get comfortable, get comfortable
You could just stay for the night
Here, let me turn down the lights
Get comfortable, get comfortable
You can let go
Passion comes from down below
We go together like so
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Let's make a toast
That we both can make the most of this time
Red wine

[Hook]
Rewind that one time please (x2)

[Verse 1]
Should it be, can it be simple?
Life is like the tempo of a No-I instrumental
Things that we been through define who we are now
Since "Can I Borrow a Dollar?"
Ooh, I'm a star now, coming from Chi-town
We was the first to do it
Me, No I.D., Twilite Tone on the music
The city on our back, we was the opening act
Throw our tapes in the crowd, they throw 'em right back
But we stayed on track, they stayed on the tracks
I stayed on the raps 'til we made it on the map
By then, No I was my main guy
He and I was like Chi-town's Gang Starr
We had came far together, with a long way to go
Seeing a bigger picture, but now from different angles
Tangle of the hustling, survival in the game
Felt I had to leave home to be a household name
Show money low, needin' to stack fast
City did have my back, now it's a backlash
Was I a slave to the cash and wanting it so bad?
I just became a dad, rap was all I had
So I moved to New York, to make it pop
Did Like Water for Choc, that album changed a lot
But my man who I started with, wasn't a part of it
And his presence I didn't even acknowledge it
Knew I was wrong, he shoulda at least had a song
It wouldn't be me without No I.D., and Twilite Tone
Wishin' I could get that time back
Oh I can, yo man, rewind that
Me and Dion back in the zone, I'm doing shows with Tone
For the future of the Chi we gon' bring it back home
Rewind that and we could do it again
No I.D., Twilite Tone, where the story begin

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This one's for my man J Dilla
As I say these words, my eyes fill up
Cuz wasn't non' realer than James  Dewitt Yancey
So I'mma dedicate this to Dilla and his family
In Q-Tip's basement, I first met Jay Dee
I still remember the first beat he played me
He came to the Chi laid three that was crazy
Didn't even know me and gave 'em to me for free
I got the the D, "peace yo, big love"
Cook up some hot shit, then go to the strip club
Then we made "The Light" and times got brighter
I said "turn it up" Jay'll take it higher
One day, I noticed he was tired quick
That's when I found out, Jay Dee was real sick
Things got worse before they got better
I said, "Come to L.A. for peace and good weather"
We got an apartment just so we could spark it
MP in the front room, records in the closet
The beats got iller, but the sickness was still there
I'm wishing I could will him out of his wheelchair
It was hard for me to come home every day
And see my homie Jay's life fade away
I stayed away some times, in other words I ran
Til one day J brought me this TV stand
It was a gift so I couldn't refuse it
It came from his heart, I regret I didn't use it
The lupus got worse and, for what it's worth
I wanted him to have a Grammy before he left this earth
Wishing we could have that time back
Oh we can, yo man, rewind that

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You never gone, you live forever through song
I feel it when I seem 'em with them Dilla shirts on
I know you're still shining, from heaven you watch me
Watch me put this Grammy on the stand you got me

[Outro]
(Common)
That's the infinite team right there, me and Jay Dee, I'mma work with him whenever I can, cause he's just like, constantly progressing and growing. He's one of the greatest producers... greatest musicians of our time. For real, I really know that

Like, I used to be able to wake up in the morning and hear J Dilla beats being made. You know, I really, really used to walk by and be like, "Man, I'm blessed." I really felt that, like, during the time when he was making it, not like, I don't look back and have to say "I was blessed, I know I was blessed." But during that time I looked and say man, I'm gonna see Jay Dee make beats every day, you know, as long as he was healthy, he was making music

(J Dilla)
Common, ok for me, ok it's definitely not a Common album
But, it's Common



Y'all let um know
I'm the coldest MC Joe you dig

So cool, so cool
I wanna move
So cool, so cool

I was raise in city where the blood is cold
Big hats Cadillacs and we love some gold
Looking for something real something pretty to hold
I'm king so I wrote livid imperial souls
I can tell you one them undercover video hoes
The way you shake I might just give you a role
Radios TV stole the soul
Now these playa's in the game really don't know they role

So cool, so cool
I wanna move
So cool, so cool

You tryin' to look real sexy
You wanna get some lovers
You know your stomach's too big
For you to be wearing them hip hugger
You need to work it out work it off juke it out
And use your mind the way you use your mouth
I'm from a stripper hustler with names like Chip and Buster
Come to the crib with that bogus
Them boys will nip and tuck ya
Are you a righteous brother
Still I might just touch her, build her and destruct her
Come with heat that'll burn like Usher

So cool, so cool
I wanna move
So cool, so cool

Rockin' don't stop it now, uh
Rockin' don't stop it now, uh
Shock it don't stop it now, uh

So cool, so cool



[Intro: D'Angelo]
Ohhh, ohhhh
I wanna get closer to you, baby
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh

[Hook - D'Angelo]
You have come so far
You've got so far to go, yeah
Say it again
You have come so far
You've got so far to go, yeah

[Verse 1 - Common]
Sweetheart, you know that you most
Important, at least on the West Coast (Huh!)
I'm just trippin', it's somethin' about your throat
You think different and understand how I float
Got cribs on both Coasts
But, I'm a Chicago-getter
You get down, but you ain't a golddigger
You got the soul with the figure to match
Your girlfriend said, "Yo, that dude is a catch!"
Creative with the gifts, plus he hit it from the back! (Ugh!)
And places we ain't supposed to
We make the music - baby, you on the vocals
International lover, I never stay local
Go to places that you never been
Beautiful outside, even better when it's in
You have arrived, girl - you can come again!
C'mon!

[Hook - D'Angelo]
You have come so far
You've got so far to go
Say it again!
You have come so far
You've got so far to go
OHHHHHHHHHHH!

[Verse 2 - Common]
You sexy, I know brothers try to spit to you
But, I'm the only one that can get to you
Lifting you, my drive is shifting you
I opened you free, it's like a gift to you
I truly am thickly and thankful
And as long I'm in your town, I'mma stay
+Faithful+ (Heh!)
You know I can't escape you
No matter how far, you're still my star
You was there when the marks tried to steal my car
Snappin' with me, that's just how real you are
Sophisticated woman, you understand a man
You don't call all the time just to see where I am
Put a "G" in your hand, make sure you're livin' alright
Makin' love is me and I'mma give it all night
Turn over in the morning, make it warmer and better
Long as we can be, we can come together
C'mon!

[Hook - D'Angelo]
You have come so far
You've got so far to go
I don't believe you heard me, baby!
You have come so far
You've got so far to go

[Bridge - D'Angelo]
Go on, go on then!
Go on - go on, girl!
Go on, go on - go on, baby!
Go on, baby!
Go on, girl!
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

[Hook - D'Angelo]
You have come so far
You've got so far to go
You know what I mean, baby!
You have come so far
You've got so far to go
You have come so far
You've got so far to go
You have come so far
You've got so far to go



[Intro]
Yeah, for the world!
Keep going so you can(yo you can rock on)
We keep going so you can (yo you can rock on)
We keep going so you can (yo you can rock on)
We keep going

[Verse 1]
Nigga breathe, I can tell by how you rap you don't believe
Ain't hungry no more, so off me you feed
I hustle at a speed between greed and need
On the streets where intuition and weed are breed
Shoot the gift and viff, at the myths uplift
My rhyme the clip its like the boom bip to tip
In gangways where cats that rhyme the same way
Spending nights over Egypt to learn a brave day
Paint a picture of the ghetto like J.J
You're the Ray J of this rap world, I travel the globe with a black girl
Named Becky, grand like Auto Theft 3
Style so developed, the law can't arrest me
You walk with blood on your shirt like Jesse
Jackson trying to test the reaction of the people
See through, trying to out act Don Cheadle
I speak to original Hebrews, you know how we do
And bleed through the needle with truth that needs no preview to proof; it's in the people
And how they react still in the business of smacking
Rappers is wack you had a dope track, I guess opposites attract
My mind state is black, Black like Bernie Mac
No cowards soul power in the words we rap

[Verse 2]
Picks with fist, thick grease, dark nipples
My guy buy ice, I search for the dark crystal
Racing for paper these broads is starter pistols
I spit through gang wars and strange doors
Out the sky flames pour the beats claims war
I see niggas with flags; who they waving them for?
I'm the nigga that you put the chain on the door for
The nigga that you started changing the lock for
Orator of hardcore and more
My raps the portal for the blue collar
Than made a hit and came up on a few dollars
I'd rather listen to silence then you holla
Borrowed your persona from the late that made Dear Mama
My realness is my armor that I wear up in this boy
For truth your a decoy
Common Sense is like the future of the B-boy
I fall down and get up like Don McClurkin
Hit puss and listen to it whistle while I'm twerkin'
Break it down like herb
The nympho of info I'm fucking what you heard
You ain't ready for war, you're stuck in the reserves
I mastered my high so I'm bucking at the birds
I been wanting to fly so now I do it with the words
For those in the fast-lane I show you how to merge
Get your own; you see, it's like home grown herb black economics
The people we serve with Soul Power



[Intro: Kanye West]
La, la, la, la, la and everybody say
La, la, la, la, la I know you, I know you

[Kanye West]
I know you're thinking, thinking that it must be
Armor All flow cause it never get rusty
I ain't gotta say it, man, dog, trust me
Bust somebody head, GLC, where was we
Still rock the Prada, 'fore that, rock the Starter
Niggas had the Georgetown, the Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects, and they way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a project, and come back and tear the mall up

[Hook: Common + Kanye West]
We coming from the Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, side of the Chi

[Verse 1: Common]
The broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars
I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars
Come to the crib with conflict diamonds and they ours
Back in '94 they call me Chi-town's Nas
Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods
We eatin' Joe, you still talkin' no carbs
A conscious nigga with mac like Steve Jobs

[Hook: Common + Kanye West]
We coming from the Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, side of the Chi

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Your fly is open, McFly
The crowd is open, I think I know why
I'm back from the future seen it with my own eyes
And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons
Look at that neutron on his green like croutons
People asking him, "do you have any Grey Poupon?"

[Hook: Common + Kanye West]
We coming from the Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, side of the Chi

[Verse 3: Common]
You in the building but the building's falling
You wouldn't be ballin' if your name was Spalding
My mind get flooded I think about New Orleans
Bout to school y'all niggas, you should call him August
I'm the sun that goes down but I'm still revolving
Southside walk it out, while still you're crawlin'
If rap was Harlem, I be James Baldwin
With money in the bank like G. Rap, we're calling

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Can't wait till they say, "Ye ran up at the Oscars"
Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans gonna love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters, Holla
We some true Chi-town legends, accept no imposters

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Common]
The un-American idol, tower like the Eiffel
Lean wit it, rock wit it, Black like the Disciples
Know when to use a bible, and when to use a rifle
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle
Caught a case of robbery, and beat it, like Michael
Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku
I write to do the right thing, like Spike do
Through conflicts that's crucial and drama that's psycho

[Hook: Common + Kanye West]
We coming from the Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, side of the Chi

[Interlude: Kanye West]
La-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la, la

[Outro]
We’re coming from the—-hey
[scratches] Spice it up
You might have to spice it up
Spice it up, spice it up
Take your life and
Yo, we’re coming from the—-hey
We’re coming from the—-hey

Yeah, yeah, they like that, I write raps from on top of the world
Popular girls always wanna pop in my world
I pop out in the boroughs and go to L.A. to get hay
In the middle of the barn with a princess I laid
Yo, this type of shit happens every um, once in a while
You know I won't front with the style
Bring life to the party like a woman and child
From the land of the humble and proud, summers is wild
Ah! Made the unmade-able
Ah! Go to parties I'm paid to go
Me and cuzzo talked the hustle
About doing good business like Rick and Russell
You I know I guzzle red wine till it's bed time

[Verse 1: Common]
Let's do it now, it's me and you
Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you
Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you
Are you alone? Is your shorty sleep?
Hold on. That's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak
Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I reserve love
Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What he showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you

[Hook: Prince & Bilal]
(Erotica) Wet dreams are on my mind
(Erotica) Can I come in your mind?
(Erotica) Oh yes, our love must shine
(Erotica) Wish on star 69
(Erotica) Wish on star 69
(Erotica-ca-ca) Wish on star 69
(Erotica-ca-ca) Wish on star 69, erotica...

[Verse 2: Common]
So much I wish you were here with me now
My bad, I just hit redial
I want you to come and never leave now
Is your mind and your right hand free now?
Our love-reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns
Where desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we (ahh), feel the most high in it
I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me
Our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist
As I stare in your face
Your mouth half open
Your love I can taste
Embracin' you
Life: I let go
Gotta switch phones cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you

[Hook: Prince & Bilal]
(Erotica) Wet dreams are on my mind
(Erotica) Can I come in your mind?

[Verse 3: Common]
I want you to come
Inside your mind
And find a place
Nasty and kind
This is where
Our desires grind
And where they peak
Is most divine
A place and time
I hope we reach together
You are my queen
And freak forever
I feel you in-side my stomach
My body shakes...

[Verse 1]
Uhh, uhh
Ladies and gentlemen the C-O-double M-O-N
Synonym for fresh, truth is the emblem
Hardcore since I was next door to Clem and them
Cold as the winter when fake niggas was shiverin'
Shakin' in they Timberlands, you as played as Bennigans
Hot for a minute, now you just a "remember him"
I been a master since P was No Limitin
Stick to sayin'
No gimmickin' and no mimickin'
Q infinitin' down old blocks are bendin in
Yellin' "Fuck tha police" like Ren and them
Pelican brief these niggas on who I be
Before the paper and the fame niggas knew Rashid
Noble like Drew Ali
Many have come
But few have been chose to be a true MC
You sing along with it, inside you knowin' it's wack
Young who? Oh, he the openin' act

[Verse 2]
Let, let, le-le-le-le-le-let's go
It's a festival in hip-hop, we do it non-stop
Pop your bottles
Chicago niggas do it in staccato
Choppin' notes for my homies, fuck a motto
And Ferragamo shoes givin' dudes the model
Think fast, drive slow, survival is the throttle
Your live show is hollow, should've kept it local
Rappin' over vocals
Soundin' soft as JoJo
With twelve monkeys on stage it's hard to see who's the gorilla
You was better as a drug dealer
Feel the passion of this B-boy rationale
Half of it is what you say and half is style
I guess it's time for you to start cashin' out
It's over folks, tell your guys to put the glasses down
Masters now, verses touch the youth like a Catholic priest
Performances keep me stackin' the sheets

[Verse 3]
The name is Com I’m like a rebel in rap
Struggle music mixed with weed to make the ghetto react
I know they wanna Resurrect but I ain’t pedalin' back
They gangster stories just as real as Kevin Federline rap
I guess it’s Kramer and Bush that don’t care about blacks
Kinda wish it was some real niggas there that just snapped
Meanwhile in the mean world, hoes cry freedom and fiends url
I’m standing supreme like the Dreamgirls
And I’m tellin you like Jennifer Hudson
The law get outta pocket then I’ma be buckin’
Goin’ against me joe is self-destruction
I’m tired of y'all like my man is of hustlin’
Shuckin’ and jivin', gon’ do that dance nigga
30 with kids pull up ya pants nigga
I ran with the brothers from around the 7
I can tell who’s live by soundcheckin'



[Verse 1]
She walk into the court her knees buckle
Saying for a man to survive he needn't hustle
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his ho to his wife
Stifling, the night upend the ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustla, so she love them
Looked at the jury how can they judge him, she screamed

[Hook]
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

[Verse 2]
Fear in her chest her face in tears
Had her man's back he was facing years
In her name though the place was his
They tryna take everything except the kids
For years she been through stumbling fights
While he tryna hustle that white
Up all night wondering if he's alive
Seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The judge yelled for order the court
Reporter making her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him
She could see how the trial was affecting him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him
Using her lies for protecting him
They arrested him for murder and gun possession
As they read back her confession, she screamed

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup
He stated, he was guilty on all charges
She's shaking looking like she took it the hardest
A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind, testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime, the queenpin

[Hook]

[Outro]
You accuse me of a, you accuse me of a, you accuse
Please let me testify, please let me testify



[Hook: John Legend]
I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us

[Verse 1: Common]
These are the words of a believer
Achiever, leader of the globe
Feeding souls of those in need
I bleed the blood of the struggle
Walking over troubled puddles
Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress
Extremities of life and it's process
Birth of a son, death of another
With love I caress both mothers
And told 'em, who’s in control is the one that's above us
I walk where money talks and love stutters
Body language of a nation going through changes
The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger
Anger gets sent through the chamber
It’s tough when your own look like strangers
We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers
If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us?
Look at the picture, hard not to blame us
But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often
Do they end up in a coffin because we haven’t taught them?
Is it what we talking, we really ain't walking?
Dues hustlers pay, how much did it cost 'em?
Find myself on the same corner that we lost ‘em
Real talking, in they ear like a walkman
Thoughts spin around the corner to the world
When I see them, I see my baby girl
Believe!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
The lord lives among us, the younguns hunger
Become a means to get it by any ways nece-
-ssary, under pressure, children feeling lesser
With the steel up on the dresser killin' will aggressors
Destiny’s children survivors, soldiers
In front of buildings they eyes look older
Hard to see blessings in the violent culture
Face against weapons, sirens, holsters
That ain't the way that Langston Hughes wrote us
Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah
We go from being Precious to Oprah
Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas
Today and the way that you can see we determined
Solar keeps burning, shawty’s know to keep learning
Lesson’s in our life are like stripes that we earning
Took gramps' advice that Christ is returning
Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light
For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys
Street hits spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest
That seems beyond us, even through the unseen
I know that God watches
From one King's dream, he was able to Barack us
The prophets, nothing can stop us
Believe!

[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse 1: Common]
Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

[Hook: Kanye West]
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

[Spoken Word: The Last Poets]
We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins in
Yellow and pink and collared blue
Profiles glorifying them

[Verse 2: Common]
Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three stripes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

[Hook: Kanye West]
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

[Spoken Word: The Last Poets]
The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

[Verse 3: Common]
Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

[Hook]

[Spoken Word: The Last Poets]
The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
Down on the corner



[Verse 1: Common]
There's something 'bout this day that seem good to me
When niggas I ain't like is showin' love to me
Good food and the mood and the hood is free
Peace and free is the frequency
This is the day women took over
No longer over your shoulder do you have to look over
Imagine, war is now over
Mothers get medals for being courageous soldiers
On dollars, it's Michelle Obama, Oprah and Rosa
The mayor of the Chi is Liz Dozier
Hoods feel safer, families feel closer
We all drunk in love with no need to be sober
Ladies get their hair done, and men, we notice
You get high grade Indian weaves, at the lowest
Prices, chivalry is no longer lifeless
We openin' doors and pullin' out chairs again
Things are merry and there's more marryin'
Monthly free doses of Motrin and Valerian
For your menstrual, it's no more minstral shows
Depictin' women as ignorant simple hoes
It's more love songs on the radio
Respect for the ladies, you can hear it in the flow
Egos aside, for each other we rise
Since they done give us a life, the whole world feel alive

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Oh, when women take over the world
Oh, every man, woman, boy and girl
Oh, maybe one day, we will see
Peace and unity the way it's meant to be

[Verse 2: Common]
The day women took over, let it continue
Now women get paid as much as men do
Dr. Angelou's lookin' from Heaven's window
Tellin' young girls phenomenal woman is in you
Body is a temple, men don't prey
Mother earth's arms around you sayin' it's okay
Toilet seats down, that's a no-brainer
Monuments in Washington of Fanny Lou Hamer
Harriet, Sojourner's truth is marchin' on
Women preachers and world leaders, it now the norm
Healthcare, payin' for nails, jails and fill-ins
Intellectual buildin', intersexual healin'
No stickin' movers, and no quick shooters
After 15 minutes, callin' you a Uber
The New World Order is fathers lovin' their daughters
And baby's mamas supported and ladies gettin' courted
In court, kids can't be tried as adults
And women, they called bitches because they a boss
In all shapes and sizes, beauty is recognized
Goddess and queens is what we use to describe
Now Michelle Alexander wrote the new constitution
Beyoncé made the music for the revolution
Imagine it, a world more compassionate
The balance of the feminine and masculine, I'm askin' if

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Oh, what if women took over the world
Oh, every woman, boy and girl
Oh, maybe one day, we will see
Peace and unity the way it's meant to be



[Intro]
For the world, world, world
My name is Common, No I.D

[Verse 1]
Ferrari Testas, Armani dressers
Exquisite thick bitches that body bless us
Rest assured, we getting festive in Miami now
Told my nigga Ye, I'm about to win the Grammys now
Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now
Standing close to the mic like I'm Kobe now
We celebrate with shots of the hate because we got love
It's the pop life, a lot of faces pop up
Known to tear the club and the block up
Going through the airport with more lye than an opera
Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter
Get cleaners to get it cleaner
A legend like John, Lennon, I'm a dreamer
Tried to fuck the world she only let me finger
Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer
A hero, I'll drop out like Hiroshima
Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina
Still opening roads for Omoye and Amina
I'm a dreamer

[Hook]
It's for the world, world, world, world, world
Dream on

[Verse 2]
We take, uh, we make, uh, paper
And build skyscrapers
Walking on water, building my faith up
Niggas with no heart, I'm the pacemaker
Get the beat from No I, feel the pulse of the Chi
Survival of the fit with hope in they eye
Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the most high, so I gotta land them
Career ain't random, make anthems, streets chant them
Rock roles like a phantom
Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums
I tell them I need space like Richard Branson
Dancing, with wolves and stars getting full at bars
And then pass out like a pamphlet
Never taking Grants for granted
It's Common, I'm high above standard
Fly nigga, keep my feet planted
To rock the planet, I don't stop for panic
Maybe I'm a hopeless Hip-Hop romantic
I'm a dreamer

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
He introduced me, I stepped to the podium
Said peace, gave thanks to the holy one
Put my water up, thought about my daughter for a second
The youth, the living resurrection
Reflections of the sun glaring through the window
Now the audience staring at my mental
Feeling like the world, the world is at my fingers
'Bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean
Now it's gold records, and I'm on silver screens
At the mountaintop, you still gotta dream
To the dreamers

[Bridge]
If I dream you're here
And you dream I'm there
We'll be nowhere near
You should just come here
If I wake you up
Only difference is
You can live the dream
Just believe in it

[Maya Angelou]
Once you find your shoulders dropping
And your speech gets slow and hazy
You better change your way of being
Before you found your brain got lazy
You can build a better future when you join the winning team
If you desire a bright tomorrow, you must build a brighter dream
Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you
Know that history holds more than it seems
We are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream
From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships
And stood half naked on auction blocks
From eastern-Europe they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants
And were mis-named on Ellis island
From South America and Mexico, from Asia, they labored in sweat shops
From all over the world, they came to America
Many shivering in rags, and still they dared to dream
Let us dream for today and for tomorrow
Let us dare to dream



[Dave Chappelle]
Tonight's musical guest
Two of Chicago's Finest emcees!
Give it up for Common and Kanye West!

"It's Common Sense!"

[Intro - Common]
Yeah! "Common Sense!" - {*scratched*}
It's Common Sense! With Kanye West!
On the Dave Chappelle Show!
Everybody gotta eat right?
It's the food baby!

[Chorus - Kanye West]
I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money coming slow, but a least a - know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

[Verse - Common]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in em
Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims
We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it "Jump Off" like Kim and them
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling
Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them
Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him
He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him

[Chorus]

[Verse - Common]
It's all good in the hood, like raps and gems
Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts
We never fall short, wit us it's Our Force like And 1's
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe
Though I know to grow a - gotta learn to let go
Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind
Po' livin in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holding the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jobs get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Kanye West]
I - I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my - away
You can't front on me
I - no I can't let it ride
No no not tonight
See I can't run away or put my - away
You can't front on me

[*applause*]



[Intro: Common]
Yeah! It's been a long time comin'
You know what they say Kanye
Slow motion better than no motion

[Hook: Kanye West]
I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know

Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

[Verse 2]
It's all good in the hood, like rats in gyms
Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts or tires of all sorts
We never fall short, with us it's all Force like Air 1's
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, with self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the dough
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the dough I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on tarot cards pointin' to the grind
Po' livin' in more prisons, pointin' to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holdin' the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jaws get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I, I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
I, no I can't let it ride
No, no, not tonight
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me

[Verse 3]
I break bread with thieves and pastors, OG's and masters
Emcees and actors that seize and capture
Moments like the camcorder
You ain't killin' it, yo that's manslaughter
Though paper can't change a man's aura
It can feed a man's daughter
I stand for the blue collar, on the side makin' a few dollars
Like Sam Jack they maneuver through drama like

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I, I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
I, no I can't let it ride
No, no, not tonight
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me



[Hook - Samples]
"It's only right that I address this..."
"You gotta be in it to win it..."
"I never come lame type killin' in the game..."
"Now... get busy..."
"It's only right that I address this..."
"You gotta be in it to win it...."
"I never come lame type killin' in the game..."
"Hot music..."

[Verse 1]
Raised by game where niggas ain't phased by fame
Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain
Stay in your lane, Brokeback ain't the way of the game
My brainstorm is like I stay in the rain
My favorite was Kane, now I'm dope with weight in the game
You was hot but can't stay in the flame
Ghetto pain and windows crack, the fist is like a symbol for black
Can tell the real by how the real interact
In the middle of whack my soul sticks to a track
Kickback records get kicked to the back
I want big cribs and my man Ronnie to get his
Child in a good school and know what her gift is
It's global warming, the world is shifting
Watching Sweet Sixteen, Bitchin-ass rich kids
Who don't know in life you gotta go the distance
Whether yoga or doja, we all get lifted in the Game

[Hook - Samples]
"It's only right that I address this..."
"You gotta be in it to win it..."
"I never come lame type killin' in the game..."
"Now... get busy..."
"It's only right that I address this..."
"You gotta be in it to win it...."
"I never come lame type killin' in the game..."
"Hot music..."

[Verse 2]
I never kissed the ass of the masses, I'm the black molasses
Thick and I lasted past these rat bastards
They try to box me in like Cassius Clay
Hey I'm like Muhammad when he fasted
Opposing the fascist, make cuts and got gashes
Scratches over third eyelashes
Punchlines are like jab hits to rappers
Whose careers now ashes it's too many slashes
In his name, came in the game these gun-clappers
From weak lines to clothing lines to an actress
I seen 'em dashing smash hits
I yell run nigga run while I cook up classics
The weak hearted, become Babylon puppets
Making it hard for real hustlas
Touch the sky now and then, with a lady friend
Give thanks to the most that's how the day begins in the game

[Hook - Samples]
"It's only right that I address this..."
"You gotta be in it to win it..."
"I never come lame type killin' in the game..."
"Now... get busy..."
"It's only right that I address this..."
"You gotta be in it to win it...."
"I never come lame type killin' in the game..."
"Hot music..."

[Verse 3]
I just wanna be like Akeelah, an achiever
From the streets of the Chi where some get high for leisure
Selling weed out of cleaners
From rocks to barber shops and beemers
Chicks with blond weaves and strong legs like Serena
The demeanor of the Ghetto, to never stay settled
Aldermen and corrupt men play Pharaoh
GOOD bring business to the hood like Harolds
Five year olds walking by them self in the street
The young die of cancer, I stop eating meat
Greet the gods on 87th St. like peace
Even though it's war to G, got 'em facing the east
The game ain't tasting as sweet
Cats flow is still, and they complacent with beats
My radio station is deep, so eff 'em
Progression, counting paper and blessings in the game

[Hook - Samples]
"It's only right that I address this..."
"You gotta be in it to win it..."
"I never come lame type killin' in the game..."
"Now... get busy..."
"It's only right that I address this..."
"You gotta be in it to win it...."
"I never come lame type killin' in the game..."
"Hot music..."



[Verse 1: Common]
My eyes watch God from a place
Where times is hard, hard times we embrace
Everybody want a yard, cause a yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the metropolitan
The hustle is hollarin'
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollar and
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to profit like Solomon
The young play corners, Sean Jean modelin'
They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliment
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan
Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again
Aunties walking to liquor stores in moccasains
My guy got a gig, on the side he barberin'
Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle

[Hook]
[Common] Just put it in your back and hustle
The paper's stacked so hustle
[Omar] Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that
Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that
[Common] Just move, and shake, and grind and hustle
It's on your mind so hustle
[Omar] Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that
Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that

[Verse 2: Dart Chillz]
First to the third, I'm close to the curb
Toast to the bird, now I'm posted to serve
Heard is a verb when you pour dirt on the floor
Bill collecters and the roaches working your nerves
It's a ghetto truck for a ghetto boy
To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toy
So he can come so just work murder rate is increasin'
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent
And my rims blind the whole damn precinct
Everytime you see a head in my lap you know she sinked
I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think
Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink
Five went through me, two stayed in me to do my duty
Only thing that subdued me
Two weeks, same corner, new freaks
New geese, all white AND 1 new sneaks

[Hook]

[DJ Joe Sinista scratches bridge]
"Can't knock the hustle!" "The Hustle!" "I'm in"
"Im in" "I'm in too deep" "deep to sleep!" "Can't knock the hustle!"
"The hustle!" "Caught up in the hustle!" "I'm gettin' high"
"Can't knock the hustle!" "The Hustle!" "I'm in"
"Im in" "I'm in too deep" "deep to sleep!" "Can't knock the hustle!"
"The hustle!" "Gotta hustle up!" "I got to have it, have it...have it" (echos out)

[Verse 3: Common]
Some rhyme, some throw shows, some sew clothes
Some hobo at the junction in between cars
Some enter the functions in between stars
Some teach, some preach saying they seen God
Some put they money up, against mean odds
Flippin' real estate yo, stocks and bonds
Dreams of rollin Eldorados bumpin' El DeBarge
Whatever the dreams, stay on ya deem the world is ours, its the hustle

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[DJ Joe Sinista]
"Gotta hustle up!" "Stay hustlin'!"
"Gotta hustle up!" "Stay hustlin'!"
"Gotta hustle up!" "Stay hustlin'!"
"Gotta hus-" "hustle up!"
"Stay hustlin' hustlin' hustlin'!"
(echoes out)

[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
Thousand lives ago
We were young and we didn't know
We were trading our crowns for our souls
Made the sacrifice
Headed back to the light
But be careful don't drown in the gold
I know it glows but it's cold

[Sample]
I'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair

[Verse 1: Common]
Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones?
And Four CHs, Vice Lords, Stony Island on Aces
The concrete matrix, street organizations
They gave violations, hood public relations
It was the basics to get big faces
Stay away from cases, bad broads, good graces
The hustlers was the taste makers and trend setters
They the ones that fed us hopin' that the feds don't get us
The era of Reagan, the terror of Bush
Crack babies, momma's a push, we were the products of Bush
I'm wishin' for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci
A bad ho to bee-bee-bee do me, you heard of Flukey
Stokes, it was folks and coke and dope
Fiends choked off of smoke, herringbones and rope
Rare jewels of a generation
Diamonds, blinding us of real shit we facin'
Forties wasted on 'ceased, Dion makin' the beats
When they air it out on at the parties we escapin' the heat
I could break it down like whatever you need
He squinted his face and rolled the weed

[Interlude]
You know they don't see sometimes
That in the neighborhood
It's the exact same thing
It's the same thing over and over again
Feel me?

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Have you ever heard of no limit, three hundred, six hundred?
Folly boy, O block, eastside
Where it ain't no conversation they just let them heats ride
Can't nobody stop the violence, why my city keep lyin'?
Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying
Used to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign
I've been out there three days and I got shot at three times
Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine
I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind
I know haters wanna clap me up, watch the morgue grab me up
But they can catch me later, I been cool, chasin' paper
Where I come from ain't no hope if you was claimin' that was major
Small crib, big fam, mom was workin', granny raised us
No food in the refrigerator, I was bangin', pullin' capers, that's real shit
Same niggas from day one boy, yeah I'm still with
Better watch out for that jump shot cause they will hit
Homie take your shorty lunchbox, and won't feel shit
I came from a place where it's basic but you won't make it
Feds buildin' cases, judges who racist and full of hatred I mean
You ain't never seen the shit that I seen

[Outro]

Louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder
Louder, louder, Yeah
[Repeat]

Yeah, it's for the people

[Bridge: Common]
This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Ye' you know how we do, we do it for the people

[Verse 1: Common]
And the struggles of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was  harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end trying to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture
Everyday we hustlin', trying get them custom rims
Law we ain't trusting them, thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of punching it, I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touching them
The People

[Hook: Dwele]
The days, have come
Now we, are one
Just take, your time
And then, you'll find

[Bridge]
This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Ye' you know how we do, we do it for the people

[Verse 2: Common]
The people said that I was sharp on TV
At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what, the people gon' see me
Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe, until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise doing business with my guys
Visions realize, music affected lives
A gift from the skies, to be recognized
I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

[Hook: Dwele]
The days, have come
Now we, are one
Just take, your time
And then, you'll find

[Bridge]
This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Ye' you know how we do, we do it for the people

[Verse 3: Common]
From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana
I see the I in We, my nigga, yours is my drama
Standing in front of the judge with no honor
My raps ignite the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the people's sake
The People

[Hook: Dwele]
The days, have come
Now we, are one
Just take, your time
And then, you'll find



[Hook: John Legend]
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, They say...)
They don't knowwwww

[Verse 1: Common]
They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick, "Tell Cara get us a show"
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
They say "You ripped" "Wow..." Yea, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say "Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes"
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ahh... The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin' "Damn, Ye snapped with this beat!"
Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did D'Angelo ask em how do it feel!
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin I can't handle
So please don't ever give me records I can't sample
So I could vacate where it ain't no channels
But it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just gon check myself in - again

(Chorus) Kanye West: "Uh!" [hey!]

[Verse 3: Common]
They say "Dude think he righteous"
I write just to free minds, from Stony to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or Isis
They say "life is a game," so I play hard
Writin for my life cause I'm scared of a day job
They say "Sef kept the hood together"
I tell the young, "We can't play the hood forever"
Play my cards right, they say I went too left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim "King" like Don, or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ's
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say "The crochet pants and the sweater was wack"
Seen "The Corner", now they say "That nigga's back," uh

[Hook]



[Hook: John Legend]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Consequence]
See my life was kinda simple like Nicole and Paris
'Til i started making dollars like I rolled with Paris
Then we went our seperate ways like annulling a marriage
Cause they talk behind my back even worse than the past
Cause while i tried to make it happen they preferred an excuse
And that rubbed me the wrong way like a pervert masseuse
Cause nothing free about juice when you go to the market
So how you using mine just to corner the market
Now I'm more of a target than the items in Target
And matter fact homie I'm tired of talkin'
So if you got them killers what you need to do is send one
Otherwise start calling me Ben cause i been one
Cause 'Quence getting stung ain't in this package deal
So I'm screening all my calls like the actors deal
And since [?] in the hood is even higher than Dre Day
I could give a damn about the things that they say

[Hook]



[Hook: Bilal]
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

[Verse 1: Common]
I heard a white man's yes is a black maybe
I was delivered in this world as a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention and I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip, I watch the fat lady
Sing a song, on how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
They say we dreaming wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the Walgreens is gone, hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
It's hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave we afraid to
The same streets that raised you can age you
With other black birds that's caged too
A rage up in Harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child: maybe

[Hook: Bilal]
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

[Verse 2: Common]
He had game since he used to hoop at Chatham
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back
Now that's black...maybe

[Hook: Bilal]
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

[Interlude: Common]
When we talk about black maybe
We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from... from other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judged..you get laughed at... you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us... black maybe

Black maybe...

[Hook: Bilal]
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...



[Hook: PJ]
What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me
And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..
Why don't I take the time and then adore my baby doll?
Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want?
'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..

[Verse 1: Common]
Love never gave a limit, wait a minute, stay up in it
Every day we give it, play to win it, way we live it
My heart, you came to visit
Stay extended
The lap of love we lay up in it
Days is vivid same incentive
The way we hit it's like Will and Jada did it
A house is not a home unless we staying in it
Stay committed
I used to get around now I'm staying centered
Angels ascended, grounded, stay cemented
The mentality, we all casualties
I can't do this casually actually you challenge me
To balance me
Paid dues and salaries
Been through truths and fallacies
The unfamiliarity made me loose calories
In a house with wine playing Amy's "Valerie"
Then I realized the past ain't my reality
On love's balcony, you standing out for me
This is alchemy, unashamed and undoubtedly
Now I see

[Hook: PJ]
What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me
And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..
Why don't I take the time and then adore my baby doll?
Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want?
'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..

[Verse 2: Common]
This love's alive, it clicks the way that T.D. Jakes described it
Vivrant thing the way that Tip from Tribe would sing
So many things that you provide the king
You too fly, never should you hide your wings
The awakening, let's keep breaking things
Breaking rules, breaking laws, breaking through
Breaking walls, sacred thoughts
Are the oceans that we make it cross
The truth is a naked cloth
No need to take it off, the wait is off
Love we make and do is unbreakable, relatable
State in you relating to the faith in you
Awaken to what faith can do
Fate is inescapable, super friends, we capable
To take it to a greater view they say is unattainable
I paint for you a picture I'm forever in it with ya
Love it when we hang, in my life, you're a fixture
A mixture of love, laughter, scripture
The right elixir, my spirit I pour to enrich ya
I'm with ya

[Hook: PJ]
What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me
And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..
Why don't I take the time and then adore my baby doll?
Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want?
'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar

I could get used to it, I could get..



[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
If your eyes are the window to your soul
Open eyes bring the cold
If your dreams keep you warm in night
Baby just keep 'em closed
If your eyes are the window
I can sneak in at night
In your eyes I can see your soul
Staring back into mine

[Verse 1: Common]
She was a beautiful rose
From the concrete and heat she grows
In the dark room her life was exposed
Her picture of men, we walk on all fours
Heart opened and heart closed
Every now and then she sparkles
You can tell she was hurt by the words that she chose
I'm thinking like Lauryn, a rose is still a rose
Even when the door close, there grows a new one
I told her it's some good men, she asked me if I knew one
Her daddy left a hole because she never really knew him
Ok, sometimes from commitment, we do run
Rocking Lou Vuitton, said she focused on the Christian
I'm speaking to her trying to enhance her vision
But not to be married with kids she was wishing
Shhh, 'til your soul just listen

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
She said daddy take me ice-skating
Looking at the rear-view, life's waiting for her
Gotta be there to support her
Can't really wait for a court order
She got the type of aura that's fun and vibrant
A lot of love inside, got to help guide it
Daddy will protect it, God will provide it
We all will be there so your soul ain't divided
Man, how quick she grows
Looking like her momma but she got my toes
I suppose it's the age that she really really need me
A lot of girls without, they become needy
"Como on, Dad, I'm too old for the back seat
Can you come and get me, are you coming to my track meet?"
As she begins the race of life and love I told her
"I can't run it for ya, but God know's I'ma coach ya"

[Hook]



They’ve been using this system to will their power. So it's kind of like a slippery slope to teach their children, to teach your children, to respect something that shows no respect, for a lack of better terms...you know what I mean? You hit a good thing on the head, saying about how educating the youth early and often about relationships going forward



[Hook: Common]
State of the art, state of the drill
State of the mind, state of the city
I contemplate and rewind
State of the art, state of the mind
State of the city
I contemplate and rewind

[Verse 1: Common]
I put the line down when I put the rhyme down
Lost on my own Stoney Island that I'm found
I ride around town like this is my town
Rapping to myself, trying to see how I sound
Kinda arrogant cause I’m from Chi Town
East bound & down, that’s how we get down
At the bar taking shots like they live rounds
My lifestyle is it’s good to be alive now
Lot that surround me, places all cloudy
Came in the Audi, pied piper rowdy
You in the 'Raq where it's war like Saudi
Youngins carry the iron man, like Robert Downey
Pound the ground we own the concrete jungle
Surround me loudly, wildly is how we came up
Think about the come up
That’s why I’m always on edge when the fans seem to run up
Hair all done up, we can spend the summer together
But when the weather change, lady friend
You may be forever stranger lines seem to blur
Yea I like you but I still love her, uh uh uh
I come from the under, wonder why they slumbered on a nigga
Now I see the bigger picture, pour a little liquor
The rich get richer, my dick get bigger
Cause I’mma go hard, g-go g-go hard
The more I know self, the more I know God
Coppin’ land from my bro Monar
Good to do business with the bro-gods, let the dollar circulate
Lower the murder rate but still kill this shit
In touch with the crib that’s why you feel this shit
The willingness to grow, the willingness to blow
The willingness to know that I don’t know shit

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
But I still wanna know
What the fuck you on girl

[Verse 2: Common]
Enrichened souls, visions, goals, mission grows as I do
It was written like a haiku when I was seventeen
I used the syllables, y'all, to forever dream
Now I’m a Champagne King like Evelyn
Young hearts run free and forever sing
Yea

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
Tell me what the fuck you on
Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run

[Hook: Common]
State of the art, state of the drill
State of the mind, state of the city
I contemplate and rewind
State of the art, state of the mind
State of the city
I contemplate and rewind

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run

[Hook: Common]
State of the art, state of the drill
State of the mind, state of the city
I contemplate and rewind
State of the art, state of the mind
State of the city
I contemplate and rewind

[Common]
It was red, I guess it had to be the bloodshed
Love shed, ‘nough said

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
But I still wanna know
What the fuck you’re on
Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run
And I’m down to jump the gun with you
Tell me what the fuck you want
Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run
And I’m down to jump the gun with you

[Verse 3: James Fauntleroy]
What the fuck I’m s’posed to do, you not around
I’m not talkin' 'bout when you're high I mean on the ground
Always hold you down in and outta town
Maybe I’m a clown got me crying out in front the crowd
On the inside but it feel like a fuckin’ cloud
Out my fuckin’ mind, I’ma fuckin’ drown
Girl but I’m not gonna fuck around
I’ma fuckin’ marry you and learn to swim
Let me carry you I need to hit the gym
Young hard jab but the difference is
Got young love but I’m not young
Faith in love but I’m not dumb
I don’t need to give a fuck about the outcome
Niggas be scared but I’m not one

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Niggas be scared but I’m not one
Niggas be scared but I’m not one
Niggas be scared but I’m not one
Niggas be scared but I’m not one



[Refrain: Kanye]
Oh it can't Be
G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now I'm hopping out the limo or either the Lam B
But you niggas gon' get in 'til you get to Miami

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
GLC gon be stoned as Angie
I be Don C, Johnny Patron and me
It's a celebration bitches more bottles of cham-p-aign
In love with the same stripper that sprung T-Pain
And all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap mayn
Dawg I can't keep saying G.O.O.D music the greatest latest
Stunting out the middle of nowhere like Vegas
From the Chi, the city of hella haters
Where we keep rising to the top like elevators
Hi haters I'm back off hiatus I feel just like you I mean even I hate us
Turn the radio down I mean every song
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on
Until Khaled turned up the volume
Hit the club with it come on homie they wilding
Nas done told you come on homie we major
Really Doe told you hoes where we staying
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playing

[Refrain]
Dawg it can't be
G.O.O.D. music the Grammy family
A little bit a stunting, flicking dawg it ain't deep
I'm only trying to spend what they claim you can't keep
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side
Like Lakeshore Drive
The Grammy Family

[Verse 2: Consequence]
Oh no it can't be
G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now I'm hopping out the limo or either the Lam B
And after music meetings with Ebro and Angie
It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me
And we, be in Miami
So when they spot me and Bentley it's gon be a stampede
Cause we be racing Bentleys no different than Grand Prix
Fam please, don't make my man squeeze
And we can take it to the gloves and I'll show you the hand speed
I started independent with owners from land speed
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed
And since I got my shot like I was calling "Man B"
A ho'll lose they spot and guaranteed a plan B
Will be waiting in the telly like Jamie and Fancy
Prolly painting they nails in nothing but they panties
And we'll be uptown like Jimmy and Cam be
Heading to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath
And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed
I know I got a buzz so platinum's the next step
So what ya'll wanna do when it comes to that next check
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is
Oh, Oh, Oh, The Grammy Family

[John Legend]
On Grammy night call it G.O.O.D. family night
Celebrate tonight
Oh it's alright, it's alright, yeah
